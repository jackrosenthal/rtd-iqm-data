• Lower labor force participation means more competition for talent
• Shifts in demand for goods and services
• Supply and demand for housing (near-term pressure)
• Income sources and amounts evolve as we age
• Downward pressure on federal, state, and local government tax
revenue; upward pressure on government expenditures

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
External Entities Report: East Colfax Avenue Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Project

May 13, 2025

REPRESENTATIVE
Jonathan L. Stewart, Program Director, Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, City and
County of Denver
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2008 Denver Strategic Transportation Plan provides a roadmap for transportation in Denver that
emphasizes multimodal transportation solutions and improved efficiency of the transportation system in
moving people. In addition to city-wide policies for a balanced transportation system, the Strategic
Transportation Plan includes recommendations for transportation system improvements throughout the
City. Among the identified improvement categories was RTD bus service. Because demand for RTD’s
15/15L bus service along Colfax Avenue was higher than all other RTD routes within Denver, CCD
selected the East Colfax Corridor to explore new transit service delivery approaches as a key step to
implement the Strategic Transportation Plan
A Streetcar Feasibility Study was conducted in 2010, followed by a more detailed 2012 analysis of
current and future needs along the Colfax corridor. In 2018, following six years of outreach and
community input, 75% of the public recommended center-running bus rapid transit (BRT) as the
preferred design alternative, with the remaining comments split between side-running and no-action. The
side-running option would have included either all-day or peak period bus-only lanes, similar to those
installed on Broadway; this option would have likely resulted in partial elimination of on-street parking.
No action would have resulted in no physical improvements and a continuation of the existing 15 and
15L bus patterns.
The design process and environmental review, which are necessary steps prior project construction,
began in late 2020 and was completed in April 2024. All federal transportation funding (described
below) requires compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, which includes a detailed
examination of potential project impacts and the identification of appropriate mitigation measures.
Typical areas of potential impact for a BRT project include land use, utilities, hazardous materials, traffic,
noise and vibration, visual, cultural-historic, air quality, and impacts during construction. The East Colfax
Avenue BRT project was subject to a thorough review of all relevant impacts and the identification of
necessary mitigation measures, and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) found that the project
complied with NEPA. Construction on the project began in October 2024 and is now approximately 10
percent complete; revenue service is anticipated in late 2027.

Packet Pg. 27

1.C.2

The project has the following key characteristics:
•
•
•

A curbside-running alignment in existing 15th Street and 17th-Street on-street bus lanes between
Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station.
Center-running alignment in dedicated bus-only lanes between Civic Center Station and East
Colfax Avenue/Yosemite Street.
Curbside-running alignment in mixed-flow traffic through the City of Aurora between East Colfax
Avenue/Yosemite Street and the existing RTD R Line light rail station at I-225.

The project will include BRT branding, and enhanced stations with American with Disability Act access,
shelter from the weather, and route/schedule information. The project also includes level boarding
platforms, offboard fare collection, enhanced lighting, security cameras, emergency telephones,
improved, safe pedestrian access and transit signal priority (TSP) treatments. Existing TSP along East
Colfax Avenue will be supplemented with new traffic signals. TSP modifies the normal signal operation
process to better accommodate transit vehicles by providing additional green signal time for buses than
would otherwise occur.
Upon implementation, the project will reduce transit travel time by 15 to 30 minutes (varies between
peak and off-peak periods), provide more affordable and reliable access to over 250,000 jobs and
community services along the corridor, create exciting streetscape, placemaking and economic
development opportunities, and enhance safety. The safety and security plan for the project after
implementation includes improved pedestrian scale lighting throughout the project area as well as
security cameras on each platform and lighting under the canopies and along the platform length.
During weekdays, service is planned to operate every 4.3 minutes during daytime peak and off-peak
periods, and every 15 minutes during evening periods. On weekends, service is planned to operate every
7.5 minutes during the day and evening. The service is planned to operate 24 hours each day during
weekdays and weekends, with limited 20- to 30-minute frequencies in late evening/early morning hours.
DISCUSSION
RTD and CCD are responsible for managing and delivering the East Colfax Avenue BRT Project. RTD is
the FTA Small Starts project sponsor and CCD is a subrecipient to RTD. The Small Starts program is a
nationwide, competitive grant program intended to help fund fixed guideway (rail and bus) transit
projects. As a part of the FTA Capital Investment Grants program, Small Starts is a rigorous, multi-step,
multi-year process of project development and review intended to assure the strongest transit projects
nationally are selected for federal funding. FTA uses a variety of project justification and financial
readiness measures to rank candidate projects against minimum criteria and tracks the progress of
projects annually through their program toward the award of a Small Starts Construction Grant. CCD is
managing the design and construction, including implementation of environmental mitigation measures,
of the project. RTD will perform subrecipient oversight and ultimately operate the BRT service. A critical
third-party stakeholder is the City of Aurora.

Packet Pg. 28

1.C.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
On July 29, 2024, the FTA announced it apportioned an additional $23M in Fixed Guideway Capital
Investment Grants for East Colfax BRT, bringing the total federal Small Starts allocation to $150M.
Denver secured $55M in funds for the East Colfax Avenue BRT through the Elevate Denver Bond
Program, which voters passed in 2017. The total capital cost for the project is $280,479,000;
comprised of $178,446,999 in total federal funds (63.62% of total capital cost) and $102,032,001 in
local match (36.38% of total capital cost).
RTD is not providing funding for project construction. The BRT service plan will result in no net increase
in fleet management or bus operating costs. RTD will assume operations and maintenance
responsibilities for ticket vending machines, validators, security cameras, and emergency telephones.
These costs have been included in the Five-Year Financial Forecast.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Budget Transfer for Articulated Buses Supporting Colfax
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Service

May 13, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
May 28, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to authorize the transfer of $51,000,000 from the unrestricted fund
balance for the purchase of 47 articulated 60-foot buses.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Acting Chief Financial Officer
BACKGROUND
In November 2024, the Board of Directors approved the 2025-2029 Five Year Financial Forecast (FYFF),
which included the replacement 60-foot articulated buses which are approaching the end of their useful
life. The replacement is scheduled for 2027 in the 2025-2029 FYFF and is not currently included in the
2025 Adopted Budget.
Currently, 47 of these buses operate along the Colfax corridor. To ensure these new buses are available
for the commencement of East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit revenue service, which is scheduled to begin in
2027, the procurement of these vehicles must begin in 2025. Staff anticipates the lead time for these
buses to be delivered is approximately two years after a formal order is placed with the vehicle
manufacturer. To proceed with this procurement in 2025, the related budgetary funding must be

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the amendment to Resolution Number 002, Series of 2021, which
created the “Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Policy” that permits and encourages the
development of affordable housing on RTD real property, in order to include guidelines for disposing of
RTD real property below fair market value or rent.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit-Oriented Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On February 23, 2021, the Board of Directors approved RTD’s first Equitable Transit-Oriented
Development (TOD) Policy (eTOD Policy). The objective of the eTOD Policy is to encourage affordable
housing on RTD real property at and along high-frequency transit stations and corridors. Successful
implementation of the eTOD Policy will increase ridership through transit-supportive land use, generate
revenue through joint development on RTD real property, and enhance community relationships. Staff
currently use the eTOD Policy to coordinate with state and local agencies, negotiate with developers,
and reduce administrative, acquisition, and construction costs in order to reduce overall development
costs and help enable affordable housing.
The State of Colorado established RTD to promote the public health, safety, convenience, economy, and
welfare of residents in the region and the state. Housing and transportation typically are the highest
costs in a household’s budget, affecting the vitality of household economy and welfare. Reducing
housing and transportation costs allows households to save for their health, safety, and convenience.
As a property owner, RTD has a unique opportunity to address the intent of its enabling legislation by
helping to create affordable housing on agency property, not only to address rising costs of living but
also to encourage transit use. Were RTD to encourage only market-rate development, it might lose the
opportunity to maximize ridership and satisfy the agency’s intent and mission. While RTD’s land holdings
suitable for joint development may barely make a dent in the region’s housing affordability problem, RTD
can be part of the solution and set an example for how to encourage affordable housing and increase
ridership at the same time.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 45

1.D.2

In April 2024, the Colorado legislature passed Senate Bill 24-214 (SB214), which removed the
requirement that RTD receive fair market value when disposing of its land from the RTD statute.
Specifically, §32-9-119.8(3), C.R.S., as amended by SB214, now states:
“Any person obtaining the use of any portion of a transfer facility ... for the provision of
residential uses or other uses shall be required to compensate the district by payment of
rent at fair market value, or, at the discretion of the district, by the provision of services
or capital improvements to facilities used in transit services, alone or in combination with
rental payments, such that the total benefit to the district is not less than the fair market
rental value of the property used by the person.”
With this statutory change, RTD now retains the discretion to determine the ground lease rent or sale
price of its property, provided the agency meets all other parcel-specific requirements (i.e., Federal
Transit Administration requirements, public financing requirements, deed restrictions, etc.). The eTOD
Policy indicates that RTD can negotiate price when a project will generate affordable housing or other
benefits to RTD, but the policy includes no other guidance. This lack of guidance creates uncertainty and
inefficiency for all parties involved in disposition decisions, including the developers who propose
projects, staff who review them, and the Board of Directors who make final decisions on the lease and
sale of valuable property.
Amending the eTOD Policy to define how and when RTD will allow reductions in purchase price or rent
will create a fair and predictable playing field for developers and guide RTD staff as they prepare for
Board of Directors decision-making. TOD staff engaged in numerous conversations through the fall of
2024 with regional housing agencies, jurisdiction planning and housing staff, real estate consultants, and
affordable housing developers to assess current needs and requirements in the affordable housing
market. The clear consensus among these varied groups is that the need for housing, and particularly
affordable housing, in the Denver region is enormous, but the costs are very high, and the financial
support and available subsidies are severely limited. The TOD group’s contacts agreed that land costs
are an important piece of the financing puzzle. If RTD is willing to reduce land costs, such lower costs
will reduce a barrier to affordable housing construction on RTD property.
All contacts emphasized that to be successful, RTD’s methods for reducing costs must be simple, allow
flexibility, and rely on the requirements and compliance standards of existing sources of financing.
Assembling the funding to build and sustain an affordable housing project is extremely complicated.
Banks, local jurisdictions, the State of Colorado, the Colorado Housing and Finance Administration
(CHFA), private foundations and others all have different, and sometimes competing, requirements.
Rather than create a framework that adds to the complexity of these precarious housing deals, RTD
should firmly and simply state its needs and preferences within existing funding requirements. The above
funders also all have stringent affordability and background check requirements. It is in RTD’s interests
to rely on those funders’ combined experience and internal underwriting rather than creating and
managing the agency’s own compliance structure.
In addition to meeting with regional partners, TOD staff also researched the policies and best practices
of transit agencies across the country. As shown in the table in the attached presentation, each agency

Packet Pg. 46

1.D.2

offers or does not offer reductions according to its unique political, real estate, and statutory
environment.
Accordingly, various factors inform an RTD property price/rent reduction policy. First, as noted earlier,
RTD now has the statutory ability to sell or lease land according to its own internal policy. Second, the
housing need in the Denver region is great and subsidies are limited. That said, RTD is a transit agency,
not a housing agency, and its land was purchased with taxpayer funds for transit purposes. However,
RTD is committed to the region’s economic and social welfare, both in statute and in practice. Next,
RTD property is dominated by active Park-n-Rides, some of which are a productive means of connecting
customers to the transit system, but some of which would create more ridership if developed as
affordable housing. Unlike transit agencies in other major cities, RTD property is neither valuable nor
plentiful enough to meaningfully affect the agency’s budget. And lastly, by Board policy, revenues from
land dispositions (both lease and sale) are deposited in the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
Considering local partners’ counsel for simplicity and flexibility, the wide range of national transit agency
policies, and RTD’s unique economic, political, and regional situation; TOD staff suggest a balanced
approach in amending Policy Element 5 of the 2021 eTOD Policy as shown in the attached resolution
and revised policy:
▪

▪

If developers can demonstrate a financial gap, RTD will permit a 30% reduction in land price or
rent if projects provide at least 50% of units to households making up to 60% of Area Median
Income (AMI)
▪ RTD may permit other discounts (either higher or lower) for projects with alternative
affordability programs, as determined by staff with input from local and/or state housing
officials
▪ No more than a 50% discount will be applied for any given project
RTD values the following:
▪ Mixed-income projects
▪ Maximizing allowable density
▪ Large unit sizes

This framework for reducing land price/rent sets a standard reduction of 30% if developers meet a
baseline affordability requirement of 50% of units making up to 60% of AMI. (For more information on
AMI, see the attached presentation.) Developers can then align their early-stage projects to this
benchmark. As project details are refined, developers may find the project works better with less or
more affordability. RTD can then adjust the reduction up or down accordingly with a clear maximum
discount of 50% off fair market rent. The language above also offers three values that are consistent
with regional needs: mixed-income, maximum density under zoning, and large unit sizes (i.e., three or
more bedrooms per unit). Developers who conform with those values would be most likely to achieve
the maximum allowable discount. The revised policy language also begins with the requirement that
developers demonstrate a financial gap; as such, if affordable housing can be financed on RTD property
without a reduction in land price/rent, RTD will not provide a reduction.

Packet Pg. 47

1.D.2

As the landowner, transit provider, taxpayer-funded political subdivision, and partner in the region’s
economic and social health, RTD must balance its fiduciary duties and operational responsibilities with
the state’s needs for housing. Setting clear, straightforward guidelines for land price/rent reductions will
create predictability for affordable housing developers, direction for RTD staff, and a baseline for Board
decision-making, while also providing meaningful assistance to affordable housing projects.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This amendment has no direct financial impact. Existing resolutions require that financial implications be
considered as part of any Board or staff decision related to TOD projects; these decisions are made on a
case-by-case basis.

1.D.2.a

WHEREAS, consistent with Senate Bill 24-214 and § 32-9-119.8(3), C.R.S., as amended, the
Board of Directors wishes to amend the 2021 Policy to provide guidelines for disposing of RTD
real property below fair market value or rent.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation
District to adopt the following amended Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Policy:
Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Policy
This Equitable Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Policy (the “Policy”) permits and encourages
the joint development of RTD-owned real property for the creation of housing affordable for lowincome households in order to increase transit ridership through transit-supportive land use,
generate revenue through joint development, and enhance community relationships. Informed by
research of local policies and peer agency practices, the Policy permits the use of a variety of
strategies to spur the development of affordable housing and sets a goal for affordable housing
development on agency land. The Policy is intended to reduce development costs and empower
staff to initiate negotiations with developers and coordinate with state and local agencies to
promote affordable housing as a transit-supportive land use at and along high-frequency transit
corridors.
In addition to researching ridership trends, parking demand, best practices employed by peer
agencies, and existing requirements for joint development, staff consulted with local jurisdictions
in the District and other transportation and housing partners to inform the Policy.
The Policy shall apply to residential development occurring on RTD land through joint development
transactions, wherein RTD has a continued interest in the site, either through a ground lease or
due to on-site or adjacent transit uses.
1. Affordability Goal: To permit and encourage the development of affordable housing, RTD
sets an aspirational and non-binding goal to include affordable residential units constructed
on RTD property. Across its portfolio, and from 2021 to 2031, staff shall endeavor to
reach the goal that 35 percent of the total residential units developed on RTD property will
be affordable to low-income households. Such households will have incomes that
correspond to affordability requirements at state and local levels, such as those determined
by the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority (CHFA). In any given year, in any given
jurisdiction, and in any given project, the number of affordable units created may be more
or less than 35 percent, but across all residential joint development projects, RTD will aspire
to achieve that goal. This goal will apply over a 10-year period, will be presented to the
RTD Board annually, and may be adjusted by the Board over time.

1.D.2.a

3. Shared Parking: Where there are opportunities to share parking between transit customers
and non-transit customers, and in situations where transit customers’ access to buses and
trains can be protected, RTD may consider opportunities for shared parking.
4. Expedited Administration: Staff may waive internal processing and development review
fees, minimize review times, and entitle agency property to attract developers and reduce
development uncertainty, costs, and schedules.
5. Negotiated Land Price: RTD will operate within the bounds of its existing statutory
requirements to allow reductions in purchase price or rent in exchange for affordable
housing development or other benefits to the agency. If developers can demonstrate a
financial gap, RTD will permit a 30% reduction in land price or rent if projects provide at
least 50% of units to households making up to 60% of Area Median Income (AMI). RTD
may permit other discounts (either higher or lower) for projects with alternative affordability
programs, as determined by RTD staff with input from local and/or state housing officials.
However, no more than a 50% discount will be applied for any given project. RTD will
favorably consider projects that provide for a range of household incomes, offer multibedroom unit sizes, and/or maximize allowable density.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Security Operations Budget Transfer

May 13, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
May 28, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $3,845,437.10 between operating expense
lines for transit security services.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Acting Chief Financial Officer
BACKGROUND
RTD’s security model consists of internal sworn POST-certified police officers, secondary employment
officers from local jurisdictions, and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD employees,
customers, facilities, and property.
Services provided under the current contract with Allied Universal Security Services (AUS) include but
are not limited to:
• Critical infrastructure security at RTD facilities including bus and rail stations
• Fare enforcement
• Patrol services
• Enhanced security presence during large-scale events
• Integrated security technology services
• Security command and dispatch center staffing and monitoring
• Federally required commuter rail Second Crewmember duties and responsibilities
By way of a Recommended Action scheduled to be considered during the Operations, Safety, and
Security Committee meeting scheduled for Wednesday, May 14, 2025, staff is recommending that the
Board authorize a one-year extension of the contract with AUS. This extension is needed to allow time
to conduct an open, fair and competitive solicitation process for system-wide security services
consistent with the summary scope of work unanimously approved by the Board on February 25, 2025,
as well as a transition period to ensure continuity of security services.
Funding for contracted security services for calendar year 2025 was included in the 2025 Budget. The
funds were allocated in part to the Transit Police and Emergency Management Department and in part to
the Rail Operations Division.
DISCUSSION
In considering this Recommended Action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to the Strategic
Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success.
This Recommended Action authorizes the transfer of funding between operating expense lines in the
amount of $3,845,437.10 from the Rail Operations Division to the Transit Police and Emergency
Management Department for the extension of the AUS contract through December 31, 2025. Funding

for the remainder of the extension from January 1, 2026, through June 30, 2026, will be requested
through the 2026 budget process.
FINANCIAL IMPACTS
There is no financial impact associated with this transfer, as funding for contracted security services is
included in the 2025 Budget.
