II.

Updates
 First Quarter 2012 Performance Measures
Jannette Scarpino gave a brief overview. There were no comments or concerns.
 Pension Accounting Update
Terry Howerter, CFO, introduced this item. The Government Accounting Standards
Board (GASB) has a proposed change in accounting for defined benefits plan which
will impact how RTD accounts for its DB pension plans. The reporting accounting
will require RTD to report as a liability, beginning in 2014, the difference between the
current value of plan assets and the present value of future pension obligations
(UAAL). If this new rule is applied, it could have an impact on the unrestricted fund
balance.
Doug MacLeod gave a brief summary update noting a couple of significant changes:
 Under the current accounting, the unrestricted fund balance as of
12/31/11 is $36,312,918. Under the proposed plan, this would result in
an unrestricted fund deficit of (29,260,551)
 Currently, the represented plan is at about 68.7% funded. The salaried
plan is at 97.7% funded. This changes substantially under the new GASB
accounting rule
Director Tayer commented he appreciates the transparency and questioned who
made the decision of the 8% that RTD contributes? Why is this item on the books?
Marla Lien explained the difference between the salaried defined benefits plan and
the represented plan. Under the salaried plan, the Board actually has control and
appoints trustees to the Pension Board that manages the fund.
Under the
represented plan, the union has a trust administration managed by a group of
trustees not controlled by RTD. Phil Washington added that the reason the 8% for

the union is on the books is that it is a negotiated amount. That negotiation includes
other components. Right now there is no action for the Board to take; however, if
the new GASB rule is applied, we would have to account for this impact on the
unrestricted fund balance.
Director Tobiassen questioned what impact on bond ratings, etc would this have if it
hit the books and we end up in a deficit. Doug MacLeod indicated he will need to
see the final ruling but they are looking at having a plan in place.
 April 2012 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod gave a brief summary update sharing that they will continue to watch
the numbers and will keep the Board updated on any changes.
III.

Other Matters
General Manager Washington shared that the Board made a $750,000 commitment in
regards to the I-25 managed lanes if CDOT received the $15M grant. Today he was
given word that CDOT did indeed receive the 15M grant so RTD’s commitment will kick
in. This is part of the TIGER grant.
Director Malpiede shared that she had the great opportunity to speak and represent RTD
at a function held at the Lakewood Gulch. She reiterated the draining issues that had
haunted that community over the years. Director Malpiede stated that through RTD’s
support along with the City, the draining issue has been fixed. RTD gave a generous
$3.85M towards helping improve that community and they are extremely thankful.
Terry Howerter expressed his gratefulness to the Board for the flowers and kindness
during his time of sorrow from the passing of his father.
