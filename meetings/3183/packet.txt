BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Contract Amendment and Transfer for the Platte Boiler
Project

Committee Meeting Date:
May 4, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
May 4, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager, or her designee, to amend contract
#19 DD-001 with Rasmussen Mechanical Services to increase the not-to-exceed amount from $278,182
to $838,000, and to authorize a budget transfer of $324,519 from the General Manager’s Contingency
Funds to fund the purchase of three replacement boilers at the Platte Division.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry J. Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Platte shops has three boilers servicing the facility. The heating plant requires two boilers to heat
offices, workshops, and the bus garage in cold weather. A third boiler provides spare capacity. The
boilers were replaced in 2014. The scope of work included three new boilers. Issues arose with the
boilers requiring that they be replaced, and new flues added. RTD filed claims with its insurance carrier
for all three damaged boilers. RTD has received funds ($278,182 minus a $100,000 deductible) for
Boiler #1. Claims for Boilers #2 and #3 are being negotiated and processed with litigation against the
original contractor scheduled for a July 2021 trial.
The initial notice to proceed with Rasmussen Mechanical Services was given on September 13, 2019
after the completion of RTD’s Invitation to Bid process Which resulted in a base bid of $278,182. One
amendment has been added to the contract for $10,648. Total contract value is currently $288,830 to
replace one boiler and modify the flues. Rasmussen Mechanical Services is a national firm with
experience with these systems. They were also the only qualified bidder for the replacement of Boiler
#1. With this information the RTD procurement and legal staff has completed a sole source evaluation
based upon the emergency nature of the required services needed.
Currently a budget of $589,481 has been allocated to replace Boiler #1 and the flues. A replacement
boiler was ordered and received. Further investigation showed in late 2019 that the other two boilers
were damaged in a similar way. They were operated in a reduced capacity through the 2020-21 heating
season but could not be replaced due to the claim and litigation process. RTD Facilities staff were able
to maintain heat to the facility without any interruptions through the last heating season.
DISCUSSION
Based on the expertise of Rasmussen, the original bid process, the timeline to get the work completed,
the configuration of the boiler room, and the cost of the additional work compared to RTD’s internal
estimate; the recommendation is to continue with Rasmussen Mechanical Services.
Thus, given that the remaining two boilers are compromised it is being recommended to replace all three
boilers. Cost to repair the boilers exceeds replacing them. Replacement work needs to begin before June

1, 2021 to have the heating plant back in operation for the 2021-22 heating season. RTD has a quote of
$838,000 from Rasmussen Mechanical to perform the work.
There was no SBE requirement for the project due to the emergency needs for services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This project utilizes 100% local funds that are included in the approved 2021 capital programs budget.
RTD Risk Management is proceeding with legal action to recover damages from the contractor who
installed the existing boilers and flues. The case is set for trial in July 2021. RTD has also filed claims
with its insurance carrier. Money recovered from these efforts will be returned to the general fund.
