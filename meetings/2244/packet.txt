Information

You will note we have changed our normal format to accommodate this rare opportunity to hear from
Former USDOT Secretary Slater. So that we can maximize this interaction, please give some thought to
meaningful, constructive dialog you may want to have with Secretary Slater as preparation for our APTA
Legislative meeting in March. For example, what are some of the mechanisms for funding the HWY
Transportation Trust Fund for a long-term solution? I am sure you can think of other questions.
Below please see a synopsis of Former USDOT Secretary Slater’s bio:
Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater helps clients integrate their interests in the
overall vision for the transportation system of the 21st Century—a vision he set as transportation
secretary to promote a safer, more efficient, environmentally sound and sustainable worldwide
transportation infrastructure. Mr. Slater also helps state and local government clients address the vexing
challenge of closing the gap between transportation demand and capacity by employing public/private
strategies and innovative financing solutions. Mr. Slater's practice focuses on many of the policy and
transportation objectives that were set under his leadership, including aviation competition and
congestion mitigation, maritime initiatives, high-speed rail corridor development, and overall
transportation safety and funding. He continues to embrace the framework he established as secretary
for making transportation decisions that called for more open, collaborative and flexible decision making
across the transportation enterprise here and abroad.
Mr. Slater’s bipartisan and inclusive approach to problem solving has earned him tremendous respect
and admiration on both sides of the aisle, enabling him to have one of the best relationships with the
White House, Congress, and business, labor and political leaders worldwide in the history of the
Department of Transportation (DOT). His work at DOT forever altered America’s and the world’s
appreciation of transportation as more than just concrete, asphalt and steel. Mr. Slater brings the same
strategic, results-oriented and collaborative approach to his public policy practice.
As secretary of transportation under President Bill Clinton, Mr. Slater passed several historic legislative
initiatives over his tenure, including the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), which
guaranteed a record $200 billion in surface transportation investment though 2003, and the Wendell H.
Ford Aviation Investment Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR-21), which provides a record $46 billion

1.C.1

to improve the safety and security of the nation’s aviation system. Under his leadership, the federal
transportation budget doubled and in the department’s "best in government" strategic and performance
plans, the scope and definition of transportation was expanded to include a focus on safety, mobility
and access, economic development and trade, the environment and national security.
Previous to his tenure as transportation secretary, Mr. Slater served as director of the Federal Highway
Administration, where—as the agency’s first African-American Administrator in its century-long history—
he oversaw the development of an innovative financing program that resulted in hundreds of
transportation projects being completed two to three years ahead of schedule with greater cost
efficiencies. Over that time, the federal transportation budget increased an unprecedented 104 percent.
Additionally, the department’s FY2001 budget of nearly $60 billion is the largest ever.

Date:

Board Meeting Date: February 17, 2015

Subject:

16th Street Mall Intersection Improvements,
Funding Intergovernmental Agreement with the
City and County of Denver

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
between the City and County of Denver (CCD) and the Regional Transportation District. The purpose
of the IGA is to set forth the rights, duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to construct intersection
improvements within the CCD Right-of-Way in conjunction with the 16 th Street Mall Reconstruction
Project. The intersection improvements will be funded by CCD, and the construction managed by
RTD.
BACKGROUND
Under a separate IGA, RTD and CCD are jointly reconstructing up to 3 ½ blocks of the 16 th Street
Mall (“Reconstruction Project”). The Reconstruction Project is partially funded by an FTA “Bus & Bus
Facilities Livability Grant.” RTD and CCD are providing local match funds of 20%. Because of late
scope modification request by CCD, the initial scope of the Reconstruction Project did not include
intersections of the Mall and cross streets within the limits of the project. This Intersection
Improvements IGA is intended to fill that gap. The cross-street intersections are generally as old as
the Mall (more than 30 years); the concrete paving is deteriorating, and the existing traffic signal
systems do not meet current CCD design standards.
DISCUSSION
The Reconstruction Project scope includes reconstruction of the transitway pavers, their setting bed,
in-situ resurfacing of the walkway pavers, upgrading the Mall utility infrastructure (e.g. electrical and
irrigation), constructing walkway “bulbouts” at cross-street intersections for pedestrian safety,
replacing the existing pedestrian lights, and upgrading the existing urban furniture (e.g. benches,
planters, water features). However, repairs and upgrades to the full intersections were not included
as part of the FTA grant.
If the intersections are not repaired concurrently with the Reconstruction Project, the work will need
to be done at a later date by CCD, resulting in additional disruptions to Mall shuttle operations,
additional construction delays to vehicular traffic and pedestrians, and further disruption to
businesses adjacent to the Mall.
The IGA addresses funding of the intersection improvements, which will be reimbursed by CCD with
DURA TIF funds. The IGA also addresses the design and construction management for the project
and identifies RTD as the managing entity. RTD will lead the design and construction management
of this project with support from stakeholder agencies. CCD will reimburse RTD for all direct costs
associated with the construction of the intersection.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 19

2.C.1

CCD will reimburse RTD 100% for the construction of the intersection improvements as outlined in
the final IGA.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or designee, to
execute an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City and County of Denver (CCD)
and the Regional Transportation District. The purpose of the IGA is to set forth the rights,
duties and obligations of CCD and RTD to construct intersection improvements within the
CCD Right-of-Way in conjunction with the 16th Street Mall Reconstruction Project. The
intersection improvements will be funded by CCD, and the construction managed by RTD.
2.
Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because delaying
the implementation of the IGA has serious impact to the schedule, budget, and RTD’s ability
to utilize approved grant funds, and would cause an extended delay of the Reconstruction
Project.
3.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because this would cause
major delays in constructing the intersection improvements. The result would be additional
disruption to Mall shuttle operation and further construction delays to vehicular and pedestrian
traffic along the Mall.

Subject:

Indemnification, Waiver of Governmental
Immunity and Purchase of Insurance for the
BNSF Railway Company on the North Metro
Rail Line

General

Board Meeting Date: February 17, 2015

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
Resolution agreeing to waive the defense of sovereign immunity to the extent it may under Colorado law
and to purchase insurance for the purpose of indemnifying the BNSF Railway company (BNSF) for claims
arising out of RTD’s ownership and use of the property to be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL,
including but not limited to environmental liability, claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out
of the use of automobiles, worker protection claims including those for railroad worker’s arising under
the Federal Employee’s Liability Act (FELA); and, the Board intends that the limits shown in the
Resolution shall be the limits to which immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.
BACKGROUND
On November 7, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors authorized the General Manager to enter into all
contracts necessary to implement design and construction of the NMRL. The corridor alignment
approved in the Environmental Impact Statement prepared for the NMRL includes right of way that RTD
needs to acquire from BNSF. BNSF has consistently maintained that it will not sell right of way for
passenger rail service if it will increase BNSF’s liability exposure. A requirement for RTD’s acquisition of
right of way from BNSF for the Gold Line and first electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Line was
that RTD agree to waive governmental immunity, purchase insurance and indemnify BNSF to the same
extent now required for the NMRL. The Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA) limits a
governmental entity’s liability for certain types of claims both as to dollar amount and matters for which
it could be liable. Waiver is permitted under state law so long as the waiver is by the governing body in
advance of claims and to a specified amount. RTD passed very similar resolutions for the prior BNSF
acquisitions. RTD also passed very similar resolutions for the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) for acquisition
of right of way for the NMRL and UP Property on the East, Gold and West Corridors.
DISCUSSION
RTD is acquiring property and entering into a Construction and Maintenance Agreement with BNSF for
approximately two and a half miles of right of way on the NMRL. RTD and BNSF trains will operate in
close proximity to one another. BNSF will not sell property for the use of passenger rail and thereby
increase its exposure to risk without indemnification. Federal law limits liability for passenger rail
accidents to $200 million per occurrence at the present time, and state law limits exposure to punitive
damages for both RTD and BNSF. RTD must acquire and maintain insurance in the amounts shown,

Packet Pg. 21

3.B.1

subject to review by the RTD and BNSF approximately every five years as a condition of RTD operations.
If RTD fails to obtain and maintain insurance and indemnify BNSF, RTD may be precluded from
operations in the shared portion of the corridor.
RTD will be required to maintain insurance and to indemnify BNSF for all claims for which BNSF is or
may be liable that would not have occurred but for RTD’s use of the corridor for passenger service,
regardless of fault. Responsibility for claims for which both parties may be liable are allocated after start
of RTD operations. Neither party may bring claims against the other. RTD will be required to obtain and
maintain Railroad Protective Liability insurance in the amount of at least $200,000,000 (two hundred
million dollars) or such greater amounts as may be allowed by federal statutes setting liability caps for
passenger rail accidents. Worker’s compensation, auto coverage, property damage and pollution liability
coverage are required. RTD must indemnify BNSF for claims its employees make if such claims are the
result of RTD’s use of the corridor. RTD is required to waive governmental immunity up to the limits of
coverage.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is already obligated to acquire coverage for both BNSF and UP in all shared passenger and freight
corridors under previous contracts and resolutions. Insurance is included in the Owner Controlled
Insurance Program for the NMRL. Operations phase coverage will cost only slightly more to RTD than if
this resolution were not passed, because coverage must be provided for portions of the West, and
virtually all of the East, Gold and Northwest Rail Corridors. Funding for the operations phase coverage
will be provided each year as part of the annual operating budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached Resolution agreeing to waive the defense of sovereign
immunity to the extent it may under Colorado law and to purchase insurance for the purpose of
indemnifying the BNSF Railway company (BNSF) for claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and
use of the property to be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL, including but not limited to
environmental liability, claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out of the use of
automobiles, worker protection claims including those for railroad worker’s arising under the
Federal Employee’s Liability Act (FELA); and, the Board intends that the limits shown in the
Resolution shall be the limits to which immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.
2.

Do not pass the attached Resolution. This will require an alternative alignment for the NMRL and
significant cost and time delays to the project. This is not recommended.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION No. ___, SERIES OF 2015
Indemnification, Waiver of Governmental Immunity and Purchase of Insurance for the
BNSF Railway Company on the North Metro Rail Line
Whereas, On November 7, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors authorized the General
Manager to enter into all contracts necessary to implement design and construction of the
North Metro Rail Corridor (NMRL) within the authorized project budget; and
Whereas, the alignment approved in the Environmental Impact Statement prepared
for the NMRL includes right of way that RTD needs to acquire from the BNSF Railway
Company; and
Whereas, the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA) limits both RTD and
BNSF’s liability for punitive damages arising out of the use of the railroad right of way
shared with or acquired from a railroad for passenger rail services; and
Whereas, the CGIA limits RTD’s liability but allows a governmental entity to waive
immunity otherwise available up to an amount specified by the entity; and
Whereas, a condition of sale from the BNSF is that RTD acquire insurance,
indemnify BNSF and waive governmental immunity that would otherwise be available
under Colorado law for any incidents, accidents or losses occurring in the shared
BNSF/RTD portion of the NMRL alignment; and
Whereas, the BNSF requires RTD to obtain and maintain insurance for so long as
the BNSF operates in the shared corridor, to waive immunity and to indemnify it for any
claims and losses caused by use of the shared corridor for the construction or maintenance
of RTD improvements and the operation of passenger rail service and to apportion liability
in circumstances not covered by RTD indemnity obligations; and
Whereas, the CGIA allows RTD to waive limits under the CGIA and to indemnify
third parties for liabilities other than punitive or exemplary damages.
Now therefore be it resolved that:
The RTD Board of Directors agrees to waive the defense of sovereign immunity to the
extent it may under Colorado law and to purchase insurance for the purpose of
indemnifying BNSF for claims arising out of RTD’s ownership and use of the property to
be acquired from BNSF for the NMRL including but not limited to environmental liability
claims both regulatory and in tort; claims arising out of the use of automobiles, worker
protection claims including those for railroad worker’s arising under the Federal Employer’s
Liability Act (FELA); and, the Board intends that such limits shall be the limits to which
immunity is waived pursuant to C.R.S. 24-10-114.
