Board Meeting Date: May 31, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approves
and adopts the Pass Program Working Group objective, commitments and guiding principles.
BACKGROUND
In September of 2015, the Board of Directors approved a fare level increase to the Business and
Neighborhood Eco Pass programs and directed to staff to establish a Pass Program Working Group. The
Board Action approved in September of 2015 specifically stated: “This working group will include RTD
staff as well as stakeholders from across the District. The working group will define goals for pass
programs as well as reevaluate the 2009 Board policy for utilization based pricing to incorporate the new
fare structure and average fare analysis once smart card tap data is available.”
Staff prepared a draft of an objective, commitments and guiding principles to set the course of the Pass
Program Working Group. At the February 2016 Planning and Development Board Committee meeting,
staff presented and received input from the Board on that draft. Input received from individual Board
Directors confirmed that the draft objective, commitments and guiding principles did reflect their
priorities and concerns regarding Pass Programs.
DISCUSSION
It is important that Staff receive Board approval of the objective, commitments and guiding principles of
the Pass Program Working Group prior to the establishment of the group. These directional elements will
lead the efforts of Staff and the working group. The recommended objective, commitments and guiding
principles are detailed below.
Objective: Improve RTD pass programs to better serve customers of the district.
To achieve this objective, the Pass Program Working Group will fulfill the following commitments:
1. Revisit and refine goals for each individual pass program.
2. Refine pricing and administration of each pass program.
3. Recommend pass program policy revisions to the Board of Directors.
Below is a list of the Guiding Principles for the Pass Program Study:
1. Cost Effective Administration
2. Equitable Access
3. Improve Customer Convenience
4. Increase Ridership
5. Meet Strategic Budget Plan Revenue Targets
6. Promote Greater Brand Loyalty
7. Provide RTD revenue certainty
8. Simplify Passenger-Operator Interaction
