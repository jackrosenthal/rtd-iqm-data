BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 13, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

March 8, 2013

Board Meeting Date: March 19, 2013

Subject:

Radio-CAD/AVL
Owner’s
Representative
Contract Fifth-Year Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with IBI
Group (IBI) as the Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and Computer Aided
Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Systems (Contract 18DH016). This contract
amendment is for the fifth year of a five year period of performance. The scope and fee are
renegotiated annually. The fifth-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of $1,700,000 for a total contract
value to date of $9,622,000.

BACKGROUND
The scope of work and fee for this Board-approved five year period of performance is negotiated
annually to allow the contract to adjust to changes related to the design choices RTD makes. RTD
anticipates this fifth year of the IBI Group contract to be extremely busy the first half of the year to
complete management of installations and system acceptance testing. Additionally, radio coverage
improvements and decommissioning of the old radio system will require significant efforts.
RTD has been operating a 450MHz analog radio communication system that supports voice and data
communications between dispatchers, bus and light rail operators, Transit Police and field support staff
for the RTD’s operations. The radio system is integrated with the CAD/AVL system. The system was
initially implemented in 1993 and is past the last years of the industry’s common 15-year service life.
Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires changes to the available radio
frequency bandwidth, which are not compatible with the current radio and CAD/AVL design. This
narrow-banding requirement was to have been completed by December 31, 2012. RTD received a one
year extension from the FCC in order to complete construction of the system.
RTD requires the services of an Owner’s Representative (OR) for the Radio-CAD/AVL Replacement
Project to provide highly technical, managerial, business services to support the agency through the
normal project steps from requirements, procurement, through acceptance testing and on into
operations. The OR will provide unique technical skills unavailable internally to RTD.
RTD issued Contract No. 18DH016 to obtain an Owner’s Representative for the Radio-CAD/AVL
Replacement Project. IBI was selected in 2009 by competitive procurement to be RTD’s Owner’s
Representative for the Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project. The contract requires eight (8) percent
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) participation. IBI is currently exceeding their goal.
This is a complex and dynamic project so the scope and fee are reviewed and negotiated each year. IBI
has successfully completed the work anticipated for the earlier years and it is in RTD’s interest to
authorize contract amendment for the fifth year of the contract to continue needed support.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 13, 2013

From:

David Genova, Assistant General Manager

Date:

March 13, 2013

Board Meeting Date: March 19, 2013

Subject:

Contract Award for the Rio Court Maintenanceof-Way Renovation/Tenant Finish Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager,or his designee, to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder,
Calahan Construction, in the not-to-exceed amount of $3,472,630 for renovation and tenant finish of
the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way (MOW) facility.
BACKGROUND
The site/facility was acquired to accommodate the relocation of the Burnham Yard lead track due to the
FasTracks West Corridor project. The lead track that was relocated was aligned through the south end
of the property. The original plan was to raze the entire building that resided on the site. After
consideration, it was determined to remove only a portion of the building and utilize the rest for a new
light rail maintenance-of-way (MOW) facility needed to accommodate growth of the light rail system.
The renovated facility will house all light rail MOW requirements to maintain all track work, signal,
communication and power systems for all RTD light rail corridors including the West Line and I-225. All
functions will be relocated from the existing Mariposa MOW facility that no longer accommodates light
rail’s expanded needs. The alternative to this project is to demolish the building, design and construct a
new building. This alternative is not recommended because it will be much more costly, take much
longer to demolish, design and construct, and most likely result in a smaller facility due to property setbacks for new construction.
DISCUSSION
The project was advertised on January 30, 2013. The pre-bid conference was held on February 12,
2013 and the bids were received on March 1, 2013 as follows:
1. Kiewit Construction – $3,449,474
2. Calahan Construction - $3,472,630
3. White Construction - $3,807,500
4. Newstrom-Davis Construction - $4,575,889
After review of Kiewit’s bid documents they were determined to be non-responsive. The bid difference
between Kiewit and Calahan is $23,156.
SBE INVOLVEMENT
The SBE goal was advertised at 25%. Calahan Construction is a certified SBE firm and they will also
subcontract work to other SBE firms.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the project is included in the 2013 approved budget. The construction budget is
$4,905,403 with $495,452 being CDOT FASTER grant funding and $4,409,951 of local funding.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager,or his designee, to award a
contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, Calahan Construction, in the not-to-exceed
amount of $3,472,630 for renovation and tenant finish of the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way (MOW)
facility
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, Calahan Construction, in the not-toexceed amount of $3,472,630 for renovation and tenant finish of the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way
(MOW) facility. Project shall be rebid. This is not recommended as the bids are considered
competitive and are below RTD’s budget.
3. Do nothing. Cancel project and redirect funds. This is not recommended as the project is required to
accommodate the expanded MOW operations that are necessary to support FasTracks.

Objective

Background
Title VI and Environmental Justice Overview
Since 1972, The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Office of Civil Rights has
required recipients and sub-recipients of federal financial assistance to certify
compliance with the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations and FTA
guidance effectuating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These regulations
and guidance require recipients to continuously ensure equity in the provision of
transit service by avoiding, minimizing and mitigating disparate impacts on minority
and low-income communities whenever possible.
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is a recipient of FTA financial assistance
and is therefore subject to the Title VI compliance conditions associated with the
use of these funds pursuant to FTA Circular 4704.1B, “Title VI Requirements and
Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients,” dated October 1, 2012;
and Section 12(b) of the FTA Master Agreement. Concerted with the Title VI and
its requirements is the Environmental Justice program.
In April of 1997, the DOT issued U.S. DOT Order 5610.2(a) affirming that it will
monitor its programs, policies and activities to ensure that disproportionately high
and adverse effects on minority and low-income populations are avoided,
minimized or mitigated in compliance with Executive Order 12898, “Federal
Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low–Income
Populations.” On August 15, 2012 the FTA issued Circular 4703.1,
“Environmental Justice Policy Guidance for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients,” effectuating DOT Order 5610.2(a).
This document outlines how RTD will ensure equity in the provision and benefits of
its services, as required and specified in FTA Circular 4702.1B (Title VI) and FTA
Circular 4703.1 (Environmental Justice).

Agency Profile

Approximately 99.1 million passengers boarded RTD service vehicles in 2012. This
figure represents an average of about 328,109 in weekly boardings. The RTD’s
transportation network includes 148 regular fixed bus routes, 10,025 bus stops,
75 park-n-Ride transit facilities, 35 miles of light rail track and 36 light rail stations.
In addition, the RTD has a fleet of 1,025 regular buses and 153 Light Rail vehicles.
Since 1983 the RTD has been governed by a statutorily-created, 15-member Board
of Directors. Each member is elected to serve a four-year term. There are
approximately 173,000 voters in each of the 15 director districts and most of the
individual director districts cross county boundaries. In addition, the daily activities
of the RTD are administered by the General Manager and eight department offices.
The 2011 total operating budget was $377.2 million. The single largest source of
revenue to the District is the sales tax.

The Colorado General Assembly created the Regional Transportation District (RTD)
as a political subdivision of the State in 1969. According to Section 32-9-102,
C.R.S., the creation of the RTD was intended to “promote the public health,
safety, convenience, economy, and welfare of the residents of the district and of
the state of Colorado.”

1.B.3.a

RTD’s Family of Services

1. Local: Local routes provide service in higher density/urban areas. Due to
urban growth, shifting boundaries, or District minimum ridership standards,
these routes may also cross through areas of lower density. These routes
stop an average of every 600 feet or no more than 1 or 2 blocks apart.
a. Limited: Limited routes provide service in higher density/urban areas,
some may even cross all of the metro area. Compared to Local routes,
these routes only make specific selected stops, usually high-volume
transfer points or major traffic intersections. This allows for faster
running times and for passengers to reach their destination quicker
than riding the Local route.
2. Express: Express routes provide service from high-transfer or high-density
ridership locations such as Park-n-Rides, to other points of high ridership
such as the downtown Denver stations. These routes only make selected
stops on the outer parts of their route. They collect passengers and then
continue without stopping to their final destination.
3. Regional: Regional routes provide service from one urban/suburban area to
another. These routes run the majority of their route on major traffic
corridors such as highways or interstates. Regional service can act as a
'Local' route on the first part of a trip, collecting passengers on its way
through town to a Park-n-Ride or station. It can also start at a Park-n-Ride or
station and then continue without any further stops to its final destination.
4. Sky Ride: SkyRide buses depart from each SkyRide stop at least once an
hour and as frequently as every 15 minutes. SkyRide buses operate seven
days a week, 365 days a year.
5. Call-n-Ride: Call-n-Ride is an on-demand, personalized bus service that
travels within select RTD service areas that do not meet the service standard
to demand fixed route service.
6. Light Rail: Light Rail lines generally provide transit service to the equivalent
of Local and Express bus service along a fixed guideway dedicated to Light
Rail vehicles; providing trips as long as 12 miles and as short as one city
block.

The District’s population is diverse and with equally diverse needs, thus one size
does not fit all. To accommodate the varying needs of the District, RTD provides a
Family of Services which primarily includes the following:

1.B.3.a

RTD’s 2,340 square mile service area (primarily consisting of the Denver Metro
area) is inhabited by 2.7 million people, living in diverse communities, with high
concentrations of minorities (above 32% representation in a Census tract/block
group) and low-income populations (above 38% representation in a Census
tract/block group).

Customer Satisfaction Survey data shows Denver Local and limited Bus service is
primarily utilized by minority and low-income populations.

RTD believes in and is committed to the public involvement process including the
use of community advisory committees, panels and boards. Each advisory group is
tailored to meet the specific needs of its program or activity. During the formation
of these advisory groups, RTD consistently seeks participation from minorities by
directly soliciting organizations which represent minorities. RTD appoints members
of the public to three advisory groups:
1. The RTD Customer Panel
2. The WIN Steering Committee
3. The FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee

The RTD Customer Panel
The RTD Customer Panel, comprised of 16 panel members, is a matched cross
section of the RTD ridership as determined from the most recent Customer
Satisfaction survey. A new panel is selected each year. This year we obtained
over 300 applications.
There is one panel member selected from each director district, as determined by
the address supplied on the application. There is also one alternate selected, the
alternate can be from any district.
Some panel members have been new riders, others have ridden their entire
lives. The diversity in demographics has contributed to the right mix of opinion
and experience.

The Community Participation Plan is a guide for the Regional Transportation
District’s (RTD) ongoing public participation endeavors. Its purpose is to endure
that RTD utilizes effective means of providing information and receiving public
input on transportation decisions from low income, minority and limited English
proficient (LEP) populations, as required by Title VI and the Civil Rights Act of
1964 and its implementing regulations.
Under federal regulations, transit operators/agencies must take reasonable steps to
ensure the Limited English Proficient (LEP) persons have meaningful access to their
programs and activities. This means that the community participation
opportunities, normally provided in English, should be accessible to persons who
have a limited ability to speak, read, write, or understand English.
In addition to language access measures, other major components of a the
Community Participation Plan include; public participation design factors; a range
of public participation methods to provide information, to invite participation and/or
to seek input; examples to demonstrate how population-appropriate outreach
methods can be and were identified and utilized; and performance measures and
objectives to ensure accountability and means for improving over time.

Summary of Developing a Comprehensive Plan
In order to engage the low income, minority and LEP populations in the
development of the Public Participation Outreach Plan, RTD will conduct multilingual community meetings throughout the RTD service area. RTD will coordinate
with community-based organizations, offering translation services in multiple
languages. During the meetings RTD will give surveys and accept comments and
take notes during the meetings. All of this information will be gathered and used to
develop a comprehensive Community Participation Plan.
RTD will supplement the extensive public participation process by conducting
informational meetings with the community-based organizations serving LEP
populations in the RTD service area. RTD will also conduct telephone interviews
and focus group meetings throughout the RTD service area.

Community Participation Plan

1.B.3.a

The input from this community outreach will provide RTD with the needed
information to develop the most successful and comprehensive Community
Participation Plan/Program.

RTD must develop a comprehensive Community Participation Plan to guide public
involvement efforts and enhance access to RTD’s transportation decision-making
process by low-income, minority and LEP populations. Based on both input
collected from these populations regarding effective public involvement and RTD
will develop the overall goals, guiding principles and appropriate outreach methods
that RTD could use to reach out to the low income, minority and LEP populations.
Pursuant to Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI regulatory guidance,
federal funding recipients and subrecipients should seek out and consider the
viewpoints of minority, low-income and LEP populations “in the course of
conducting public outreach and involvement activities.” (FTA Circular 4702.1A)
This guidance also requires that an agency offer “early and continuous
opportunities for the public to be involved in the identification of social, economic
and environmental impacts of proposed transportation decisions at RTD.” To meet
these requirements, RTD will develop a Community Participation Plan, a document
intended as a guide for how RTD will deepen and sustain its efforts to engage
diverse community members throughout its service area. The Community
Participation Plan will include example public participation strategies, designed
using the Community Participation Plan goals, principles and methods.
The Community Participation Plan will offer early, continuous and meaningful

the plans goals, principles and methods.
RTD currently conducts community outreach and has public participation during
service changes, and construction projects by offering public meetings, mailing
campaigns, door hangers, flyers, working with community organizations and other
methods. To develop a comprehensive plan RTD must first gather information from
the minority, low-income and LEP populations then develop a comprehensive plan.

RTD is fully committed to ensuring that Limited English Proficient (LEP) individuals
are provided meaningful access to our various services and programs. Presently,
RTD is in the process of completing the four-factor analysis to determine the
combination of means and methods necessary to provide meaningful access to LEP
communities. While in the beginning stages, RTD has made considerable progress
toward completing the first two steps of task one in the four-factor framework:
Task 1) The number or proportion of LEP persons eligible to be served or likely to
be encountered by the program or recipient. The first two steps involve
the following:
Step 1) Inquire with staff to determine how LEP persons interact with the
agency;
Step 2) Identification of LEP communities, and assessing the number or
proportion of LEP persons from each language group to determine the
appropriate language services for each language group;

Contact with LEP persons
In general, RTD interacts with the public at large in a multitude ways that include
but are not limited to:
1. Transit Service (bus, light rail, etc…)
2. Fare Media Sales Outlets
3. Administrative Offices
4. Public Meetings and Events
Thus far, inquiries with staff have revealed that our most frequent contact with
LEP individuals comes by way of our Transit Service, particularly, Local and Limited
bus service. Local and Limited bus routes provide service in higher density/urban
areas, which holds the District’s most diverse communities.
In an effort to obtain a better indication of nature in which LEP individuals are
encountering RTD, the Title VI Manager will be conducting focus groups and/or
surveys with the various employees who directly interact with the public at large
on a regular basis. Central to this inquiry of staff will be LEP groups identified via
the most recent American Community Survey (ACS) and Census data.

To identify the LEP communities and assess the number and proportion of LEP
persons from each language group in the RTD service, ACS and Census data were
analyzed. According to ACS data, 219,543 of the 2.6 million people in the RTD
service area, speak another language while speaking English less than very well. Of
the 39 languages spoken by LEP individuals in the District 17 language groups
meet the safe harbor threshold. Below is a breakdown of those languages and the

RTD is currently in the process of completing the four-factor analysis identifying
the specific concentrations of each language group, the frequency in which LEP
individuals come in contact with RTD programs and the nature of importance of
RTD programs to LEP individuals. Once this data has been collected and analyzed,
a language assistance plan addressing the needs of the LEP community will be
developed and implemented. The target date to complete the language assistance
plan and begin its implementation is June 2013.

RTD Title VI Sub-recipient Compliance Process
As a recipient of Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”) assistance, RTD and its
sub-recipients must comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI
prohibits the exclusion from participation in, denial of benefits or subjection to
unlawful discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal assistance
on the grounds of race, color, national origin or income status. To meet its
enforcement responsibilities under Title VI, RTD has implemented a sub-recipient
monitoring process.
On an annual basis, the RTD Title VI Manager will ensure the following actions are
taken and documented in writing affirming that RTD and its sub-recipients comply
with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B;
Each year sub-recipients must provide RTD with an FTA Civil Rights
Assurance/Signed Assurance signed by its Chief Executive Officer which attest
that all records and other information required under FTA Circular 4702.1B have
been or will be compiled, as appropriate, and maintained;
Each sub-recipient must implement a Title VI complaint process and provide RTD
with a list of active lawsuits and Civil Rights Complaint summary alleging
discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin;
Each sub-recipient must post its Title VI Policy Statement in prominent
conspicuous and accessible locations throughout its facilities.
Sub-recipients must take responsible steps to ensure meaningful access to the
benefits, services, information, and other important portions of their programs and
activities for individuals who are Limited English Proficient (LEP);

Language Assistance Plan Completion

In general, sub-recipients should have a public participation process that offers
early and continuous opportunities for the public to be involved in the identification
of social, economic, and environmental impacts of proposed transportation
decisions. Efforts to involve minority and low-income people in public involvement
activities can include both comprehensive measures, such as placing public notices
at all stations and in all vehicles, and measures targeted to overcome linguistic,
institutional, cultural, economic, historical, or other barriers that may prevent
minority and low-income populations from effectively participating in a recipient’s
decision-making. Sub-recipients must file with RTD documentation of its public
participation plan;
Each sub-recipient further agrees to comply with, and assure compliance by its
third party subcontractors at any tier under the Project, with all requirements of the
FTA Title VI Program pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B and 49 CFR 21.5(b)(2) and
49 CFR 21 .5(b)(7), Appendix C to 49 CFR Part 21.

Title VI Equity Analyses

1. The January 2011 Fare Change
2. The January 2012 Service Changes
3. West Rail Line Service Changes (New Start)

Equity Analysis Policies
In order to comply with the FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, as mentioned
above, RTD has established a Major Service Change policy, a Disparate Impact
policy and a Disproportionate Burden policy. Each of these polices govern what
service changes will be evaluated and how those service changes will be
evaluated. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25%
addition or reduction in the service hours of any route that would remain
in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major service changes will
be subject to an equity analysis which includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. Adverse Effect: is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in
service which includes but is not limited to: elimination of a route,
shortlining a route, rerouting an existing route and an increase in
headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects, and
analyze those effects, when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely
affect a minority population 10% more or less than non-minority
populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not
adversely affect a low-income population 10% more than non-low-income
populations; this level of impact is considered a disproportionate burden.
A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty
Guidelines.

21 | P a g e
Packet Pg. 31

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

During this reporting period RTD has implemented two different sets of major
service changes and one fare change. Accordingly, RTD has also completed and
attached the equity analysis of the following fare change and major service
changes.

1.B.3.a

The Circular also requires that the formation of these policies endure the public
decision-making process. To accommodate this requirement, RTD’s Civil Rights
Division circulated a draft of the Title VI Equity Analysis policies and solicited
public comment through various channels of communication to include formal
meetings, informal meetings, U.S. mail, email and telephone. Through the
various mediums we reached out to a wide array of individuals, groups and
organizations and received fairly consistent feedback on the proposed policies.
Once educated on Title VI and the new requirements of the FTA Circular, we
found that most participants are primarily concerned with the low-income
community and the disproportionate burden policy. Most consistently the public
expressed a great interest in the definition of a disproportionate burden on low income communities. Additionally the public inquired about access to the equity
analysis of disproportionate burdens of the low-income community. Fortunately,
the public feedback generally provided concurrence with the draft policies,
requiring no significant changes to the policies.
After consideration of public input, the policies were finalized and are attached
herein. With these policies in place RTD, completed its equity analysis of the
West Corridor Service plan.
The RTD Board of Directors approved each the Title VI Equity Analysis policies.
The meeting minutes from the RTD Board meetings in which the policies were
reviewed are included within the Equity Analysis of the West Rail Line included
as an appendix.

If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a
disproportionate burden, RTD will consider modifying the proposed service
change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden.

1.B.3.a

The FTA requires transit providers that operate 50 or more fixed route vehicles
in peak service and are located in urbanized areas to monitor their service
standards and policies with respect to fixed route services. These standards and
policies are monitored by comparing the performance of minority routes to nonminority routes, to ensure that service standards are adhered to indiscriminately.
A minority route is defined as any route that has 1/3 of its revenue mileage in
proximity to a minority population above the average of the entire service area.
Per the most recent data RTD has seen an average of 21% minority population
per census tract (see Demographic Profile maps for greater detail).
RTD has sampled and compared routes from Local (urban and suburban), Light
Rail and Express fixed route service to ensure equity in the application of our
service standards and policies. Regional and Sky Ride fixed route services were
excluded from this exercise (as permitted by the regulations) since none of the
routes in these service categories meet the threshold to be classified as minority
routes.
Results of the service monitoring are presented in the tables below:

The results of service monitoring in this report reveal no disparities or
justification for service adjustments.

As RTD continues to expand its service via the FasTracks project, service
standards and policies will continue to evolve to suit the nature of the service
demands in the District. RTD is currently in the process of revisiting the current
service standards and creating new standards. Included in the new standards to
be developed is a Service Availability standard and a Transit Amenities Policy in
compliance with the new Title VI requirements.
The projected date for creation of the Service Availability standard and Transit
Amenity policy is June 2013. RTD will have documented the results of service
monitoring associated with the newly adopted Service Availability standard and
Transit Amenities Policy by September of 2013.

Background
Since 1972, The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Office of Civil Rights has
required applicants for and recipients and sub-recipients of Federal assistance to
certify compliance with the requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act that
requires recipients to evaluate significant system-wide service and fare changes
and proposed improvements at the planning and programming stages to determine
whether those changes have a discriminatory impact.
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is a recipient of FTA funding assistance
and is therefore subject to the Title VI compliance conditions associated with the
use of these funds pursuant to FTA Circular 4704.1A, “Title and Title VIDependent Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients,” dated May
13, 2007; and Section 12(b) of the FTA Agreement.
On February 11, 1994, Executive Order 12898, entitled “Federal Actions to
Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low–Income
Populations,” was signed into law. The order requires federal agencies to identify
and address disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental
effects, including interrelated social and economic effects, on minority and lowincome populations. In April of 1997, the Department of Transportation issued its
own Environmental Justice Order affirming that it will monitor its programs,
policies and activities to ensure that disproportionately high and adverse effects on
minority and low-income populations are avoided, minimized or mitigated.
The Title VI Program requirements as specified in the FTA Circular 4702.1A, Title
VI and Title VI-Dependent Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients,
and the Department of Transportation Order to Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, define the components that
should be addressed by RTD and were the basis for the selection of elements
reviewed and summarized in this document.

Agency Profile
The Colorado General Assembly created the Regional Transportation District (RTD)
as a political subdivision of the State in 1969. According to Section 32-9-102,
C.R.S., the creation of the RTD was intended to “promote the public health,
safety, convenience, economy, and welfare of the residents of the district and of
the state of Colorado.”

Title VI requirements

Approximately 97.2 million passengers boarded RTD service vehicles between
October 2009 and September 2010. This figure represents an average of about
322,121 weekday boardings. The RTD’s transportation network includes 148
regular fixed bus routes, 10,025 bus stops, 75 park-n-Ride transit facilities, 35
miles of light rail track and 36 light rail stations. In addition, the RTD has a fleet of
1,025 regular buses and 153 Light Rail vehicles.
Since 1983 the RTD has been governed by a statutorily-created, 15-member Board
of Directors. Each member is elected to serve a four-year term. There are
approximately 173,000 voters in each of the 15 director districts and most of the
individual director districts cross county boundaries. In addition, the daily activities
of the RTD are administered by the General Manager and eight department offices.
The 2010 total operating budget was $373.1 million. The single largest source of
revenue to the District is the sales tax.

1.B.3.b

The purpose of this report was to conduct an analysis of RTD’s compliance with
the Title VI Program requirements relative to Chapter V, Part 4, 49 CFR Section
21.5(b)(2), 49 CFR Section 21.5(b)(7) and Appendix C to 49 CFR part 21,
specifically regarding fare increases, as specified in the FTA Circular 4702.1A,
Title VI and Title VI-Dependent Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients, and the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Order to Address
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations.

Methodology
In order to comply with the above mentioned section of Title VI, RTD evaluated the
impacts of the 2011 fare changes using the following Federal guidelines in FTA
Circular 4702.1A Section V.4a, Option A:
1) Assess the effects of the proposed fare on minority and low-income
populations.
a) Fare changes. For proposed changes that would increase or decrease fares
on certain transit modes or by fare payment type or payment media, RTD
analyzes any available information generated from ridership surveys
indicating whether minority and low-income riders are more likely to use the
mode of service, payment type, or payment media that would be subject to
the fare increase.
2) Assess the alternatives available for people affected by the fare increase or
major service change.
a) Fare changes. For proposed fare changes, RTD analyzes what, if any,
alternative transit modes, fare payment types, or fare payment media are
available for people affected by the fare change. This analysis should
compare the fares paid under the change with fares that would be paid
through available alternatives.
3) Describe the actions the agency proposes to minimize, mitigate, or offset any
adverse effects of proposed fare and service changes on minority and lowincome populations.

Objectives

4) Determine which, if any, of the proposals under consideration would have a
disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and/or low-income riders.
Recipients can implement a fare increase that would have disproportionately
high and adverse effects provided that the recipient demonstrates that the
action meets a substantial need that is in the public interest and that
alternatives would have more severe adverse effects than the preferred
alternative.

Reasons for the Proposed Fare Increase
RTD’s single largest source of base system operating revenue is a .6 percent sales
and use tax collected within the RTD district. In 2009 this sales and use tax
generated $223 million to support the provision of RTD bus and light rail services.
The sales and use tax revenue constituted approximately 69% of the base revenue
sources in 2009.
The second largest source of the RTD base system operating revenue is fares paid
by RTD passengers. Farebox revenue includes passenger fares for regular route
services, special service fares, and farebox revenue collected and retained by
private carriers under contract with the RTD. The only service for which a fare is
not charged is the 16th Street Mall Shuttle in Downtown Denver. The impacts of
fare changes and structures are forecasted using an elasticity-based model.
In 2009, RTD’s adopted farebox revenue represented 30% of RTD’s base revenue
sources compared to 69% from the sales and use tax as shown in chart 1 below.

The Base operating budget deficit is projected to be $18 million short in 2011. This
shortfall must be addressed. A number of external factors are adversely impacting
the budget. The primary factor is the decline in the sales and use tax revenue.
Since the sales and use tax revenue is not within RTD’s control, RTD must
consider passenger fare increases and other alternative revenue enhancements and
cost reductions to solve the projected budget shortfall. These alternatives include:
Continued salary freezes for the 3rd consecutive year
Continued controlled hiring freeze
Continued fuel cost hedging
Voluntary staff furloughs
Service reductions; and
New revenue sources and new grants.

Sales and use tax is directly impacted by the local economy. Chart 2 below shows
the projected 2011 RTD sales and use tax revenue is $233 million or $18 million
below the 2007 level when the local economy was stronger.

1.B.3.b

Statistical analysis also found this preference existed regardless of level of service
(Local, Express, or Regional). For Local service approximately 71% of respondents
prefer fare increases of $.25 per ride to service reductions. For Express service
approximately 60% of respondents prefer fare increases of $.50 per ride to service
reductions. For Regional service approximately 62% of respondents prefer fare
increases of $.50 per ride to service reductions.
In addition to comparing service level, other segmentation analyses were
performed. Some highlights from the segmentation analyses can be found below:
Transit dependent Express and Regional service users statistically prefer
fare increases over service reductions.
A summary of the statistically significant differences in preference for fare
increases versus service reductions among patrons of different household
income categories can be found in the Chart 3 below. In the table below the
household income category’s average preference rating is compared against
the average preference rating of the other household income category on
the same row. For example, in the first row we can see that the average
preference rating of 3.1 for those in the household income category of
“Under $15,000” is statistically lower than the 3.9 average preference
rating from those in the “$50,000 to $74,999” household income category.
The average rating of 3.1 is interpreted as having equal preference for fare
increases or service reductions on a scale where 1 equals “Strongly prefer
fare increases and 5 equals “Strongly prefer service reductions,” where the
higher numerical rating of 3.9 indicates a stronger preference for fare
increases over service reductions. In several cases, some of the highest
household income categories statistically prefer fare increases over service
reductions to a greater degree than those in the lowest income category
(Under $15,000).

At the request of the RTD Board of Directors, a survey was initiated to assess the
tradeoffs customers would be willing to make between fare increases and service
cuts. A total of 390 responses were received (365 from the web survey and 25
from paper surveys). The results found that the majority of respondents (66%)
preferred fare increases to service reductions.

Historical fare trends were considered in RTD’s fare increase. A detailed summary
of RTD’s fare history from 2002 thru 2008 is shown in Appendix A. The 2011
fares compared to the 2009/10 fares are shown in Appendix B. In 2011, the
percentage increase for the base cash fare was essentially 12.5% across all
service types, rounded for customer convenience.
Over the past several years, RTD has increased fares to help achieve a balanced
budget.
Regional cash fares have increased $0.50 since 2009 – from $4.50 to
$5.00 in 2011, which is an increase of 11.1%.
Express cash fares have also increased $0.50 since 2009- from $3.50 to
$4.00 in 2011, which is an increase of 14.3%.
The Local base fare increased $0.25 since 2009 –from $2.00 to $2.25 in
2011, which is an increase of 12.5%.
If fares had not been increased, some needed services would have been curtailed.
Chart 4 shows the changes in RTD cash fares by service type from 1999 to 2011.

Assessing Fare Change on Low-Income and Minority Groups

Weekday RTD passengers have a higher proportion of lower income households
than the general population as shown in Table 1A. Approximately 39% of the bus
riders come from households with incomes below $25,000 compared to 19% in
the general population. In 2008, the U.S. Bureau of the Census’s poverty
threshold was $22,025 for a family of four (see Exhibit E).

Table 2B. Ethnic Origin – Light Rail Riders vs. General Population

For the January 2011 fare increase (Appendix B), RTD analyzed available
information generated from on-board customer surveys indicating the mode of
service and payment type that minority and low-income riders are more likely to
use. For the purpose of this report, a low-income household is defined as one with
less than $15,000 in annual income. (See Federal Guidelines for Poverty in
Appendix D)
Ridership by low-income and minority riders vary greatly by mode of service. The
2008 Customer Satisfaction Survey found that over one out of five bus riders
(22%) have household incomes below $15,000 per year and more than four out of
ten bus riders (44%) are minorities. Low-income riders use an above average
proportion of Denver Local/Limited and Longmont Local service. (See Tables 3 &
4). More affluent riders are more frequent users of Express and Regional services.

Tables 5A-C below shows that a high proportion of low to moderate income riders
(under $35,000 household income) are more likely to pay their fares by cash and
tokens. Upper middle to high income riders (over $35,000 household income) are
more likely to purchase pre-paid fares (monthly passes, ValuPass, 10-Ride
Ticketbook, Eco Pass, College Pass). Low-income students in the college pass
program use the pass in a higher proportion than more affluent students.

Alternative Discount Fare Programs for Low-Income Groups

Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program
To assist low-income passengers, RTD has maintained a non-profit (501(c) (3)
agency reduced fare program that is available for clients of over 200 participating
social service agencies within the RTD service area. Agencies serving low-income
groups include: Denver Department of Human Services, Colorado Coalition for the
Homeless, Denver Rescue Mission, Denver Area Youth Services, Jefferson County
Department of Human Services, and others. Agencies purchase tokens and
monthly passes from RTD at a deep discount and clients of these agencies, who
meet the income eligibility guidelines of the RTD program, may be eligible to
receive tokens and passes free of charge.
In 2010, agencies purchased tokens and passes, with a face value of
approximately $4.3 million, at a discounted price of approximately $2.0 million as
shown in Table 6.

In order to minimize, mitigate, or offset any adverse effects of fare changes on
low-income and minority populations and to comply with federal requirements,
RTD offers the following alternative discount fare programs:

In 2011, RTD is further exploring potential program modifications to lessen the
impact of the 2011 fare increase on low-income populations. RTD conducted a
survey of Non-Profit Agencies participating in the program to allow agencies to
voice opinions on potential changes to the program. The findings of this initial
survey indicated that the majority of agencies would provide more fare media to
their clients if the discount rate for the fare products was increased.
Following the survey, RTD created a panel of Non-Profit Agency representatives to
provide more detailed suggestions and other proposals to further enhance the
efficacy of the program. Some of the potential program enhancements that are
currently being discussed include increasing the discount on fare media in order to
keep agency costs constant while enabling the agencies to provide more fare
media to clients, replacing the existing tokens valued at $0.25 with tickets from
10-Ride ticket book fare media products and other potential enhancements.

College Pass Program
RTD started offering College Pass programs in 1990/91. The College Pass
program is a deeply discounted unlimited access pass program targeting college
and university students. The program is open to all colleges in the service area. In
2010 the RTD had nine (9) different college contracts throughout the Denver metro
area with student enrollment over 100,000. Students at the University of
Colorado at Boulder and the three colleges on the Auraria campus receive a 45%
discount off the cash fare per boarding. Total revenue from the College Pass
Program was $9.6 million in the 2009/2010 academic year.

Students, Seniors, and Disabled Discount Fares
United States Code 49 U.S.C. 5307 requires that, during non-peak hours, elderly
and handicapped individuals or individuals presenting Medicare cards issued to
them under the Social Security Act will not be charged more than 50 percent of
the peak hour regular adult fare for any transportation using or involving a facility
or equipment financed with federal funds. In the 2011 RTD fare structure, the
fares for seniors and the handicapped are no more than 50 percent of the fares
charged adult passengers. Students (age 19 and under) also pay no more than 50
percent of the fares charged adult passengers. These reduced fare programs
exceed Federal Requirements by providing the discount all day and not just during
the non-peak periods.
For more information on Student, Senior, and Disabled fares see Appendix B.

As part of the 2009 fare changes, the RTD Board of Directors authorized RTD staff
to implement a pilot program to test a discounted unlimited access pass program
for low-income residents of local housing authorities. RTD staff was directed to
implement the program at two housing locations each in three counties: Adams,
Boulder and Denver.
The Low-Income Housing Pass is priced like RTD’s Neighborhood Eco Pass, based
on survey data, which provides an estimate of current RTD revenue from residents
at each housing location. An unlimited access pass is then made available to all
residents at the housing location at a highly discounted individual price.
As of July 2009, the program has been implemented at two predominately
Hispanic housing locations in Boulder County and is awaiting implementation at
four more locations in Adams and Denver Counties. The program will be evaluated
at the end of the year.

Services for Individuals with Disabilities
access-a-Ride and access-a-Cab
This program has provided complementary paratransit service since 1994. It
provides curb-to-curb, demand-responsive paratransit service to ADA-certified
customers in order to meet RTD’s obligation under
Title II of the Americans with Disability Act of 1990
(ADA). It is a shared-ride, public transit service that
meets ADA requirements by providing advanced
reservation transportation to passengers with
disabilities who are unable to board, ride, or exit a
wheelchair lift-equipped, fixed route bus/light rail
vehicle or whose disability does not allow them to
travel to and from a bus/light rail stop. access-a-Ride vans do not operate over a
fixed route or on a fixed schedule. Typically the van may be dispatched to pick up
several passengers at different pick-up points before taking them to their
respective destinations. access-a-Ride has approximately 44,000 certified
customers, of which 14,000 were active within the past year. Operations are
provided by several contracted carriers to help meet service demand. The 2009
adopted budget for access-a-Ride was approximately $35 million.
RTD complies with Code of Federal Regulations 49 C.F.R. 37. This regulation
states that the fare for a trip charged to an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
paratransit-eligible individual for special paratransit service shall not exceed twice

Low-Income Housing Pass Pilot Program

1.B.3.b

To help meet rapidly growing demand and control increasing operating costs of
access-a-Ride, RTD implemented the access-a-Cab program in 1997. Under this
program, RTD subsidizes fares on Yellow Cab (300 cabs), Metro Taxi (498 cabs),
and Shamrock Taxi for ADA-certified passengers. Vehicles are generally owned,
inspected, maintained, and dispatched by the taxi company, and leased to
independent contractors (drivers) whose income depends on passenger trips.
access-a-Cab does not meet the requirements for complementary service under the
ADA and is not meant to replace access-a-Ride. However, only ADA-certified
persons are eligible for RTD subsidies on the access-a-Cab service.
Most paratransit customers have an annual household income under $15,000
(64% of access-a-Cab users, and 51% of current access-a-Ride users).

the fare that would be charged to an individual paying full fare for a trip of similar
length, at a similar time of day, on the transit entity’s fixed route system. Eligible
passengers must live within ¾ miles of an RTD fixed bus or light rail route. There
are no trip purpose restrictions.

1.B.3.b

The January 2011 fare changes applied a 12.5 percentage increase to the base
Local cash fare. Applying the percentage Local cash increase to other modes of
service, and rounding to the nearest $.25, affected other fare categories relatively
uniformly. Express cash fare increased 14.1% and Regional cash fare increased
11.1%. Express and Regional fares are higher than Local fares due to added
benefit and cost of providing less stops, faster service, and more direct service.
RTD bus fares (Local, Express, Regional) are applied to light rail based on distance
traveled as defined by zones traveled.
As previously noted in Tables 1-5 and in rider profiles, low-income and minority
riders primarily utilize Local (Denver Local/Limited and Longmont Local) services,
and primarily pay their fare with cash and/or tokens, and transfers. Since lowincome and minority riders rely on transfers more frequently than higher income
groups, maintaining the free one-way transfers will help lessen the impact of the
fare increase on this segment.
After analyzing the transit and demographic profiles of low-income and minority
riders, RTD took the initiative to insure that low-income cash fare riders were not
more adversely affected by the fare increase than affluent pre-paid fare riders. As a
result, RTD used the percentage increase in the base cash fares in determining the
pre-paid fares. Unlimited use monthly passes were tied to increases in cash fares
by using the following formula: cash fare times 22 days times 2 trips less 20%
discount. For example, a regular Local monthly pass would cost $2.25 times 22
days times 2 trips less a 20% discount, equals $79.00 rounded to the nearest
quarter. Monthly pass holders can enjoy the savings of unlimited trips above the
fixed price point plus the convenience of not having to carry cash.
As previously outlined, RTD also has established a number of alternative discount
fare programs to minimize, mitigate, or offset any adverse effects of proposed fare
changes on minority and low-income populations located in its service area.
In conclusion, this analysis of the fare increase finds the changes would not result
in disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority or low-income riders
compared to non-minority and non-low-income riders.

Background
Since 1972, The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Office of Civil Rights has required
applicants for and recipients and sub-recipients of Federal assistance to certify
compliance with the requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act that requires
recipients to evaluate significant system-wide service and fare changes and proposed
improvements at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those
changes have a discriminatory impact.
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is a recipient of FTA funding assistance and
is therefore subject to the Title VI compliance conditions associated with the use of
these funds pursuant to FTA Circular 4704.1A, “Title and Title VI-Dependent Guidelines
for Federal Transit Administration Recipients,” dated May 13, 2007; and Section 12(b)
of the FTA Agreement.
On February 11, 1994, Executive Order 12898, entitled “Federal Actions to Address
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low–Income Populations,” was
signed into law. The order requires federal agencies to identify and address
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects, including
interrelated social and economic effects, on minority and low-income populations. In
April of 1997, the Department of Transportation issued its own Environmental Justice
Order affirming that it will monitor its programs, policies and activities to ensure that
disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority and low-income populations are
avoided, minimized or mitigated.
The Title VI Program requirements as specified in the FTA Circular 4702.1A, Title VI
and Title VI-Dependent Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients, and
the Department of Transportation Order to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations, defin e the components that should be
addressed by RTD and were the basis for the selection of elements reviewed and
summarized in this document.

Agency Profile
The Colorado General Assembly created the Regional Transportation District (RTD) as
a political subdivision of the State in 1969. According to Section 32-9-102, C.R.S., the
creation of the RTD was intended to “promote the public health, safety, convenience,
economy, and welfare of the residents of the district and of the state of Colorado.”
Approximately 97.2 million passengers boarded RTD service vehicles between October
2009 and September 2010. This figure represents an average of about 322,121
weekday boardings. The RTD’s transportation network includes 148 regular fixed bus
routes, 10,025 bus stops, 75 park-n-Ride transit facilities, 35 miles of light rail track and
36 light rail stations. In addition, the RTD has a fleet of 1,025 regular buses and 153
Light Rail vehicles.

Title VI requirements

Since 1983 the RTD has been governed by a statutorily-created, 15-member Board of
Directors. Each member is elected to serve a four-year term. There are approximately
173,000 voters in each of the 15 director districts and most of the individual director
districts cross county boundaries. In addition, t he daily activities of the RTD are
administered by the General Manager and eight department offices. The 2011 total
operating budget was $377.2 million. The single largest source of revenue to the District
is the sales tax.

RTD’s Service Area
Figu re 1. RTD Service Area Map
The RTD service area consists of
2,348 square miles, as shown in
Figure

and
includes
40
municipalities and all or parts of eight
counties: The City and County of
Denver, the City and County of
Broomfield, the counties of Boulder
and Jefferson, the western portions of
Adams and Arapahoe counties, the
northeastern portion of Douglas
County, and a very small portion of
Weld County annexed by Brighton,
Longmont and Erie.
More than 2.8 million people, or

Colorado’s total population, reside
within the District.

Objective
The purpose of this report was to conduct an analysis of RTD’s compliance with the
Title VI Program requirements relative to Chapter V, Part 4, 49 CFR Section 21.5(b)(2),
49 CFR Section 21.5(b)(7) and Appendix C to 49 CFR part 21, specifically regarding
service changes, as specified in the FTA Circular 4702.1A, Title VI and Title VIDependent Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients, and the U. S.
Department of Transportation (DOT) Order to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations.

Methodology

1) Each proposed service change resulting in an i ncrease or decrease, greater than or
equal to 25% of a route’s service hours, will be assessed to determine the impact on
minority and low-income populations.
a) Service changes. RTD will analyze a combination of US census data, the latest
applicable customer satisfaction and travel characteristics surveys and Service
Performance (Appendix) to determine the impact the potential change will have
on the minority and low-income population.
b) Span of service. For proposed changes that would reduce or expand hours and
days of service, RTD will analyze any available information generated from
ridership surveys that indicates whether min ority and low-income riders are more
likely to use the service during the hours and/or days that would be eliminated.
2) Assess the alternatives available for people affected by the major service change.
a) Service Changes. For proposed service changes, RTD will analyze what, if any,
modes of transit or transit routes are available for people affected by the service
expansions or reductions. This analysis will involve an assessment of the current
route with the travel time and cost to the rider of the alternatives.
3) Determine which, if any, of the proposals under consideration would have a
disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and/or low-income riders.
4) Describe the actions proposed to minimize, mitigate, or offset any adverse effects of
the service change on minority and low-income populations.
5) Should RTD implement a service change that would result in disproportionately high
and adverse effects, it will be demonstrated that the action meets a substantial need
that is in the public interest and that alternatives would have more severe adverse
effects than the preferred alternative.

In order to comply with the above mentioned section of Title VI, RTD evaluated the
impacts of the 2012 service changes using the following Federal guidelines in FTA
Circular 4702.1A Section V.4a, Option B:

Assessment: Low-Income and Minority Population Transit
Activity

For the January 2012 Service Changes, RTD analyzed available information generated
from on-board customer surveys (Appendices C & D) indicating the mode of service that
minority and low-income riders are more likely to use. For the purpose of this report, a
low-income household is defined as one with less than 25,000 in annual income. (See
Federal Guidelines for Poverty in Appendix E)
Based on the latest survey data RTD Bus Survey Weekday RTD passengers have a
higher proportion of lower income households than the general population as shown in
Table 1A. Approximately 39% of the bus riders come from households with incomes
below $25,000 compared to 20% in the general Denver-Aurora- population. In 2010,
the U.S. Bureau of the Census stated the average household size in the Denver metro
area was 2.52, with an applicable poverty threshold of $18,530.

Ridership by low-income and minority riders vary greatly by mode of service. The 2008
Customer Satisfaction Survey found that approximately two out of five bus riders
(39.1%) have household incomes below $25,000 per year and nearly half of all bus
riders (44%) are minorities. Low-income riders u se an above average proportion of
Denver Local/Limited and Longmont Local service (See Tables 3 & 4). More affluent
riders are more frequent users of Express, Regional and Light Rail services.

Local service.

Summary: Transit Behavior of Individuals living in Low-Income
Households
The 2008 customer satisfaction surveys indicates demographics and transit behavior of
riders living in low-income households (under $25,000 annual income) relative to middle
and higher income households are summarized as follows:
Transit Behavior:
 Primarily use Local services
 Majority pay transit fare by cash and tokens
 Transit dependent – do not have a car and/or have a physical disability that prevents
them from driving a car
 Make higher proportion of transfers than middle to higher income household riders
 Take higher proportion of non-commute trips tha n the typical rider
 Take the bus during the off-peak hours more tha n middle to higher income household
riders
 Take shorter trips than middle to higher income household riders
 A Higher proportion access transit by walking to a bus stop than middle to higher
income household riders

Equity Analysis of RTD Service Changes
The Reason for the Service Changes
In August of 2010, the RTD Board of Directors authorized the creation of a Fiscal
Sustainability Task Force to develop a formal written report detailing opportunities for
operating efficiencies and revenue enhancements to ensure RTD fiscal sustainability in
the long term. The Task Force consisted of members of the general public/civic leaders,
RTD Board representatives and representatives from the RTD Senior Leadership Team
and included a broad range of financial, transit, planning and legal experience and
expertise. This Task Force met on 11 occasions during the eight (8) month period from
November, 2010 through June 2011 and presented its findings and recommendations to
the RTD Board of Directors on June 28, 2011. Key findings of the Task Force included:





Having an efficient and effective transit system is a lynchpin in ensuring the
region’s economic and environmental health and quality of life;
RTD is efficiently operated and benefits form a culture of continuous
improvement;
There is no “silver bullet” but that a combination of policies and strategies must
be implemented to achieve fiscal sustainability; and
In general, the Task Force recommendations build on RTD’s tradition of fiscal
prudence.

Specific recommendations from the Task Force included recommendations in the areas
of Fiscal Policy, Revenue Enhancement and Expense Reduction. Included among these
recommendations was a recommendation to optimize the agency’s service offering to
focus on maximizing ridership in a cost effective manner while thoughtfully examining
the tradeoffs or balance between providing service throughout the District and focusing
on serving the greatest number of riders and prov iding a level of service that could be
sustained within available revenue streams. This was also referred to as “right sizing”
the level of service.

1.B.3.b

During this same period of time, the RTD staff and Board were proceeding through the
annual Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) planning cycle. The SBP is essentially a six (6)
year plan that lays out the organization’s operating and capital needs and expenses
within the context of reasonably anticipated revenues available to implement the
objectives of the District. This planning cycle began with the initial presentation of the
SBP overview to the Board in April of 2011 and culminated with the RTD Board’s
adoption of the 2012 – 2017 Strategic Budget Plan on August 16, 2011. The 2012 –
2017 SBP adopted by the Board reflected the severe financial challenges for RTD, and
all sales tax supported entities, over the past several years. It also reflected the
continued fiscal challenges that RTD will face for the foreseeable future and it included
a reduction of approximately $12 million in service cost in order to balance the 2012
budget and provide the basis for long term financial sustainability for the organization.
Accompanying the significant proposed service changes was a great deal of interest
and concern from the public. To accommodate the high level of public interest and fully
assess the impact of the proposed service changes on the public, 24 public hearings
were held throughout the district. Subsequent to those meetings, RTD reexamined and
when necessary altered those proposed changes to accommodate the concerns
expressed in public commentary. It was recommended by the Operations & Customer
Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the January 22, 2012
Service Change package as revised resulting in annualized cost savings of
approximately $10,307,470 (appendixed).

Summary of Changes
RTD provides a “Family of Services” which includes Local (bus), Express (bus),
Regional (bus), Sky Ride (Bus), Light Rail, Access-a-Ride (Paratransit) and Call-n-Ride.
Over 60% of the existing routes within RTD’s Family of Services endured some sort of
modification to include, but not limited to route truncating, route merging, reductions in
span of service or trip frequency. The final 100+ changes resulted in 27 routes meeting
the 25% service hour threshold required to be analyzed. Those 27 routes, the nature of
their service changes and relevant transit alternatives are listed in Table 5.

After analyzing the transit and demographic profile of low-income and minority riders,
RTD examined the proposed service changes for adverse impacts on the the lowincome and minority populations, when compared to affluent and non-minority
populations.
As previously noted in Tables 1-4 and in rider profiles, low-income and minority riders
primarily utilize Local (Denver Local/Limited and Longmont Local) services. These
routes are generally high performing routes as they predominately serve transit
dependent populations including minority, low-income and/or disabled individuals.
Conversely, Regional, Express, Call-n-Ride and Light Rail transport a higher proportion
of more affluent and non-minority passengers. Accordingly, a keen observation of
changes to Local services in comparison to Regional, Express, Sky Ride, Call-n-Ride
and Light Rail service is central to the analysis.
As the biggest family member in RTD’s Family of Services, the Local bus service
provided the lion’s share of the service change package. Local routes provide service in
higher density/urban areas and in some cases may even cross the entire metro area
(Cities of Denver, Aurora, Lakewood, etc…). Each change applied to the Local routes
was examined for effects and mitigation if necessary. Fortunately, Local routes are fixed
in densely populated areas and provided transit users with multiple options to reach
their destinations. In most cases, we found that patrons of the Local service retained
multiple transit options despite changes as severe as route elimination. However, there
were some cases where it was determined that a viable alternative was not available to
our customers.
In instances where viable alternatives were not identifiable, mitigating measures and
(where necessary) proposed changes were retracted to minimize the impacts of each
change. In cases of route elimination and route truncating, RTD attempted to minimize
the impact on patrons by ensuring a viable transit alternative was available. The major
benefit of the nature of the Local service is the availability of various options. Evidence
of this is identified in our latest bus survey (appendixed) which indicated that nearly 60%
of all Local service riders must use a transfer to reach their destination. Hence the
motivation to ensure at least one transit option remains where there is viable demand.
For example, the local route 60 was eliminated and the local route 67’s span of service
was reduced to peak hours. Since both the 60 and 67 routes service the Colorado
Center for the Blind (frequented by low-income and disabled individuals); RTD decided
to mitigate the impact of this service change by replacing the lost fixed route service
with the Southeast Jefferson County Call-n-Ride service. Call-n-Ride is a personalized,
curb-to-curb bus service that travels within select RTD service areas, giving patrons
service similar to that of a taxi within a defined radius. Fortunately, not every change
warranted mitigating measures.

Summary Analysis of RTD Service Reduction Equity

Adjustments to frequency and individual trip eliminations in the January 2012 changes
proved to deliver negligible impacts to the individual rider. Inspection of these changes
revealed that each proposed trip elimination and frequency reduction was the product of
underperforming trips mostly during the off-peak period. RTD’s service standards allow
for the review of individual trips to improve overall route performance. Thus, each trip
elimination and frequency adjustment is the result of low ridership numbers that would
otherwise taint the performance of the route in its entirety. While frequency reductions
and trip reductions certainly reduce number of opportunities to patronize a route, public
comment validated it’s a small concession for the purposes of keeping the transit option
altogether. This approach wasn’t only used in applying changes to Local Service routes,
but to all routes.
Express, Regional, Sky Ride, Call-n-Ride and Light Rail services, which primarily
transport affluent and non-minority riders, sustained major reductions as well. From
route eliminations to individual trip reduction, underperforming routes were adjusted to
fit ridership demand. Of the quintuplet, the Express service sustained the greatest level
of service reduction with four route elimination s (out of 22 routes) and multiple
reductions in trips and frequency. Two Call-n-ride routes were eliminated as well,
accompanied with service span adjustments to increase overall route performance. The
Light Rail and Regional services were subjected to mainly frequency and service span
reductions that fell just short of the 25% service hour threshold.
As stated previously, RTD’s Family of services experienced changes across the board.
A side-by-side comparison of the January 2012 service changes provided an illustration
of route optimization rather than arbitrary cost-cutting. The vast majority of the changes
originated due to routes exhibiting a level of performance under the established service
standard applicable to that mode as established in the RTD Service Standards
(Appendix A) and the Service Performance repo rt of 2010 (Appendix B). There are
instances where underperforming routes/trips remain with little to no alteration, due to a
lack of comparable transit alternatives. This methodology of reducing service to fit the
transit demand only in the presence of a transit alternative has allowed RTD to avoid
any disparate impacts to minority and low-income communities. Thus this analysis of
the January 2012 service changes finds the changes do not result in disproportionately
high and adverse effects on minority or low-income riders compared to RTD’s service
area at large.

INTRODUCTION
A. Overview
RTD continually receives requests for changes to existing service and for new
service in growing areas of the District. Additionally, RTD may be operating
some services that are not attracting enough riders to justify their cost. In order
to be consistent in the evaluation of service proposals, and to ensure that the
service being provided represents the most cost-effective use of the District's
resources, a set of service standards is maintained by RTD.
The specific standards, targets or minimum/maximum values for the standards,
and a procedure for applying these standards, are presented in this document.
Since service standards are intended to optimize usage of the District's
resources, they are updated periodically to reflect changes in the District goals
and resources. The procedure for updating the standards is described in Section
I.C.
B.

Application of Service Standards
There are two primary applications for the ongoing use of the service standards.
These are the use of standards to evaluate existing services, and use of
standards to evaluate proposals for new service.
The application of standards to existing routes is a flexible process. The purpose
of the standards is to help identify routes which are most in need of service
changes, such as restructuring to eliminate lower-productivity segments or
branches, adjusting service frequency to better reflect the demand for service, or
providing additional promotion of less patronized routes where appropriate.
Routes, which do not meet standards, are not automatically designated for
elimination. Elimination of routes is only intended as a last resort, when it has
been determined that no cost-effective actions are available to improve the
productivity of the route.
The standards for evaluation of existing routes are not intended to preclude
changes to routes that meet these minimum standards. In many cases, it may be
possible to improve the productivity of routes that meet the minimum standards
by making changes to headways or trip times. Since the overall mission of RTD
is to "provide safe, clean, reliable, courteous, cost-effective public transit which
affords desirable mobility options and to provide service to all areas of the
District," these standards should not be used to prevent changes to improve the

I.

1.B.3.b

The availability of financial resources, represented by the annual budget, is the
bottom line for these standards. Service expansion may occur when additional
funds are available and contraction may occur otherwise. In any case, selection
of which services to provide or curtail is based on these performance standards
and no service is considered guaranteed or beyond review. The RTD Board of
Directors, with input from RTD staff and the public, is responsible for making
decisions on service recommendations.
The evaluation of new service proposals will take place as proposals are received
or needs identified. The most recent values of the standards for existing routes
will be used to evaluate the proposed new services. Decisions regarding
implementation of new routes will be made through the service planning process.
New routes will be expected to meet all applicable route design standards
described in Chapter II, Section D, but will not be expected to meet the
productivity standards described in Chapters II and III until they have been in
operation for at least six months. Demonstration, experimental, and cost sharing
services are also handled in this manner.
C.

Updating of Service Standards
The service standards are intended to support the goals and objectives of the
District. Since these objectives and the resources available to attain them can be
expected to change over time, the standards will be revised periodically to reflect
those changes.
The service standards will be reviewed on a bi-annual basis.
At that time,
experience with the service standards over the previous time period, as well as
changes in the District's goals and objectives, will be used to determine whether
any standards should be added or revised.
The numerical values of productivity standards will be updated each year, using
ridership, revenue and cost figures for the most recent twelve-month period for
which data are available. The rankings are based only on those routes that
existed for the entire year. Routes which were eliminated during the year will not
be included because they cannot be identified as candidates for revisions.
Routes that were introduced during the year will not be included in determining
the new standards since they are not required to meet the productivity standards
until they have been in operation for at least six months. However, these routes
will be evaluated separately, using the service standards contained in this
document.

efficiency of existing routes, as long as the changes meet the route design
standards.

1.B.3.b

II. PRODUCTIVITY STANDARDS
A.

Derivation and Use of Standards
The productivity standards are used to identify routes and services for
appropriate marketing and possible revision or elimination. Separate standards
are identified for each class of service. Routes are evaluated on ridership (either
boardings per in-service mile or per trip, depending on the class of service) and
on the economic measure of subsidy per passenger. These standards are based
on the performance of the least productive 10 percent of the routes in each
service class for either the ridership or economic measure, or on the least
productive 25 percent of routes in both measures. The basis for the standards
will be reviewed in conjunction with the cost recovery standards in Chapter VII,
and may be revised if necessary.
New services should meet the applicable standards for their class of service after
six months of operation. All new services will be reviewed after six months of
operation and routes that have not shown adequate progress toward meeting the
standards will be targeted for cost-effective actions to increase productivity or
for elimination.
For the purpose of applying the standards, Local and Limited routes will be
divided into three groups based on area-type land-use designations: CBD routes
(routes which serve the Denver Central Business District), Urban routes, and
Suburban routes (refer to Appendix B - RTD Service Classes for descriptions).
These groupings of Local and Limited routes will enable the comparison of routes
with similar service characteristics. Express, Regional and sky Ride routes will be
evaluated as separate classes due to their different service characteristics. For
the purposes of evaluating productivity, Light Rail will be measured against the
standards established for CBD Local routes, except where otherwise noted.
The standards for evaluating portions of routes are intended for use in identifying
needed service improvements, for making modifications to specific portions of
existing routes, or for identifying low productivity segments of routes.
These standards could be used in situations such as isolating low productivity
portions of otherwise productive routes or measuring options for bringing
unproductive routes into compliance with the overall service standards. These

4

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

The updating procedure will compare the values of the productivity standards
with those in effect for the previous year. Operating cost data for the previous
year will be revised to account for system-wide increases or decreases in
operating cost.

standards may also be used to evaluate proposals for new route extensions or
deviations on existing routes.

The RTD’s approach is to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety
of travel markets. All services are designed to match the level of service with
demand, thus improving performance and sustainability. This results in multiple
domains of acceptable performance for the various classes of service. Standards
are best set by first determining measures of performance and objectives. The
core objective is to maximize overall ridership, to the extent allowed by the
available resources.
Performance Objective
Service allocation is driven by the RTD adopted mission statement: “To meet our
constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District.”
Performance Measures
• Passengers/hour (productivity)
• Passengers/trip (productivity)
• Subsidy/passenger (cost effectiveness)
The subsidy per passenger measure combines fare revenue and total cost
impacts (refer to Appendix B for definitions) to produce a measure that
comprehensively reflects the District’s allocation of resources. The effectivenessproductivity chart presents economic effectiveness on the vertical axis, and
productivity, or boardings per hour, on the horizontal axis. The chart offers a
convenient comparative analysis of all classes of services, illustrating relative
performance. When standards and guidelines are applied, judgments can made.

Fixed Route Service Design and Evaluation Standards
1.

Minimum Service Frequency
New routes shall provide the minimum frequencies specified below. Existing
services that cannot meet these minimum standards while adhering to the
minimum passengers per hour or trip standards defined in Chapter II shall be
identified as candidates for service changes or appropriate marketing
promotion within available resources. These service changes may include
providing service with longer headways if no other viable alternative exists.
Elimination of the route may be considered if service changes and/or
promotional efforts do not improve productivity.
These are “policy” service levels and represent a compromise between
economic efficiency and the functionality of the system. To be sustained at
these levels, a route must meet the minimum ridership performance
standards discussed in Section II.C.2, and shown in Appendix A. Routes
providing frequencies higher than the policy minimum must be justified by
ridership demand as outlined in Section II.C.4.
The following table indicates the minimum frequency standard for types of
service and time of day.

1.B.3.b

Minimum Ridership Performance
This standard applies to routes operating at the minimum service frequency
target. For Local and Limited routes, the standard is passengers per hour
based upon the bottom 10% and 25% of routes in the respective class. For
Express, Regional, and skyRide routes, the standard is passengers per trip.
These standards are derived from system averages by class of service. All
routes must meet their applicable minimum standards. Those that do not
meet these standards will need to be modified or marketed in some way in
order to bring them up to the minimum standards. Those that are not
brought up to the minimum standards are subject to cancellation. Routes
that meet their applicable minimum ridership standards justify a service level
at the minimum service frequencies outlined in Section II.C.1. Higher
frequencies must be justified by ridership as outlined in Section II.C.4.
a. Performance Standards
Current performance standards are outlined in Appendix A.
b. Specific Trips
i. The standard for evaluating specific trips on a route varies by time of
day as shown in the following table. Trips must have boardings of at
least the specified percentage of the minimum boardings standard for the
time period of the trip, as defined in this table.
For Local or Limited routes,
the minimum boardings per
trip is derived by multiplying
the boardings per mile
standard by the length
(number of miles) of the
trip.

Time of Day for
Service Class

ii. On Express and Regional routes with more than three trips and which
provide only peak period service, the first and last trips must have
minimum boardings of one-half the service standard for the class of
service if the overall route meets the minimum boarding standard. If
boardings on the first or last trips are between 50 percent and 100
percent of the service standard, these trips may be candidates for
elimination, if there is alternative local service available.
iii. On Light Rail, the first trip of the operating day in each direction,
operated as the “Sweep Train”, is exempted from the minimum ridership
standards.

Service frequencies shall be adjusted so that the following maximum load
standards are met at least 60 percent of the time:
Local and Limited Service:
Peak periods – 125 percent of seated load on RTD's present bus fleet. The
maximum time that an individual passenger should be expected to stand on
a given trip is 15 minutes.
Off-peak periods - seated load
Express, Regional, and skyRide Service:
Seated load at all times.
Light Rail vehicles:
Peak periods - 125 passengers per vehicle
Off-peak periods - seated load
Special events – 165 passengers per vehicle
4. Demand Based Service Frequency
For routes meeting the above frequency, ridership, and load standards,
frequency better than every 30 minutes may be provided when and where
justified by ridership. This standard applies equally to all service categories.
In order to be sustainable, higher frequency service must meet the following
criteria:
•
•
•
•

Incremental frequency necessary to maintain the appropriate load standard
during any 30 minute time period.
Appropriate vehicle assignment as outlined in Section 5.
When a service exceeds the maximum load standard, higher frequency
may be justified during that time period and/or route segment.
If a service with better than the minimum frequency has passenger loads
that can be accommodated with a lower frequency without violating the
load standard, then frequency may be reduced.

Service frequency in the RTD network is based on ‘clock pattern’ schedules.
This pattern provides consistent and easy to understand schedules for our
customers, and makes possible the provision of timed transfer connection

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

3. Maximum Load Standard
For Local and Limited routes in the peak, the maximum load standard is
125% of a seated load at the maximum load point. For Local and Limited
routes outside of the peak, and for Express, Regional, and skyRide routes at
all times, the maximum load is the seated capacity of the vehicle.

Equipment shall be assigned to specific routes and trips according to the
following guidelines. These guidelines may be modified if operational and
scheduling needs require:
• Small 27’-30’ Bus: Appropriate for lower volume Local routes where
ridership does not require a standard bus, or for routes where specific
operating concerns preclude use of standard buses.
• Standard 40’ Transit Bus: The standard equipment for Local and Express
services. May also be used on Regional and skyRide trips in the Express
fare category.
• Articulated 60’ Bus: Appropriate for higher volume Limited and Express
services. May also be used on Regional and skyRide trips in the Express
fare category.
• Intercity Coach: Appropriate for Regional and skyRide services.

Design and Evaluation of Portions of Routes
The standards for evaluating portions of routes cover two areas in which
minor modifications may be made to routes without changing the overall
structure of the route:
•
•

midline segments or midline deviations
branches or end segments

The governing standards for overall route productivity were presented
earlier. Since trips provided during marginally productive hours of the day or
trips over marginal segments often increase the attractiveness of the overall
service, an otherwise productive route may be able to support some less
productive trips or portions of the route. However, if a route cannot meet

hubs, whereby multiple routes are scheduled to meet at one location to
facilitate connections. In general, routes are scheduled to operate in even
increments of 30 minutes, or every 60, 30, 15, 10, 7.5, or 5 minutes.
However, other frequencies may be provided depending upon passenger
demand, or operational and scheduling needs.

generate enough boardings per hour of service provided to meet the
standard for its class of service (CBD, Urban and Suburban). Boardings
in both directions will be counted.
ii. If a route is changed, the change shall not cause a reduction in the
overall boardings per hour for the route.
iii. If a route is changed, the change shall not cause the route to
violate any route design standards as defined in Chapter II, Section D,
or the overall productivity standards as defined in Chapter II.
b. Branches and End Segments
i.
A branch or end segment of a Local or Limited route should
generate enough boardings to meet the ridership standard for its class
of service (CBD, Urban and Suburban).
Boardings generated along the branch are defined as all passengers
boarding the bus along the branch or end portion of the route, and all
outbound passengers alighting along this section.
ii. Local collector portions of Express and Regional routes which meet
the following maximum travel time standard, shall meet the ridership
productivity standard for the entire route. This maximum travel time is
equal to 15 minutes or 50 percent of line haul travel time, whichever is
less.
For shorter segments, the minimum ridership standard is reduced by the
ratio of actual travel time to the maximum allowable travel time. Thus,
if the actual travel time along the collector is half of the maximum
allowed, it must average half the number of boardings per trip specified
in the minimum ridership productivity standard. Values of the ridership
productivity standards for Express and Regional routes are found in
Appendix A.

the overall service standards for its class of service, there may not be
productive segments to enhance the unproductive segments. Therefore,
specific segments, branches, or trips which meet the standards for portions
of routes may still be modified in order to raise the productivity of the entire
route, if the overall route does not meet the service standards for its class of
service.

iv. A route extension will not be initiated which violates any of the
route design standards found in Chapter II, Section D, or causes the
route as a whole to fall below the minimum riders per unit of service or
standards found earlier in Chapter II.
D. Non Fixed Route Service Design and Evaluation Standards
RTD continues to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel
markets. The goal of this approach is to match the type and level of service to the
demand in a given service area, thus improving performance and sustainability. As
such, a variety of non fixed route service alternatives are provided by the RTD. These
alternative services include the following:
1.

call-n-Ride Demand Responsive Service
Rather than operating on a fixed route according to a predetermined schedule,
demand responsive call-n-Ride service can be defined as a shared ride public
transportation service characterized by a defined geographic service area and the
need for the passenger to telephone to arrange for passenger pick-up and service.
A call-n-Ride service area for a single vehicle is generally between 4 and 10
square miles with 2 to 4 persons per acre and 1 to 3 employees per acre. call-nRide service often provides access to the broader RTD network of services
through timed connections at transfer centers and RTD park-n-Rides. Call-n-Ride
service is evaluated based on passenger boardings per revenue hour and subsidy
per passenger boarding. Refer to Appendix A for current standards.

2.

Vanpooling
Vanpooling is a public transportation option in which commuters/employees
whose residences are geographically clustered, ride together to and from their
work sites in a van that is driven by one of the vanpool participants. Typically
vanpools make one roundtrip per day and carry from five (5) to 14 riders.
Vanpooling offers greater opportunities for increased capacity compared to
carpooling and offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit in areas
of low employment density and longer commute distances. Vanpool service is
evaluated based on subsidy per passenger boarding. Refer to appendix A for
current standards.

3.

SeniorRide and Senior Shopper
RTD provides services to enhance the welfare of certain groups of persons such
as the current services offered for shopping and recreational trips for elderly

11

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

iii. A new extension to a route that does not meet the minimum
ridership productivity standard must attract sufficient ridership for the
entire route to meet the minimum ridership standard for its service
class.

November 2002

1.B.3.b

persons or persons with disabilities. Since SeniorRide and Senior Shopper
service are point to point services, these services are evaluated based on
passenger boardings per trip. Refer to Appendix A for current standards.

A. Directness of Route
Routes shall be designed to be as direct as possible and to provide maximum
accessibility to transit.
1.

Deviations from a direct path from end-to-end of the route shall account for
no more than one-quarter of the end-to-end travel time of the route.

2.

For a specific deviation, the total additional travel time for all through
passengers should not exceed three minutes for each rider boarding or
alighting along the deviation.
In mathematical terms, this means that the quantity
PT x VTT
PD

< 3 minutes

where:
PT = through passengers
VTT = additional vehicle one-way travel time
PD = passengers served by deviation
B.

Stop Spacing Standards
Bus routes shall adhere to the following stop spacing standards.
1. Minimum
• Local and Express collection, residential areas - 600'
(8 stops/mile)Commercial areas - 500' (10 stops/mile)
• Limited service, limited-stop zone - 2500' (2 stops/mile)
2. Maximum
• Local service, residential and commercial areas – 1,250’
(4 stops/mile)
• Limited service, residential and commercial areas – 1,250’
(4 stops/mile)
• Limited service, limited stop zone – 8,000’ (1 stop/1.5 miles)

C.

Roadway Design Goal
New bus routes should not be operated along streets that do not meet the
following minimum standards:
• Turning radius - 35' minimum
• Bus stop composition
• deep-strength asphalt:
7" for existing street
11" for new street
• concrete:
8.5" design thickness
8" existing thickness
• Street surface must be asphalt or concrete
• Lane width - 10' minimum
• No speed bumps
• Bridges - rated for H-20S loading (all legal weights)
• Shoulder width on rural roads - 6' minimum
• Overhead clearance - 12' minimum (16' 6" for structures on new
roads)

IV. AREA COVERAGE STANDARDS
A.

Purpose and Application
The purpose of these standards is to define a reasonable level of service to all
areas of the District and to help RTD maintain this service level. Since the RTD
service area includes many different types of development, and population
densities and land use vary widely across the District, it would not be reasonable
to expect all areas to support the same level of service. Moreover, different
types of service may best meet the needs of different areas, and RTD's resources
can be used in a more productive fashion if service can be tailored to the needs
of particular areas. Area coverage standards provide guidelines for tailoring
service to the needs of communities and help ensure that all areas receive a level
of service that is commensurate with their needs.
Levels of service for specific areas also depend on the productivity of existing
services. If existing or proposed services cannot meet the productivity standards
outlined in Chapter II, RTD may choose not to provide the minimum level of
service. Financial constraints may also limit RTD's ability to meet the area
coverage (or any other) standards.

B.

Coverage Levels Outside the Denver CBD
The area coverage standards for areas outside the Denver Central Business
District (CBD) are based on a combined density measure. This measure adds

population and employment to determine potential demand for transportation to
and from a particular area.

1. Minimum Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre:
• Peak period park-n-Ride service if either the travel time to the Denver CBD
by Express bus, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
• Local service on major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
• Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from park-n-Rides if
either the travel time to the Denver CBD by Express bus, or a bus/rail
timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.
2. Maximum Target Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre:
• Local service along major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
• Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from park-n- Rides if
travel time to the Denver CBD by Express bus exceeds 20 minutes.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
• Local service with ½ mile route spacing.
• Limited, Express, or Regional service if travel time to the Denver CBD by
Express bus exceeds 20 minutes.
V. SERVICE GUIDELINES FOR SPECIAL EVENTS AND SPECIAL SERVICES
A.

Derivation of Standards
The following guidelines for provision of bus and/or train service to special events
is based on prior RTD Board actions and on the public convenience and necessity
to:
1.

Protect neighborhoods from the impact of events which are so large as to
overwhelm the surrounding supply of parking, and

2.

Serve customers by offering adequate service for events which are
predictably large enough to overload the normally available transit service,
and

14

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

The area coverage standards presented below deal with minimum and maximum
route spacing. Actual route spacing and service frequency will depend on
demand and productivity of existing service in the area.

November 2002

Packet Pg. 110

1.B.3.b

3.
B.

Protect taxpayers by only serving those events that have a predictable level
of transit demand great enough to justify the operation of special routes.

Standards for Events

1.

For events at Invesco Field at Mile High with projected attendance of over
55,000, for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.

2.

For events at Coors Field with projected attendance of over 40,000, for
which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.

3.

At other venues where the ratio of projected attendance to available on-site
parking is 6:1 and for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one
time.

This service will not be provided when substantial numbers of the event patrons
can be expected to arrive in privately operated or non-profit owned buses.
RTD will provide Express Shuttle service to Invesco Field and Coors Field from
selected park-n-Rides for events described by Sections 1. and 2., above. The
General Manager must specifically authorize park-n-Ride service for other events.
RTD may also provide service at events with lower attendance projections if the
promoter is willing to subsidize such service. The RTD Board adopted a specific
subsidy formula in September 1987.
VI. SYSTEM-WIDE COST RECOVERY STANDARD
In 1989, the RTD Board of Directors adopted a system-wide minimum farebox
recovery ratio of 30 percent. This ratio is calculated by the following formula:

[ Farebox Revenues +
Advertising Revenues +
Lease Revenues +
FTA Operating Assistance +
Other Non-Sales Tax Revenues ]
[ Category I Costs +
Category II Costs +
Local share of depreciation on RTD assets]

15

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

RTD, within the limits of its budget, will operate special service:

November 2002

Packet Pg. 111

1.B.3.b

If the standard is not met, several courses of action may be taken. The RTD Board
has adopted a policy of evaluating the fare structure as part of the annual budget
process; fares may be changed at that time to provide additional revenue. RTD may
also choose to market its services more aggressively to attract more customers and
their fares, or RTD may look for revenue from other sources. The productivity
standards in Chapters II and III may be used to reduce the costs of providing service
while disrupting service to as few passengers as possible.
VII. STANDARD FOR SERVICE FOR TRANSIT DEPENDENT PERSONS AND TO SOCIAL
SERVICE DESTINATIONS
For purposes of these service standards, transit dependent riders are defined as riders
who either live in a household which does not own a car or who have a physical or
mental disability that prevents the transit patron from driving a car. Social Service
destinations are those destinations that are provided as a public service that may not
have consistently sufficient ridership to otherwise warrant the establishment or
continuation of a route or route segment. Examples of social service destinations
would include county court facilities, hospitals, schools, or public institutions which
have been situated or constructed in isolated locations prior to the establishment of
RTD or following review and comment by RTD of the proposed development plans of
such institution or agency, by the appropriate jurisdiction.
A. Purpose of the Standard
This standard is intended to provide for consideration of transit dependency in
service decisions. This standard does not guarantee a minimum level of service
to all transit-dependent riders. However, it will ensure that transit-dependent
riders and/or the need to have access to social service destinations are identified
and considered when decisions are made to reduce service levels in an area.
B. Determination of Transit Dependency
Whenever RTD plans changes to an existing route where there is no alternative
service available to meet the area coverage standards in Chapter IV, such as a
change in routing or span of service, transit-dependent riders will be identified
through on-board surveys. This survey will ask questions about riders' travel
habits and demographics, and it will attempt to identify transit-dependent riders
and their destinations.

16

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

The annual budget and six-year Transit Development Program (TDP) are evaluated
using this cost recovery standard.

November 2002

Packet Pg. 112

1.B.3.b

The applicable minimum productivity standards for a route will be reduced by
one-half the percentage of ridership that is defined as transit dependent. Thus, if
60 percent of the riders on a route are transit dependent, the route must achieve
70 percent [100 percent minus (60 percent divided by 2)] of the applicable
productivity standards (ridership and economic) in order not to be considered a
poor performer.
Applicable ridership standards for fixed route services may be found in Chapter II,
and for non-fixed route services, in Chapter III.
If the on-board survey reveals that the route does not serve the destinations
desired by transit-dependent riders, RTD may restructure the route to improve
service and increase ridership. This could include changing the routing or
schedule to serve passenger needs. RTD wishes to provide transit dependent
riders with service that fits their needs and to provide service to social service
destinations when there is even a modicum of recognized demand.
Another consideration to be given in whether or not to eliminate a route with
some transit dependent passengers is the impact on required paratransit services.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that eligible persons with
disabilities be provided with paratransit service if they have trip origins and
destinations within a defined service area three-fourths of a mile from a noncommuter fixed route. If accessible fixed route service is considered for removal
from a portion of the defined paratransit service area, an estimate of the demand
for substitute paratransit service for persons with disabilities who require liftequipped buses must be completed and a cost-benefit analysis performed for the
alternatives (leaving fixed route versus providing paratransit service).

Regional Transportation District

Service Performance 2010
Networked Family of Services

RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service development and
performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or demand? Should service
be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s general approach is as follows.
Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all the services together in a network or
system to accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match the level-of-service with demand, thus
improving performance and sustainability.

RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to help
make judgments about performance. Each rectangle
labeled by service type represents the domain for routes
that meet or exceed minimum performance requirements
for that service class. Minimums are defined statistically
to represent routes meeting or exceeding 10% of the
performance for all routes in each category. So this is a
case where it’s bad to be “outside the box.”

Subsidy per Boarding or Effectiveness

Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures
attainment of the objective – maximize ridership within
the budget - and is presented on the y-axis as subsidy
per boarding. Efficiency - productivity or output

divided by input - is presented on the x-axis as

boardings/vehicle hour. The charts offer a convenient,
Same boardings,

comparative analysis of all classes of services, illustrating
both absolute and relative performance.
Better

Same subsidy,
more boardings

Boardings per Vehicle Hour or Productivity

Higher

Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak
periods and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership significantly
exceeds the minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange, dotted, vertical line at
25 boardings per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to justify 15-minute frequency,
and the green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.
Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues, boardings and
costs - both operating and amortized capital – are included. For complete, detailed information see RTD’s
Service Standards (under Resources).

Overview

• Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
• Hours: In-service, vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
• Fare Revenues: Cash, ticket, & tokens allocated by route by farebox recorded boardings. Monthly pass
revenues are allocated by class of pass and the number of uses by route. Revenue from Eco, CU, and Auraria

passes are allocated individually by the counts for each route weighted by the ratio of the class of service fare
to the local fare.
• Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus depreciation on
all RTD assets. Excludes interest and any costs attributed to future projects. RTD’s cost allocation model
allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak vehicles. Individual accounting line items
are assigned to the most relevant variable by the model.
• Subsidy: Costs - Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Service Standards that the least productive 10% of routes based on
either subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for marketing, revision or elimination,
or if both measures fall below 25% for a route. The performance charts illustrate the acceptable performance
domain containing all routes meeting the 10% minimums for each class of service. The calculation of the 10% and
25% standards are made from the annual, un-weighted data, assuming the data have a normal distribution
and using the appropriate formulas for standard deviation and confidence intervals; however, the standard
deviation is applied to the weighted average. The following table gives the current year weighted averages
and standards by class of service.

Regional Transportation District

Over the last decade RTD has introduced new Light Rail lines, made significant adjustments to services and
been subject to wide swings in economic conditions. The following is a look back at our two principal
performance indicators: subsidy per boarding – getting the most riders for our budget dollar; and boardings
per hour – getting the most riders for our resource input. Performance expectations are different for each
service class, so there are multiple trend lines (note whether the left- or right-hand scale is used).

Some highlights include the following. While some Metro (Express, Regional and skyRide) services were
discontinued with the opening of the SW Corridor, the most significant reduction of Express services occurred
for the SE Corridor. Light Rail unit cost (and therefore subsidy per boarding) increased in the middle years most
likely due to adding a maintenance facility, aging cars, improved security and operator training for the SE
Corridor. Mall ridership declined in part due to riders switching to F- and H-Lines from Expresses terminating
at the Civic Center and Market Street bus stations. New call-n-Rides in more productive service areas
(including the SE Corridor) fueled ridership growth until the recession. The latest recession combined with fare
increases caused ridership to wane; although higher gas prices induce ridership, especially on Metro services.
However RTD adjusted its service levels to maintain consistent performance.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain

Route 2 East 1st Ave. — Saturday and Sunday service was discontinued and weekday early and late trips
discontinued in May 2009. Midday service was discontinued in August 2010. This was the worst
performing CBD Local route in 2010. Propose to discontinue route.
Route 3 Ltd East Alameda — This is a well utilized route that easily meets the boardings per hour standard.
However, its subsidy per boarding is higher than most other CBD Local routes because the 3Ltd is a peak
period, peak direction only service and is thus more expensive to operate. Propose to consolidate 2 AM and
2 PM trips.
Route 32 West 32nd Ave/City Park — This route dipped below the subsidy standard for the second time in
2010 and just meets the boarding per hour standard. Propose to discontinue route east of downtown and
discontinue west of downtown after 8 pm due to poor performance on these segments.
Route 34 West 3rd Avenue Commuter —This is a small route that has been restructured several times in recent
years and serves passengers with disabilities. It will be investigated for additional changes or
discontinuance.
Route 44Ltd 44th Ave — This route did not meet the standards for boardings per hour or subsidy per boarding
in 2010. Propose to discontinue route.
Route 45 Montbello/Green Valley Ranch — This route is misclassified and will be changed to Suburban Local
next year. It meets all standards for this class.
Routes 47X Green Valley Ranch/Montbello Express — This route did not meet the standards for boardings per
hour or subsidy per boarding in 2010. It is proposed to combine this route with the Route 48X Green Valley
Ranch Express for improved performance overall.
Route 54 Montbello Industrial Park — This is a small route operated from an interline. Propose to discontinue
off-peak service.
Route 60 South Pierce — This is a small feeder route to the SW Corridor that serves passengers with
disabilities. In May, 2008 3 of its 8 trips were discontinued. Propose to discontinue route and replace with
new call-n-Ride.
Route 63X Lockheed/Waterton — For the SE Corridor Service Plan this route was truncated to operate
between Mineral LRT station and Lockheed Martin peak trips only. Both ridership and performance are the
worst of any Express service, despite efforts working with the employer to increase ridership. Propose to
discontinue route and replace with new call-n-Ride and encourage vanpooling.
Route 67 Coal Mine / Ridge Rd Crosstown — Performance has continued to be below standards for several
years. Propose to discontinue route and replace with new call-n-Ride.

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

The following provides status as of August 2011, listed in route number order.

Route 77 Dry Creek/Ken Caryl Crosstown — Performance has continued to be below standards for several
years. Propose to discontinue service from Mineral Station to Arapahoe Station. The portion west of the
station will remain in conjunction with new call-n-Ride.

Route 79 East Florida Ave — This route was established with the opening of the Southeast Corridor in
November 2006. The segment of the route north of University Station was discontinued in May 2009 and
frequency reduced in 2011. Propose to discontinue route, which is in part duplicated by Route 79Ltd.

Route 327 Northside Loop Counterclockwise — Service frequency was reduced August 2008; the first morning
trip was discontinued August 210. Propose to discontinue first AM trip.
Route 401 Ranches Crosstown —Propose to discontinue the portion of the route west of Mineral Station on
weekends and replace with new call-n-Ride.
Route 403 Lucent Blvd — This route does not meet service standards. No proposed changes at this time due to
other proposed reductions in the general service area.
Route 410 Franktown/Parker — This route was substantially revised with the reinstatement of Route P
Parker/Denver spring 2007. Service was reduced to every 30 minutes peak and every two hours midday.
Service was reduced to peak period only May 2009. No proposed changes at this time due to other
proposed reductions in the general service area.
Route DD Boulder/Colorado Blvd —3 morning and afternoon trips were discontinued August 2010 due to
declining ridership from the University Hospital move to Anshutz-Fitzsimons Medical Center. Propose to
discontinue route.
Route EV —Propose to discontinue several trips.
Route T Boulder/Greenwood Plaza — This route was discontinued November 2006 with the opening of the
Southeast Corridor. Responding to customer complaints, the RTD Board reinstated the route in March
2007. This route will be revisited when Union Station construction provides the needed bus-rail
connections.
Evergreen call-n-Ride — Propose to discontinue last hour of service.
Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride — Span of service was reduced to 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM and Saturday service
discontinued August, 2008. In May 2009 this service was proposed to be discontinued; however, further
analysis found that ADA eligible riders would result in a net increase in cost if their rides were
accommodated on access-a-Ride.
Superior call-n-Ride — Due to declining ridership, propose to discontinue service.
Parker call-n-Ride — Weekday span of service was reduced to 5:30 AM - 6:00 PM and Saturday service
discontinued August, 2008. Propose to discontinue service.

HIGHLIGHTS
The 2008 RTD Bus Customer Satisfaction Survey was conducted with an on-board survey of 2,814 riders selected
randomly from five types of bus service: Denver Local, Boulder Local, Longmont Local, Express and Regional. Key
findings from the survey include:

EVALUATION OF SERVICE
 Bus riders continue to express relatively high satisfaction with service. In 2008, more than eight out of ten bus riders
(86%) rated overall service as either good (52%) or excellent (34%). Only 12% of all riders rated service as fair,
while 3% rated it as either poor or very poor.
 Overall satisfaction with RTD bus service did not vary significantly by type of service, time period or county of
residence.
 In 2008, five bus performance categories received average ratings of good or better: bus driver performance, parkn-Rides, web site, security, and Telephone Information Center. Rated, on average, slightly below good were
convenience, customer information, pricing/fares, travel time and comfort. Rated lowest between fair and good
was traveling with bicycles.
 The largest segment of bus riders identified pricing/fares (31%) as being most in need of improvement. Other
performance categories identified by relatively large percentages of bus riders included: convenience (19%) and
travel time (12%).

TRIP CHARACTERISTICS
 Work commuters account for seven out of ten (70%) of all bus passengers. While the largest segment of work
commuters travel to Downtown Denver (14% of all riders), the vast majority of work commuters are traveling to
numerous locations spread throughout the Denver Metro Area (56% of all riders). Three out of ten bus riders (30%)
rode RTD for non-work trips such as personal business (10%), school (6%), medical appointments (5%),
shopping/eating out (4%), social/recreational (4%) and other (1%).
 The majority of all bus passengers (62%) continue to pay their fare with a form of prepayment – primarily by monthly
pass/ValuPass (26%), Eco Pass (13%) and 10-Ride Ticketbook (12%). Prepaid fares are far more likely to be used on
Express (95%), Regional (84%) and Boulder Local (74%) service than on Denver Local (57%) or Longmont Local
(50%) service. Cash was used to pay fares by 37% of all bus riders.
 In 2005, 19% of the bus riders used a special fare discount: disabled (9%), seniors (6%) and student/19 and under
(4%).
 Eight out of ten bus riders (80%) walked to their first bus stop, while 7% drove and parked, 3% were dropped off, 4%
bicycled, 2% transferred from light rail, 2% transferred from the 16th Street Mall and 1% transferred from call-n-Ride.
 Bus riders indicated that their total trip distance (total one-way distance between origin and final destination) averaged
11.9 miles. The average total trip time was estimated at 40.9 minutes.
 The majority of bus riders (58%) made at least one transfer to another bus for their trip.

 Substantial percentages of bus riders used the 16th Street Mall Shuttle (17%) and/or light rail (22%) for a portion of
their trip.
 Nearly one out of ten (9%) of all bus riders parked at an RTD park-n-Ride for their bus trip. park-n-Ride use was
significantly higher among Regional (60%) and Express (37%) riders.
 In 2008, bus passengers had taken, on average, 6.0 one-way rides on an RTD bus during the past week.
 New riders (those who had been riding RTD for less than one year) accounted for 20% of all bus riders. “Choice”
riders were more likely than “captive” (transit dependent) riders to be new riders (25% vs. 16%).

RIDER CHARACTERISTICS
 While RTD bus riders represent all demographic and socio-economic segments in the Denver metropolitan area, as a
whole, bus riders are more likely than all Denver Metro Area adults to be female, single, transit dependent, an ethnic
minority, have lower household incomes and live in Denver County.
 The Express and Regional riders, as a whole, have very different demographic characteristics than the Denver Local,
Boulder Local and Longmont Local riders. The Express and Regional riders are more likely than the local service
riders to be older, married, have higher education, have higher household incomes, be employed in professional
occupations and be choice riders.
 The majority of all bus riders (56%) are classified as “captive” or transit dependent. “Captive” riders are defined as
those who do not have a car available at the time they ride RTD or have a physical/mental disability that prevents them
from driving a car. “Choice” riders (those who have a car available and are able to drive it) account for 44% of all bus
passengers.
 While Hispanics represent an increasing segment of bus riders (18% in 2008), only 3% of all bus passengers spoke
Spanish and also had difficulty with English.
 Three out of ten bus riders (30%) had ridden light rail within the past week, while the majority (55%) had ridden light
rail at least once in the past 12 months.

 In 2008, more than three out of four bus riders (77%) had used one or more of RTD’s special services within the past
12 months. They were most likely to have used the 16th Street Mall Shuttle (59%) and skyRide (18%).
 The majority of all bus riders (54%) had used RTD’s web site within the past 30 days to use the trip planner (40%)
and/or obtain other information (34%).
 Consistent with the high percentage of transit dependent bus riders, “no car available/do not drive” was cited as the
most important reason for riding RTD by slightly more than one-half of the bus riders (51%). “Cheaper than driving”
was the most important reason for 21% of the bus riders.

MAJOR CHANGES SINCE 1998
 Overall satisfaction with RTD bus service has improved since 1998. The most significant improvement was the
percentage of bus riders who rated overall bus service as excellent (23% in 1998 to 34% in 2008).
 The composite ratings for two bus service performance categories have improved since 1998: park-n-Rides and
convenience, while the composite ratings for two performance categories have declined: customer information and
pricing/fares.
 Since 1998, pricing/fares has emerged as the one area that bus riders identify as being most in need of improvement
(from 6% in 1998 to 31% in 2008), while convenience (25% to 19%) and travel time (19% to 12%) have
significantly declined as being most in need of improvement. This trend reflects the frequent changes in fare structure
during this period.

 While a small number of service dimensions declined slightly, none declined significantly since 1998. There were four
specific service dimensions that have shown significant improvement in their average ratings between 1998 and 2008.
The average ratings are based on a scale of 1.0 (very poor) to 5.0 (excellent).

 The percentage (not numerical) of all bus riders who commute to/from work in Downtown Denver has decreased from
19% in 1998 to 14% in 2008.
 Bus riders using light rail for a portion of their trip doubled from 11% in 1998 to 22% in 2008 – due to the continued
expansion of the light rail system.
 Use of some form of prepayment for fares has increased between 1998 and 2008 (56% to 62%), while use of cash has
declined (43% to 37%). The largest change in a specific type of fare payment between 1998 and 2008 was in the
growth of Eco Pass (8% to 13%).
 In 2008, a larger percentage of bus riders (25%) were occasional riders (they had taken no bus trips in the week prior
to the trip on which they were surveyed) compared to 1998 (16%). This resulted in a decrease in the weekly ridership
frequency between 1998 and 2008 (7.3 one-way trips to 6.0 one-way trips).
 Due to the decline in the percentage of bus riders who commute to/from work in Downtown Denver, the percentage of
bus riders who had used the 16th Street Mall Shuttle within the past 12 months also declined between 1998 (67%) and
2008 (59%).

I. INTRODUCTION
The Regional Transportation District’s (RTD’s) commitment to customers includes the goal of meeting present and future
public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service. In order to assess
how well the service level delivered matches customer expectations, RTD conducted on-board surveys of bus, light rail,
call-n-Ride and skyRide riders. The benefits of conducting customer satisfaction studies and implementing required
service improvements include:
-

Higher customer retention
Increased referrals
Higher ridership
Greater efficiency
Increased farebox revenue
Enhanced public image and support

The 2008 Bus Customer Satisfaction Survey questionnaire was developed jointly by RTD’s Market Research Department
and The Howell Research Group. RTD was responsible for the distribution and collection of the questionnaires, while The
Howell Research Group was responsible for the tabulation and analysis of the survey results. This report presents the
overall findings from the 2008 Bus Customer Satisfaction Survey. The RTD Board members and the planning,
operations, marketing and customer services staff should find this report a vital resource.

OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of the 2008 Bus Customer Satisfaction Survey were to determine:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Trip characteristics of bus riders.
Satisfaction with using RTD based on critical performance attributes.
Priorities for possible corrective actions or improvements in RTD service.
Trends in rider profiles and satisfaction via a comparison of 2008 results with 1998 and 2005 results.
Demographic profiles of key rider segments by type of service, peak/non-peak boardings, form of payment and
types of trips.
Identification of language barriers among riders.

II. METHODOLOGY
QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT
Customer satisfaction was measured by asking bus riders to rate RTD’s performance based on their recent trip
experience. A set of critical performance attributes was identified from several different sources:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

RTD Customer Panel
RTD customer complaints and comments
Previously conducted on-board surveys of RTD customers
Input from RTD’s marketing personnel
Input from RTD department heads
Customer satisfaction studies conducted by other transit agencies

The questionnaire used for the 2008 Bus Customer Satisfaction Survey is presented in Appendix A.

SAMPLING
The 2008 Bus Customer Satisfaction Survey was conducted with a self-administered, on-board survey of randomly
selected weekday RTD passengers. In order to ensure adequate sample sizes of riders by type of service used, a quota
sample by type of service – Denver Local, Boulder Local, Longmont Local, Express and Regional – was employed. A
determination of total sample size by type of service was made, in part, by selecting sample sizes sufficient to ensure a
minimum return of approximately 200 per service type in order to meet acceptable margins of error, and also by selecting
sample sizes that were somewhat proportional by the average number of weekday passenger boardings per service type.
Due to the relatively small number of boardings, the desired quota for Longmont Local was set at 100.
In addition, the quota sample for each service type was divided into separate and distinct sub-populations or strata. Each
stratum represented a route. Allocation of the quota samples among various routes was made proportional to the number
of weekday passenger boardings that comprised all of the routes within a service type. Each route sample was then

Based on the sample stratification used for the study, bus drivers were instructed to randomly distribute questionnaire
packets to riders on the routes, runs, and timeframes specified on each survey packet. Each survey packet consisted of a
cover letter (included on questionnaire) explaining the purpose of the survey, the questionnaire, a pencil, coupons for two
free rides, and a postage-paid return envelope. A portion of the self-administered questionnaires was completed by riders
on-board and returned to the bus drivers who forwarded them on to RTD’s Market Research Department.
The survey questionnaire was available in Spanish for those who felt more comfortable completing a Spanish version. In
total, 86 bus passengers completed Spanish questionnaires.
In order to ensure a good response rate, respondents could enter a drawing for one of 20 $50 King Soopers gift
certificates.
The questionnaires were distributed during the weekday peak and off-peak hours between November 10 and 13, 2008. A
total of 5,986 survey packets were distributed by bus drivers. Of the total survey packets distributed among RTD bus
riders, 2,814 were completed and returned – a significantly high response rate of 47.0%.

DATA WEIGHTING
As the sample was initially designed as a quota sample by type of service, the bus data was weighted for analysis
purposes to reflect accurately the proportion of a service type’s ridership and peak/off-peak boardings within the entire
system. For example, actual boarding data shows that 26% of the bus boardings were on a Denver Local during the peak
hours, but 28% of the completed surveys were from Denver Local riders during peak hours. Thus, the survey data for this
service type and time period was weighted down to reflect 26% of the data. The specific weighting factors for the 2008
Bus Customer Satisfaction Survey are presented in Appendix B.

III. TRIP CHARACTERISTICS
This section presents trends in the trip behavior of RTD bus riders. It illustrates trends in the following critical areas that
affect the ridership, revenue and performance of the transit system:
Purpose of transit trip
Method of fare payment
Rider access to bus
Length of trips
Transfers/use of other RTD services for trip
Ridership frequency
New riders

TRIP PURPOSE
Commuting to or from work is the most prevalent trip purpose among bus riders. In 2008,
seven out of ten bus riders (70%) rode RTD for commuting to/from work. Work commuters
were divided between those who worked in Downtown Denver (14% of all riders) or other
places (56%). The typical work commuter made an average of 6.2 one-way bus trips per
week.
Three out of ten bus riders (30%) rode RTD for non-work trips such as personal business
(10%), school (6%), medical appointments (5%), shopping/eating out (4%) and
social/recreational (4%). (Refer to Figure 1 and Table 1).
The percentage of bus riders commuting to/from work has not changed significantly since
1998. However, the percentage of riders commuting to/from work in Downtown Denver
has decreased from 19% in 1998 to 14% in 2008 primarily due to replacing many of the
Express bus routes with Local bus service to light rail stations.
Trip purpose varies significantly by type of service. The vast majority of Express (94%)
and Regional (80%) passengers are riding RTD bus service to/from work, while 70% of the

Denver Local bus riders are commuting to/from work. More than one-half of the Boulder Local (57%) and less than onehalf of Longmont Local (41%) passengers are riding RTD to/from work. The Boulder Local (10%) and Longmont Local
(13%) routes had higher percentages of school/college riders than the other types of bus service. A relatively high
percentage of Longmont Local riders took trips for shopping/eating out (14%).

METHOD OF FARE PAYMENT
The majority of all bus passengers (62%) pay their fare with a form of prepayment – primarily
by monthly pass/ValuPass (26%), Eco Pass (13%) and 10-Ride Ticketbook (12%). Cash fares
have declined between 1998 (43%) and 2008 (37%). In 2008, the use of some form of
prepayment was higher (62%) than in 1998 (56%) and 2005 (59%). The largest change in
type of fare payment between 1998 and 2008 was in the use of Eco Pass (8% to 13%). (Refer
to Figure 2 and Table 2.)
The method of fare payment varies significantly by type of bus service. Prepaid fares were most likely used by Express
(95%), Regional (84%) and Boulder Local (74%) riders. Boulder Local riders were more likely to have paid their fare by
College Student Pass (10%) than riders on other types of service. Riders using Boulder Local (36%), Express (35%) and
Regional (29%) bus service were more likely than other riders to have paid their fare by Eco Pass.

In 2008, 19% of the bus riders used a special fare discount: disabled (9%), seniors (6%) and students/19 and under
(4%).1 Use of special fare discounts was most prevalent among Longmont Local riders (37%) and least prevalent among
Express (5%) and Regional (10%) riders. Use of special fare discounts was not significantly different in 2008 (19%)
compared to 1998 (18%) and 2005 (16%). (Refer to Table 2 and Figure 3.)

HOW RIDERS ACCESSED FIRST BUS
In 2008, eight out of ten bus riders (80%) walk to their first bus stop, while 7% drove and parked,
3% were dropped off, 4% bicycled, 3% transferred from light rail, 1% transferred from call-n-Ride
and 2% transferred from the 16th Street Mall Shuttle. (Refer to Table 3.)
Riders’ access to their first bus differs significantly by type of service. The vast majority of Denver
Local (84%), Boulder Local (86%) and Longmont Local (98%) riders walked to their first bus stop,
while only 31% of the Express and 47% of the Regional riders walked. Large percentages of
Express (49%) and Regional (28%) riders drove and parked.
Access to first bus stop was essentially the same in both 2005 and 2008. This question was not asked in 1998.
The majority of bus riders (55%) travel under one-fourth of a mile from their starting point to where they boarded their first
bus. In total, 81% of the bus riders travel one mile or less to board their first bus. As expected, Express and Regional
riders, on average, travel further to board their first bus. Express (53%) and Regional (40%) riders were far more likely to
travel more than one mile than Denver Local (18%), Boulder Local (19%) or Longmont Local (17%) riders.
Two-thirds of the bus riders who walk to their bus stop (67%) walk under one-fourth of a mile. The vast majority of riders
who drive to their bus stop and park (79%) drive more than one mile (57% drive 1-5 miles). Bus riders who are driven to
and dropped off at their bus stop were more likely to have traveled less than one mile (60%) than to have traveled one
mile or more (40%).
The distances traveled to reach the first bus stop were very similar in both 2005 and 2008.

LENGTH OF TRIPS
Bus riders were asked to indicate the length of their total trip in both miles (total one-way distance
between origin and final destination) and minutes (total time between origin and final destination).
In 2008, the average trip distance for all bus riders was 11.9 miles. As expected, Regional riders
had a significantly longer average trip distance (25.9 miles) than Express (15.6 miles), Denver Local
(10.7 miles), Boulder Local (8.1 miles) and Longmont Local (7.3 miles) riders. (Refer to Figure 4.)
The average trip length for bus riders in 2008 (11.9 miles) was essentially the same as the average
trip length in 2005 (12.0 miles).

In 2008, the average trip time for all bus riders was 40.9 minutes. Although Regional riders had an average trip distance
more than twice the other types of service, their average trip time (55.5 minutes) was only moderately longer than other
types of bus service. This is due to faster travel speeds of Regional buses and the lower number of transfers required of
Regional riders. Since the routes are relatively shorter, the shortest travel times were reported by Boulder Local (26.9
minutes) and Longmont Local (35.5 minutes) riders. The average travel time for Express and Denver Local riders were
37.0 minutes and 41.6 minutes respectively. (Refer to Figure 5.)
The average trip time reported by bus riders in 2008 (40.9 minutes) was shorter than the average trip time in 2005 (42.0
minutes).

TRANSFER FREQUENCY & USE OF OTHER RTD SERVICES
In 2008, the majority of bus riders (56%) made one or more bus transfers during their total trip.
Denver Local (60%) and Longmont Local (58%) riders were most likely to make transfers, while
Express (22%) and Regional (37%) riders were the least likely to make transfers. The percentage of
riders making transfers will be overstated in the survey results since the sample design was based
on passenger boardings and not on passenger trips. The percentage of bus riders making one or
more bus transfers in 2008 was the same as in 2005 (56%) and slightly higher than in 1998 (51%).
(Refer to Table 4.)
Substantial percentages of bus riders used light rail (22%) and the 16th Street Mall Shuttle (17%) for
a portion of their trips. Small percentages of bus riders used skyRide (2%) and call-n-Ride (2%) for a
portion of their trips.
Use of light rail among bus riders for a portion of their trips has steadily increased from 11% in 1998 to 16% in 2005 to
22% in 2008. This increase can be attributed to the continued expansion of the light rail system: Southwest Light Rail line
(2000), Central Platte Valley Light Rail extension (2002) and Southeast Light Rail line (2007).
Use of light rail for a portion of their trips was highest among Denver Local (26%) and Express (14%) riders. Use of the
16th Street Mall Shuttle was highest among Express (37%) and Regional (25%) riders because many of these routes
begin or terminate at the Civic Center and Market Street stations, which are located on the 16 th Street Mall in Downtown
Denver. Use of call-n-Ride was highest among Longmont Local (12%) riders.
One out of ten bus riders (11%) parked at an RTD park-n-Ride for their bus trip. Significantly higher percentages of
Express (60%) and Regional (37%) riders parked at a park-n-Ride than riders of other types of bus service. Those using
a park-n-Ride traveled an average of 4.5 miles between their home and the park-n-Ride.

In 2008, bus passengers had taken, on average, 6.0 one-way trips on an RTD bus during the past
week. One-fourth of the bus riders (25%) were only occasional riders meaning that they had
taken no bus trips in the past week prior to the trip on which they were surveyed. Trip purpose for
occasional riders was essentially the same as the trip purpose for the more frequent riders.
Average ridership frequency has declined from 7.3 one-way trips in 1998 to 6.0 one-way trips in
2008. (Refer to Figure 6.)

Trip frequency varied by the type
of bus service. In 2008, Regional
riders (6.8 trips) had the highest
average weekly frequency, while
Express riders (5.3 trips) had the
lowest. Ridership frequencies for
the riders of local services were
similar: Boulder Local (6.2),
Longmont Local (6.1) and Denver
Local (6.0). (Refer to Figure 7.)

prepayment were more frequent
riders (6.6 one-way trips/past
week) than riders who paid by cash only (5.2). Ridership frequency was highest among those who paid their fares by
monthly pass/ValuPass (7.2) and Neighborhood Eco Pass (7.0).

Since the Bus Customer Satisfaction Survey sampling is based on boardings, someone who rides more frequently has a
better chance of being surveyed than someone who rides less frequently. Thus, the ridership frequencies presented
above overestimate the average frequency of all persons who might ride the bus during a given period of time. An
alternative method, called the “harmonic mean” adjusts for the lower probability of less frequent riders being sampled.
Calculating ridership frequency using the harmonic mean results in an average of 4.9 one-way bus trips in the past week
among all bus riders. This is a significantly lower frequency than was calculated using a straight arithmetic mean.

NEW RIDERS
New riders are those who have been riding RTD for less than one year. New riders accounted for 20%
of all bus riders in 2008. The percentage of new riders was higher in 2008 than in 1998 (15%) and
slightly lower than in 2005 (22%). In 2008, new riders were more likely to be found on the Longmont
Local (30%) than on Express (25%), Regional (23%), Boulder Local (21%) or Denver Local (19%)
routes. (Refer to Figure 8.)
The demographic characteristics of new bus riders were generally consistent with the demographics of
previous riders except for age. New riders were more likely than previous riders to be under 35 years of
age (39% vs. 21%).

IV. RIDER EVALUATION OF BUS SERVICE
Bus riders were asked to evaluate RTD bus service on 43 separate dimensions in 11 different performance categories.
These measures reflect the kinds of decisions potential and existing passengers make, consciously or not, when deciding
whether to use transit or another mode, usually the private automobile.
The ratings were conducted using a five-point narrative scale comprised of very poor, poor, fair, good and excellent.
Mean scores have been calculated for these ratings by assigning integer values of “1” to very poor, “2” to poor, “3” to
fair, “4” to good, “5” to excellent and disregarding the no opinions.

OVERALL RATING OF RTD BUS SERVICE
RTD bus riders gave high ratings to overall bus service. In 2008, more than eight out of ten bus riders
(86%) rated the service as either excellent (34%) or good (52%). Only 12% of the riders rated bus
service as fair, while 3% rated it as either poor or very poor. (Refer to Figure 9 and Table 5.)
Overall satisfaction with RTD bus service has improved since 1998. While a slightly higher percentage
of riders in 2008 (86%) than in 1998 (81%) and 2005 (84%) rated overall service as either excellent or
good, those rating bus service as excellent increased significantly from 23% in 1998 to 34% in 2008. The
percentage of respondents who rated service as either poor or very poor was extremely small in each of the three
surveys.
Overall bus service was rated higher by peak hour riders (4.3) than off-peak riders (4.1).

 Overall Rating of Bus Service by Service Type
The mean ratings of overall bus service varied slightly by type of service, but the mean rating for each type of service was
good or better. Passengers who rode Boulder Local (4.3), Express (4.3) and Regional (4.2) routes rated overall bus
service slightly better than those who rode Denver Local (4.1) and Longmont Local (4.0) routes. (Refer to Table 5 and
Figure 10.)
All service types showed improvements in overall service ratings since 1998. The largest improvement was for Express
service (4.0 in 1998 to 4.3 in 2008).

 Overall Rating of Bus Service by County of Residence
In 2008, overall bus service ratings varied slightly by county of residence. Bus riders in all counties rated overall bus
service, on average, as good or better. Boulder County (4.3) and Broomfield County (4.3) riders gave slightly higher
ratings to bus service than Arapahoe County (4.2), Douglas County (4.2), Jefferson County (4.2), Denver County (4.1)
and Adams County (4.0) riders. (Refer to Figure 11.)
Ratings of overall bus service by county of residence have either remained the same or improved slightly since 1998.

COMPOSITE RATINGS OF BUS PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES
A composite rating was calculated for each performance category by averaging the mean score ratings (1 – 5) for all of
the separate dimensions rated in the performance category. Similar to previous years, the 2008 bus riders gave their
highest composite ratings to bus driver performance (4.4). (Refer to Figure 12.)
Other performance categories receiving composite ratings of good or better were: park-n-Rides (4.1), web site (4.1),
security (4.1) and Telephone Information Center (4.0). Performance categories that received composite ratings slightly
below good in 2008 were: convenience (3.9), customer information (3.8), pricing/fares (3.8), travel time (3.8) and
comfort (3.7). Receiving the lowest composite rating was traveling with bicycles (3.5) with a rating between fair and
good.
There were some variances in the composite ratings between 1998 and 2008. The composite ratings for three
performance categories improved between 1998 and 2008: bus driver performance (4.3 to 4.4), park-n-Rides (3.9 to
4.1) and convenience (3.7 to 3.9). Two performance categories declined between 1998 and 2008: customer
information (4.1 to 3.8) and pricing/fares (3.9 to 3.8).

 Bus Driver Performance
The most highly rated service performance category was bus driver performance. Two
bus driver performance service dimensions received ratings approaching excellent: courtesy
(4.5) and driving skills (4.5). The other service dimensions were rated, on average, better
than good: knowledge of their specific routes (4.4), ability to answer questions about bus
service (4.3) and announcing transfer stops (4.1). (Refer to Figure 13 and Table 6.)
Since 1998, the bus driver performance service dimensions have been rated the same or
slightly higher.

 park-n-Rides
In 2008, nearly one out of ten (9%) bus riders had parked their cars at a park-n-Ride on the day
of the survey. These respondents rated all park-n-Ride service dimensions good or better.
Rated, on average, better than good were: feeling of personal safety (4.2) and cleanliness of
passenger shelters (4.1), while security of parked car (4.0) and availability of parking spaces
(4.0) were rated good. (Refer to Figure 14 and Table 7.)
Bus riders who use park-n-Rides were more likely than other bus riders to be work commuters
(87% vs. 67%), “choice” riders (90% vs. 40%) and pay their fare with a form of prepayment (89% vs. 59%). The average
distance traveled from a bus rider’s home to a park-n-Ride was 4.5 miles.
Ratings for three of the park-n-Ride service dimensions have steadily improved between 1998 and 2008: feeling of
personal safety (4.0 to 4.2), cleanliness of passenger shelters (3.8 to 4.1) and security of parked car (3.8 to 4.0).
Availability of parking spaces had significantly improved from 3.9 to 4.3 between 1998 and 2005, then significantly
declined to 4.0 in 2008.

Bus riders were asked to rate RTD’s web site regarding the trip planner and obtaining other
information. Four out of ten bus passengers (40%) said they used the trip planner on RTD’s web
site within the past 30 days. Those that had used the web site trip planner (an average of 5.2 times
in past 30 days) rated accuracy of information (4.1) and ease of use (4.1) slightly better than good.
The ratings for both web site trip planner service dimensions were rated the same in 2005 and 2008.
(Refer to Figure 15 and Table 8.)
A smaller percentage of bus riders (34%) had used RTD’s web site for information other than the
trip planner within the past 30 days. These riders rated web site information other than the trip
planner (4.1) slightly better than good.

 Telephone Information Center
In 2008, 43% of the bus passengers had called RTD’s Telephone Information Center (TIC)
within the past 30 days. These riders had called the TIC an average of 5.4 times during this
period. The vast majority of bus riders who had used RTD’s TIC (81%) had interfaced only with a
live operator, while 10% had used only the automated, touch-tone system and 9% had used both a
live operator and the automated system.
There was wide variance in the ratings given to TIC service dimensions. Rated better than good
were courtesy of TIC operator (4.3) and accuracy of TIC information (4.1). Rated below good were
ease of using RTD’s automated touch-tone system (3.8) and ease of reaching live TIC operator
(3.6). (Refer to Figure 17 and Table 10.)
Three service dimensions: courtesy of TIC operator, accuracy of TIC information and ease of using automated touch tone
system were rated slightly higher in 2005 than 1998 and then were rated the same in 2008. Ease of reaching a live TIC
operator was rated lower in 2008 (3.6) than in 2005 (3.8).

The service dimensions for convenience had the widest variance in mean score ratings. Rated better than good were
closeness of bus stop to final destination (4.3), closeness of bus stop to home (4.3) and service to areas you want to go
(4.1). Rated slightly below good was closeness of park-n-Ride to home (3.8). Rated only above fair were availability of
evening service (3.6) and availability of weekend service (3.3). (Refer to Figure 18 and Table 11.)
The ratings for several convenience service dimensions have improved since 1998. Improving most significantly between
1998 and 2008 were the two lowest rated: availability of evening service (3.2 to 3.6) and availability of weekend service
(2.9 to 3.3). Also improving were: service to areas you want to go (3.8 to 4.1) and closeness of park-n-Ride to home (3.6

Among the service dimensions for customer information, ease of understanding bus schedules (4.1)
was rated better than good. Rated, on average, slightly below good was notice of route and schedule
changes (3.8). Route information at bus stops (3.6) was rated lower than the other customer
information service dimensions with a mean rating between fair and good. (Refer to Figure 19 and
Table 12.)
The mean rating for ease of understanding bus schedules has not changed since 1998. The rating for
notice of route and schedule changes declined between 2005 and 2008 (4.0 to 3.8). Evaluation of
route information at bus stops was not asked prior to 2008.

On-time performance (4.0) was the only service dimension under travel time that received a mean
rating of good. Rated slightly below good were amount of travel time between origin and final
destination (3.9), frequency of buses on your route (3.9), required number of transfers (3.8) and
reliability of transfer connections (3.8). Rated lowest among the travel time service dimensions was
waiting time when transferring (3.6). (Refer to Figure 20 and Table 14.)
The ratings for three of the travel time service dimensions have slightly improved between 1998 and 2008: frequency of
buses (3.7 to 3.9), required number of transfers (3.7 to 3.8) and waiting time when transferring (3.5 to 3.6). Reliability of
transfer connections (not rated in 1998) improved slightly between 2005 and 2008 (3.7 to 3.8). The highest rated service
dimension, on-time performance, declined slightly between 2005 and 2008 (4.1 to 4.0).

Comfort
The ratings given to the service dimensions for comfort also showed significant variance.
Cleanliness of bus interiors (4.0) and temperature level on bus (4.0) were rated, on average,
good, while availability of seats (3.9) was rated slightly below good. Rated significantly lower
were cleanliness of bus stop shelters (3.3) and availability of bus stop shelters (3.2) – both with
an average rating slightly better than fair. (Refer to Figure 21 and Table 15.)

Some comfort service dimensions improved slightly and others declined slightly between 1998
and 2008. The ratings for cleanliness of bus interiors (3.9 to 4.0) and temperature level on bus
(3.8 to 4.0) improved slightly, while the ratings for availability of seats (4.0 to 3.9) and
availability of bus stop shelters (3.3 to 3.2) declined slightly. Cleanliness of bus interiors has
remained unchanged since 1998.

Traveling with Bicycles

In 2008, 18% of bus passengers had ridden a bicycle to/from a bus stop or park-nRide within the past six months. In total, 16% had taken their bike on the bus, while
4% had parked their bike at a bus stop or park-n-Ride (some had done both). The
service dimensions regarding traveling with bicycles were all rated, on average,
between fair and good. The service dimensions were all rated essentially the same:
availability of parking spaces for bikes at bus stop or park-n-Ride (3.5), security of
parked bike at bus stop or park-n-Ride (3.5), availability of information about bike
parking and traveling on bus with bikes (3.5) and availability of space on bus to take
bike (3.4). These service dimensions were rated for the first time in 2008, thus no
comparisons can be made to previous surveys. (Refer to Figure 22 and Table 16.)

DESIRED IMPROVEMENTS
 Performance Categories
In 2008, more than three out of ten bus passengers (31%) identified pricing/fares as being most in need of improvement.
The next most frequently selected areas for improvement were convenience (19%), travel time (12%) and
security/safety (7%). A relatively large percentage of bus riders (15%) said none of these areas were in need of
improvement. (Refer to Figure 23.)
Since 1998, there has been a significant increase in the identification of pricing/fares being most in need of improvement
(14% in 1998 to 21% in 2005 to 31% in 2008). This increase is probably due to RTD fare increases and changes to fare
policy that occurred in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2008.
The most important area for improvement was generally consistent by type of bus service, with a few exceptions.
Pricing/fares was the most frequently mentioned performance area by passengers using each type of service, except
Longmont Local passengers who identified convenience most frequently. Higher percentages of Express and Regional
passengers identified park-n-Rides compared to passengers using other types of service. Denver Local riders were
more likely to identify security/safety than other riders. (Refer to Table 17.)

Specific Dimensions of Service

Another approach for identifying areas for potential improvement is to look at those service dimensions with relatively high
percentages of poor or very poor ratings (10% or higher). These service dimensions also received the lowest mean score
ratings. The lowest rated service dimensions are found in 8 of the 11 performance categories. (Refer to Table 18.)

CORRELATION BETWEEN SERVICE DIMENSIONS AND OVERALL BUS PERFORMANCE
Correlation analysis was conducted to identify the service dimensions where satisfaction was most directly related to the
overall performance rating for bus service. There was a positive correlation between all service dimensions and the
overall performance rating. Those service dimensions more highly correlated to overall bus performance were primarily
related to travel time, security/safety, customer information and pricing/fares:
Frequency of buses on route
On-time performance of bus
Amount of total travel time from origin to final destination
Waiting time when transferring to another bus/call-n-Ride
Reliability of transfer connections
Feeling of safety at bus stops
Feeling of safety on the bus
Notice of route, schedule and other service changes
Ease of understanding RTD bus schedules

V. CHARACTERISTICS OF BUS RIDERS
This section profiles RTD bus riders by illustrating trends in the following areas:
Use of RTD light rail
Use of RTD special transportation services
Type of bus rider
Use of RTD web site
Most important reasons for riding RTD
Demographic characteristics of RTD bus riders by type of service and “captive” vs. “choice” riders
Language characteristics of bus riders

USE OF OTHER RTD TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
 Use of RTD Light Rail Service
A sizeable percentage of bus riders are also regular light rail riders. In 2008, 30% of the bus riders
had ridden light rail at least once in the past week. Since 22% of the bus riders had used light rail for
a portion of the trip on which they had received their surveys, another 8% of the riders had used light
rail for another trip within the past week. In total, bus riders had made, on average, 1.5 one-way light
rail trips in the past week.
In total, the majority of bus riders (55%) had ridden light rail at least once in the past 12 months. This represents an
increase from 49% in 1998 and 50% in 2005.

In 2008, 77% of the bus riders had used one or more of RTD’s special services within the past 12 months. The majority of
bus riders (59%) had used the 16th Street Mall Shuttle, while 18% had ridden skyRide in the past 12 months. call-n-Ride
(7%), Rockies Ride (4%), BroncosRide (3%), access-a-Ride (2%) and BuffRide (1%) were used by smaller percentages
of bus riders. (Refer to Table 20.)
Total use of special services among bus riders has remained essentially the same since 1998. Except for call-n-Ride, use
of most RTD special services among bus riders has declined since 1998. The most significant declines were the 16th
Street Mall Shuttle (67% to 59%) and RockiesRide (9% to 4%). call-n-Ride was a relatively new and limited service in
2001, and its use among bus riders increased from 5% to 7% between 2005 and 2008 with the addition of new call-n-Ride
service areas.

 Type of Bus Rider
A regular rider is defined as one who made one or more one-way trips on either light rail or regular bus service during the
past week (not including the trip on which they received the survey). Using this definition, the 2008 bus passengers can
be segmented into four categories: regular bus rider only (48%), regular bus and light rail rider (27%), regular light
rail rider only (3%) and non-regular rider (22%). Between 2005 and 2008, the percentage of regular bus riders has
declined (58% to 48%), while the percentage of regular bus and light rail riders (23% to 27%) and non-regular riders (15%
to 22%) has increased. No comparable survey data is available for 1998. (Refer to Figure 24.)



Use of RTD’s Web Site

The majority of bus riders (54%) had used RTD’s web site (www.RTD-Denver.com) to either use the trip planner or obtain
other information within the past 30 days. While 40% of bus riders had used the web site for the trip planner, 34% had
used the web site for information other than the trip planner. In total, a net of 54% of all bus riders had used the web site
within the past 30 days in 2008.
In 2008, use of RTD’s web site for any purpose varied significantly by type of bus service. Passengers who rode Regional
(67%) and Express (65%) were more likely to use RTD’s web site than those who rode Boulder Local (57%), Denver
Local (51%) or Longmont Local (38%) routes. (Refer to Figure 25.)

MOST IMPORTANT REASON FOR RIDING RTD
“No car available/do not drive” was the most important reason for riding RTD among more than one-half of the bus riders
(51%). One out of five bus riders (21%) said that “cheaper than driving” was their most important reason. Other reasons
were most important to small percentages of bus riders. (Refer to Table 21.)
“No car available/do not drive” was the most important reason for the largest segments of Denver Local (56%), Boulder
Local (44%) and Longmont Local (80%) riders, but not for Express (12%) or Regional (18%) riders. Express (29%) and
Regional (26%) riders were most likely to say that “cheaper than driving car” was the most important reason for riding
RTD. Express and Regional riders were also more likely than other bus riders to cite “avoid traffic,” “employer pays for all
or part of transit pass” and “saves wear and tear on car” as their most important reason. The most important reasons for
riding RTD were very similar in 2005 and 2008.

DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS


By Type of Service

RTD bus riders represent all demographic and socio-economic segments of the Denver
metropolitan area. The demographic characteristics measured were: gender, age, marital
status, education level, county of residence, occupation, ethnicity, annual household
income, household size and transit dependency. (Refer to Table 22.) Since Denver Local
riders account for 79% of all RTD bus boardings, any attempt to create a “typical” profile of all
bus riders would merely mirror the demographics of Denver Local riders and ignore the
demographic characteristics of riders using the other types of bus service. The following are the most prevalent
demographic characteristics by type of service:

Captive and Choice Riders

“Captive” or transit dependent riders are defined as those who do not have a car available at the time they ride RTD or
have a physical/mental disability that prevents them from driving a car. Transit dependent riders account for 56% of all
RTD bus riders. “Choice” riders are those that have a car available and are able to drive it. Choice riders account for
44% of all RTD bus riders.
The demographic characteristics of “choice” and “captive” bus riders are profiled in Table 23. “Captive” and “choice”
riders are generally similar by gender, age and household size. The most significant differences between these two types
of bus riders are:
-

Captive riders are far more likely than choice riders to be single (75% vs. 51%).

-

Captive riders are far less likely than choice riders to have a college degree or higher (23% vs. 50%).

-

Captive riders are more likely than choice riders to be residents of Denver County (49% vs. 29%).

-

Captive riders are more likely than choice riders to be employed in non-professional occupations (46% vs.
32%) and less likely to be employed in professional/managerial occupations (17% vs. 52%).

-

Captive riders have lower annual household incomes (57% under $25,000 compared to 18% of choice riders).

-

Captive riders are more likely than choice riders to be ethnic minorities (49% vs. 36%).

LANGUAGE CHARACTERISTICS
Hispanic/Latino passengers represent a fast growing market for RTD ridership. The Hispanic share of the population in
the seven-county Denver Metropolitan Area increased dramatically from 12% to 18% between 1990 and 2000. RTD’s
Multi-Cultural Program’s purpose is to improve communications with the District’s diverse populations, including Spanishspeaking residents. To support this effort, the Bus Customer Satisfaction Survey was provided in Spanish, and language
characteristic questions were included for the first time in the 2001 survey.
In 2008, a sizeable percentage of bus riders (15%) said they spoke a language other than English on a regular basis at
home. Two-thirds of those speaking another language (67%) spoke Spanish. Thus, 10% of all surveyed bus passengers
spoke Spanish on a regular basis at home. However, the majority of those who spoke Spanish (71%) said they spoke
English either very well (54%) or well (17%). Only 29% of the Spanish-speaking bus passengers said they spoke
English not well (19%) or not at all (10%). Thus, 3% of all bus passengers speak Spanish and have difficulty with
English. (Refer to Figure 26.)
The percentage of riders who speak Spanish and have difficulty with English was higher among those using Local bus
service and lower among Express and Regional riders.

In addition to Spanish, 47 other languages were mentioned including French, German, Arabic and Chinese, but none
were mentioned by a large percentage of riders. Nearly all of those who speak these other languages (98%) said they
spoke English very well (77%) or well (21%).
The percentages of bus riders who speak other languages or have difficulty with English have not significantly changed
since 2001.

HIGHLIGHTS
The 2008 RTD Light Rail Customer Satisfaction Survey was conducted with an on-board survey of 1,205 randomly
selected riders. Key findings from the survey include:

EVALUATION OF SERVICE
 Light rail passengers expressed high satisfaction with service. In 2008, more than nine out of ten light rail passengers
(93%) rated overall service as either good (58%) or excellent (35%). Only 7% of all riders rated service as fair, while
1% rated it poor or very poor.
 Overall satisfaction with RTD light rail service did not vary significantly by light rail line, time period, trip purpose or the
demographic characteristics of the riders.
 In 2008, most light rail performance categories received average ratings of good (on a scale of very poor to excellent):
travel time, comfort, ticket vending machines, convenience, web site and customer information. Two
performance categories received average ratings slightly below good: park-n-Rides and Telephone Information
Center. The other performance categories received average ratings between fair and good: pricing/fares, stations
and traveling with bicycles.
 The largest segment of light rail riders identified pricing/fares (23%) as being most in need of improvement. Other
performance categories identified by relatively large percentages of riders included: park-n-Rides (15%),
security/safety (10%) and travel time (9%).
 Most of the specific light rail service dimensions received average ratings approaching good or better. Several service
dimensions received high scores with good or excellent ratings of 80% or higher.

TRIP CHARACTERISTICS
 Work commuters account for nearly two-thirds (64%) of all light rail passengers. Work commuters were evenly divided
between those who worked in Downtown Denver (32%) or other places (32%). A significant percentage of the light rail
passengers (13%) were commuting to school/college – primarily to/from the Auraria Campus. Nearly one-fourth of the
light rail riders (24%) rode RTD for other non-work trips such as personal business (10%), social/recreational (9%),
shopping/eating out (2%), medical appointments (2%), and business meetings (1%).
 More than seven out of ten light rail passengers (74%) pay their fare with a form of prepayment – primarily by Eco
Pass (23%), monthly pass/ValuPass (23%), Auraria Student pass (12%) and 10-Ride Ticketbook (11%). Slightly more
than two out of ten riders (23%) pay by cash.
 In 2008, 10% of the light rail riders used a special fare discount: senior (4%), disabled (3%) and student (19 and
under) (3%).
 There are three primary ways in which light rail passengers traveled to the light rail station for their trip: walked (43%),
drove alone and parked (21%) and RTD bus (18%).
 The average distance of the total trip for light rail passengers (one-way distance between origin and destination) was
16.2 miles.
 In 2008, 31% of light rail passengers made a transfer to/from a regular RTD bus, call-n-Ride or skyRide for their trip.
 Nearly one-half of the light rail riders (45%) parked at a RTD park-n-Ride or light rail station for their trip.
 In 2008, light rail passengers had taken, on average, 5.1 one-way rides on RTD light rail during the past week.
 New riders (those who had been riding RTD for less than one year) accounted for 27% of all light rail riders in 2008.

RIDER CHARACTERISTICS
 RTD light rail passengers represent all demographic and socio-economic segments of the Denver metropolitan area.
However, light rail is ridden primarily by adults 25 – 54 years of age (67%) with an almost equal split between men
(51%) and women (49%). Three out of four riders are White/Caucasian (76%), while 11% are African American, 9%
are Hispanic and 4% are other ethnicities. Light rail riders report a wide range of household incomes with most (71%)
having household incomes of $35,000 or more. The primary occupation of light rail riders is professional/managerial
(52%). The majority of riders (59%) has either a college degree or post graduate degree. A slight majority of light rail
riders were single (52%) and the average household size of riders is 2.6.
 While Hispanics represent an increasing segment of light rail riders (9% in 2008), very few (less than 1% of all riders)
spoke Spanish and also had difficulty with English.
 One-fourth of light rail riders (25%) are classified as “captive” or transit dependent. “Captive” riders are defined as
those who do not have a car available at the time they ride RTD or have a physical/mental disability that prevents them
from driving a car. “Choice” riders (those who have a car available and are able to drive it) account for 75% of all light
rail passengers – suggesting that light rail has helped to reduce auto traffic and improve the environment.
 Four out of ten light rail riders (40%) had ridden an RTD bus within the past week (an average of 2.9 one-way trips),
while 60% had ridden an RTD bus at least once in the past 12 months.
 In 2008, eight out of ten light rail riders (80%) had used one or more of RTD’s special services within the past 12
months. They were most likely to have used the 16th Street Mall Shuttle (75%) and skyRide (17%).
 The most frequently selected reasons for riding RTD among light rail passengers were “cheaper than driving” (26%),
“no car available/do not drive” (22%), “avoid parking” (12%), “avoid traffic” (12%) and “employer pays for all or part of
transit pass” (10%).

MAJOR CHANGES SINCE 1998
 The percentage of passengers who ride light rail for work in locations other than Downtown Denver has increased
between 1998 (25%) and 2008 (32%). This is due to the opening of the Southeast Light Rail corridor in 2006 which
provides access to a number of business parks along the South I-25 corridor.
 The percentages of light rail passengers paying their fare with a monthly pass/Valupass has declined from 28% in
1998 to 23% in 2008, while use of Eco Pass has increased from 13% in 1998 to 23% in 2008.
 Use of some form of fare discount (seniors, disabled and student – 19 and under) has significantly declined over time
from 24% in 1998 to 10 in 2008. This is due to a change in student eligibility in 2005.
 A larger percentage of light rail riders were occasional riders (they had taken no light rail trips in the week prior to the
trip on which they were surveyed) in 2008 (31%) compared to 1998 (18%). This results in a decrease in the weekly
ridership frequency between 1998 and 2008 (6.3 one-way trips to 5.1 one-way trips).
 While the total percentage of light rail passengers who rated service as either excellent or good was similar in 1998,
2006 and 2008, the percent of passengers rating service as excellent improved between 2006 and 2008 (24% to
35%).
 The composite ratings for several light rail service performance categories have improved since 1998: ticket vending
machines, convenience, web site, park-n-Rides, and Telephone Information Center.
 Since 1998, pricing/fares has emerged as the one area that light rail riders identify as being most in need of
improvement (6% to 23% of all riders), while park-n-Rides has significantly declined as being most in need of
improvement (27% to 15%).

I. INTRODUCTION
The Regional Transportation District’s (RTD’s) commitment to customers includes the goal of meeting present and future
public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service. In order to assess
how well the service level delivered matches customer expectations, RTD conducted on-board surveys of bus, light rail,
call-n-Ride and skyRide riders. The benefits of conducting customer satisfaction studies and implementing required
service improvements include:
-

Higher customer retention
Increased referrals
Higher ridership
Greater efficiency
Increased farebox revenue
Enhanced public image and support

The 2008 Light Rail Customer Satisfaction Survey questionnaire was developed jointly by RTD’s Market Research
Department and The Howell Research Group. The Howell Research Group was responsible for the distribution of the
questionnaire and the tabulation and analysis of the survey results. This report presents the overall findings from the
2008 Light Rail Customer Satisfaction Survey. RTD board members and the planning, operations, marketing and
customer services staff should find this report a vital resource.

OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of the 2008 Light Rail Customer Satisfaction Survey were to determine:
1.
2.
3.
4.

FARE & SERVICE CHANGES SINCE 2006
RTD has made fare adjustments and numerous improvements to services and facilities since the 2006 Light Rail
Customer Satisfaction Survey, which may be underlying factors that impact customer satisfaction ratings. The major light
rail changes are presented below by year.



2006

 Effective July 1, pricing for the existing Southwest, Central and Platte Valley light rail system changed from one fixed
fare boundary to a fare zone system consisting of three fare zones. The old Hampden Avenue light rail fare boundary
was eliminated, and light rail fares were instead determined by the number of zones a passenger travels in for each
one way trip: one or two contiguous zones equal a Local fare, and three zones equal an Express fare.
 Opening of the Southeast Light Rail lines on November 17, including:
- 19 new miles of light rail, running along the west side of I-25 from Broadway in Denver to Lincoln Avenue in
Douglas County, and in the median of I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road in Aurora, connecting the two largest
employment centers in the Denver region
- Frequency of Trains: Trains from Lincoln Avenue to Downtown Denver 7.5 minute average peak headways,
15 minute average off-peak/weekend headways; trains from Nine Mile to Downtown Denver 15 minute
average peak headways, 15 minute average off-peak/weekend headways
- 13 light rail stations
- park-n-Rides at all stations except for the Louisiana-Pearl station, providing a total of 6,000 parking spaces
along the southeast corridor
- New light rail maintenance facility with new communications and control system
- With the expansion of the light rail system, the fare zone system was expanded from three to four zones,
with travel in one or two zones equaling a Local fare, three zones an Express fare and four zones equaling a
Regional fare
- Opening of seven new or improved call-n-Rides
- Extensive bus feeder system to transport light rail riders to/from the stations
 RTD placed into operation 34 new light rail vehicles

II. METHODOLOGY
QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT
Customer satisfaction was measured by asking light rail riders to rate RTD’s performance based on their recent trip
experience. A set of critical performance attributes was identified from several different sources:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

RTD Customer Panel
RTD customer complaints and comments
Previously conducted on-board surveys of RTD customers
Input from RTD’s marketing personnel
Input from RTD department heads
Customer satisfaction studies conducted by other transit agencies

The questionnaire used for the 2008 Light Rail Customer Satisfaction Survey is presented in Appendix A.

SAMPLING
The 2008 Light Rail Customer Satisfaction Survey was conducted with a self-administered, on-board survey of randomly
selected weekday RTD passengers riding the C, D, E, F, G and H lines as shown on the map on page 12. The
questionnaires were distributed weekdays to light rail passengers at the stations while they awaited the arrival of trains. A
sampling plan was designed to distribute the questionnaires in proportion to actual boardings based on station location,
train direction and time of day.
Each survey packet consisted of a cover letter (included on questionnaire) explaining the purpose of the survey, the
questionnaire, a pencil, coupons for two free rides and a postage-paid return envelope. The questionnaires were
distributed between October 30 and November 7, 2008. The survey questionnaire was available in Spanish for riders who
felt more comfortable completing a Spanish version. Only 5 light rail passengers completed Spanish questionnaires. In
addition to the two free ride coupons, respondents could enter a drawing for one of 20 $50 King Soopers gift certificates
as an incentive for participation.

Of the 3,000 survey packets distributed among RTD light rail riders, 1,205 were returned (40.2% response rate).
Assuming that the completed questionnaires represent a truly random sample, the overall results for the 2008 Light Rail
Customer Satisfaction Survey are statistically reliable within ± 2.8 % at the 95% confidence level. In comparison, the
response rates and statistical reliabilities for the 1998 and 2006 Light Rail Customer Satisfaction Surveys are presented

Note: The number of surveys distributed in 2008 was significantly increased over previous years to reflect the
increased ridership and expansion of the light rail system.

WEIGHTING
Since the survey questionnaires were not completed and returned in the same proportions as their distribution, the light
rail data was weighted for analysis purposes to reflect accurately the proportion of ridership by five time periods: before 6
am, 6 am – 9 am, 9 am – 3 pm, 3 pm – 6 pm and after 6 pm. For example, actual boarding data shows that 25% of light
rail boardings occur between 6 am and 9 am, but 46% of the completed surveys were from riders boarding during this
time period. Thus, the survey data for this time period was weighted down to reflect 25% of the data. The specific
weighting factors by time period are presented in Appendix B.

BOARDING CHARACTERISTICS
Boarding characteristics of the light rail survey respondents for line and time period
are presented in Table 1 and compared to actual rider data based on RTD’s August
2008 runboard statistics. Comparisons to previous light rail surveys are not
appropriate because RTD opened four new lines since the 2006 Light Rail Customer
Satisfaction Survey.
The survey data is very comparable to actual boardings by line. The largest
percentage of light rail survey respondents had ridden the D Line (35%) followed by
the F Line (25%), H Line (19%), E Line (12%), C Line (6%) and G Line (2%).
The distribution of survey respondents by time period reflects actual boardings, because the survey data was weighted by
time period. Light rail boardings are about evenly divided between peak hours (6am – 9am and 3pm – 6pm) and nonpeak hours (52% and 48% respectively).
Off-peak riders are a prime target market for increasing ridership during periods of excess seating capacity on light rail.
Off-peak riders account for nearly one-half (48%) of all light rail passengers. Off-peak riders take a significantly larger
proportion of non-work trips than peak hour riders (53% vs. 20%). Off-peak riders make relatively more trips for

school/college, personal business and social/entertainment purposes than peak riders. One out of three off-peak riders
(33%) pay cash fares compared to 17% of the peak riders. Off-peak riders are heavy users of the RTD Telephone
Information Center (TIC). Off-peak riders called the TIC an average of 1.5 times within the past 30 days compared to only
0.7 times for peak riders. Off-peak riders are more likely to be transit dependent than peak riders (30% vs. 21%).

TRIP PURPOSE
The work commuter is a key market segment with commuting to/from work being the most common
trip purpose. In 2008, nearly two-thirds of light rail passengers (64%) rode RTD for commuting to/from
work. Work commuters were evenly divided between those who worked in Downtown Denver (32%)
or other places (32%). In total, 7% were commuting to/from work in the southeast business parks
located along the South I-25 corridor. (Refer to Figure 1 and Table 2.)
One-half of all light rail commuters (51%) are frequent riders. The typical work commuter averaged 5.7
one-way light rail trips per week. Most work trips (64%) occurred during the peak hours. Light rail
lines D, F and H were the most frequently used for work trips. Work commuters were more likely than
non-work riders to have parked at an RTD park-n-Ride or light rail station for their trip (51% vs. 35%).
Most work commuters used an Eco Pass (34%) or a monthly pass (28%) to pay their fare.
The second largest percentage of light rail passengers (13%) were commuting to school/college – primarily to/from the
Auraria Campus. Nearly one-fourth of the light rail riders (24%) rode RTD for other non-work trips such as personal
business (10%), social/recreational (9%), shopping/eating out (2%), medical appointments (2%) and business meetings
(1%).
The percentage of passengers riding light rail to/from work increased between 2006 and 2008 (56% to 64%). The most
notable increase was commuting to/from work in non-Downtown locations (27% to 32%). This is due to the opening of the
Southeast Light Rail corridor in 2006 which provides access to a number of business parks along the South I-25 corridor
including the Denver Tech Center, Greenwood Plaza, Inverness and Meridian. The percentage of riders using light rail for
shopping/eating out declined significantly between 2006 and 2008 (12% to 2%), while the percentage using light rail for
personal business increased significantly (4% to 10%).

METHOD OF FARE PAYMENT
More than seven out of ten light rail passengers (74%) pay their fare with a form of prepayment
– primarily by Eco Pass (23%), monthly pass/ValuPass (23%), Auraria Student Pass (12%)
and 10-Ride Ticketbook (11%). Only 23% of riders pay by cash. (Refer to Figure 2 and Table
3.)
Riders paying their fare with an Eco Pass, monthly pass or Valupass averaged a much higher
number of one-way light rail trips per week (6.2) compared to those who paid their fare with a
10 Ride Ticketbook (4.9), Auraria Student Pass (4.7), DU Student Pass (4.4) or cash (3.7).
While the use of some form of prepayment has remained fairly consistent since 1998, the specific types of prepayment
used have varied. The percentages of light rail passengers paying their fare with a monthly pass/ValuPass has declined
from 28% in 1998 to 23% in 2008, while use of Eco Pass has increased from 13% in 1998 to 23% in 2008. Use of cash
has declined from 29% in 1998 to 23% in 2008.
Light rail fares are based on a zone system. In 2008, 48% of light rail passengers traveled in one or two zones requiring a
Local fare, 44% traveled in three zones requiring an Express fare and 8% traveled in four zones requiring a Regional fare.

Use of some form of fare discount (seniors, disabled and student – 19 and under) has significantly declined since 1998
from 24% to 7% in 2006 and 10% in 2008. In 2008, small percentages of light rail passengers used senior (4%), disabled
(3%) or student – under 19 (3%) discounts. RTD changed student pass eligibility in January 2005. Prior to January 2005,
the student discount was available to all riders with a current student I.D. Since January 2005, the student discount is
only available to elementary, middle and high school students ages 6 – 19. This explains the significant decline in use of
student discounts since 1998. (Refer to Figure 3.)

ACCESS TO/FROM LIGHT RAIL STATION
Each light rail trip includes access to a station and access from a station to final
destination. Since nearly all riders make two one-way light rail trips during the day,
and their return trip is most likely a reverse of their first trip, the type of access to a
light rail station should be very comparable to the access used from that station.
Walking (43%) is the primary mode of access to or from light rail stations followed by
drove alone and parked (21%) and transferring to/from an RTD bus (18%/20%). In
total, motor vehicles accounted for 28%/27% of the access to/from stations, while RTD
services accounted for 25%/26% of the access to/from stations. (Refer to Table 4.)
Riders traveling during the peak hours (6am – 9am and 3pm – 6pm) were more likely than non-peak hour riders to access
their light rail station by driving alone and parking (46% vs. 32%).

TRANSFER FREQUENCY
An estimation of RTD service transfers (excluding the 16th Street Mall Shuttle) as part of the light rail
trips can be made by combining bus, call-n-Ride and skyRide access to/from the stations. Most light
rail passengers (68%) do not transfer. One out of three (32%) light rail passengers made at least
one transfer: 21% made one transfer, 10% made two transfers and 1% made three or more
transfers. (Refer to Figure 4.)

LENGTH OF TRIP
Light rail passengers were asked to indicate the length of their total trip (including all modes of travel) in miles (total oneway distance between origin and destination). In 2008, the average trip distance for all light rail passengers was 16.2
miles. This was slightly longer than the average trip length in 2006 (15.6 miles). The increased trip length is most
probably due to the opening of Southeast Light Rail in 2006 which extended service into Douglas County. (Refer to Table
5.)
Trip length varies by trip purpose. The average trip length (miles) for work (17.3) and school/college (17.2) was
considerably longer than other types of trips (12.7).

WEEKLY RIDERSHIP FREQUENCY
In 2008, all light rail passengers had taken, on average, 5.1 one-way trips on RTD light rail during the past week. Three
out of ten light rail passengers (31%) were only occasional riders, meaning that they had taken no light rail trips in the
week prior to the trip on which they were surveyed. Occasional riders were far more likely than more frequent riders to be
riding light rail for non-work purposes such as medical appointments and business meetings. While actual light rail
ridership has skyrocketed since 1998, ridership frequency per passenger has declined (6.3 in 1998 to 5.5 in 2006 to 5.1 in
2008) due to increases in the percentages of occasional riders. (Refer to Figure 5.)
Since the Light Rail Customer Satisfaction Survey sampling was based on boardings, someone who rides more frequently
has a better chance of being surveyed than someone who rides less frequently. Thus, the ridership frequencies
presented below may overestimate the average frequency of all persons who might ride light rail during a given period of
time. An alternative method, called the “harmonic mean,” adjusts for the lower probability of less frequent riders being
sampled. Calculating ridership frequency using the harmonic mean results in an average of 4.3 one-way light rail trips in
the past week among all riders. This is a somewhat lower frequency than was calculated using a straight arithmetic mean
(5.1).

NEW RIDERS
New riders are those who had been riding RTD for less than one year. The
percentage of new RTD riders using light rail was 27% in 2008. The percentage
of new riders using light rail was highest in 1998 (30%) and declined slightly to
27% in 2006 and 2008. (Refer to Figure 6.)
The demographic characteristics of new light rail riders are generally consistent
with the demographics of previous riders. The only significant variance was
age, where new riders were more likely than previous riders to be under 35
years of age (43% vs. 31%).
Most light rail riders have been riding for an extended period – 73% have been riding one or more years.

IV. RIDER EVALUATION OF LIGHT RAIL SERVICE
Light rail passengers were asked to evaluate RTD light rail service on 38 separate dimensions in 11 different performance
categories. These measures reflect the kinds of decisions potential and existing passengers make, consciously or not,
when deciding to use public transit or another mode, usually the private automobile.
The ratings were conducted using a five-point narrative scale comprised of very poor, poor, fair, good and excellent.
Mean scores have been calculated for these ratings by assigning integer values of “1” to very poor, “2” to poor, “3” to
fair, “4” to good, “5” to excellent and disregarding the no opinions.

OVERALL RATING OF RTD LIGHT RAIL SERVICE
Riders were asked to rate the overall performance of light rail service. In 2008, more than
nine out of ten light rail passengers (93%) rated light rail service as either excellent (35%) or
good (58%). Only 7% of the riders rated light rail service as fair, while 1% rated it as poor or
very poor. (Refer to Table 6.)
The overall ratings of light rail service were very similar for peak (4.2) and off-peak riders (4.3).
The ratings did not significantly vary by light rail line, except for Line G riders who rated overall
service slightly lower (4.1) than other riders. However, the base of Line G survey respondents
is very small, thus, this data should be used with caution.
While the total percentage of light rail passengers who rated overall service as either good or excellent in 2008 (93%) was
similar to 1998 (90%) and 2006 (91%), the percent of passengers rating overall service as excellent was higher in 2008
(35%) compared to 1998 (32%) and 2006 (24%). The average rating for overall light rail service was higher in 2008 (4.3)
than 1998 (4.2) and 2006 (4.1). (Refer to Figure 7.)

COMPOSITE RATINGS OF LIGHT RAIL PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES
A composite rating was calculated for each performance category by averaging the mean score ratings (1 – 5) for all of
the separate dimensions rated in the performance category.
Receiving the highest composite rating in 2008 was travel time (4.1). Comfort (4.0), ticket vending machines (4.0),
convenience (4.0), web site (4.0) and customer information (4.0) also received composite ratings of good. The
composite ratings for park-n-Rides (3.9) and Telephone Information Center (3.8) were slightly below good.
Pricing/fares (3.7) and stations/stops (3.6) received composite scores between fair and good, while traveling with
bicycles (3.3) received a composite rating slightly above fair. (Refer to Figure 8.)
Composite ratings for some performance categories could not be compared to 1998 and/or 2006, because the specific
service dimensions within a performance category were not comparable. Some performance categories have improved
significantly since 1998. The largest improvements were measured for ticket vending machines (3.7 to 4.0) and park-nRides (3.6 to 3.9). Composite rating improvements were measured between 2006 and 2008 for convenience (3.8 to 4.0)
and web site (3.8 to 4.0).

RATINGS OF SERVICE DIMENSIONS
 Travel Time
The service dimensions for travel time were all rated, on average, as good or better
than good. Rated above good in 2008 were on-time performance (4.3) and amount of
travel time required from origin to final destination (4.1). Rated good was frequency of
trains (4.0) and reliability of bus/light rail connections (4.0). (Refer to Figure 9 and
Table 7.)
The ratings remained essentially the same for on-time performance (4.3 to 4.3) and
frequency of trains (4.1 to 4.0) between 1998 and 2008. The average rating for
reliability of bus/light rail connections (3.7 to 4.0) improved between 1998 and 2008.

Among the three comfort service dimensions, smoothness of ride (4.1) and cleanliness of
train interiors (4.1) were rated slightly above good in 2008. Consistent with past surveys,
availability of seats (3.7) was rated lowest among the comfort service dimensions. (Refer to
Figure 10 and Table 8.)
Two comfort service dimensions: smoothness of ride and availability of seats have been rated
the same in all three surveys. The rating for cleanliness of train interiors has declined slightly
from 4.2 in 1998 to 4.1 in 2008.

Light rail riders were asked to rate RTD’s web site regarding the trip planner and obtaining other
information. Four out of ten light rail passengers (40%) said they used the trip planner on RTD’s
web site within the past 30 days (average use was 3.5 times). Those that had used the web site
trip planner rated accuracy of information (4.1) slightly better than good and ease of use (3.9)
slightly below good. The rating for accuracy of information improved significantly between 2006 and
2008 (3.8 to 4.1), while ease of use improved slightly (3.8 to 3.9). A slightly smaller percentage of
light rail riders (37%) had used RTD’s web site for information other than the trip planner within the
past 30 days. These riders rated web site information other than the trip planner (3.9) slightly below
good. (Refer to Figure 13 and Table 11.)
In total, 54% of all light rail riders had used the RTD web site within the past 30 days for either the trip planner or other
information.

 Customer Information
Rated highest among five customer information service dimensions were route map and schedule information
at stations (4.2) and ease of understanding light rail timetables (4.1) – both rated, on average, better than good.
Signage directing riders to train platform, parking, transfers, ticket machines, etc. received an average rating of
good (4.0). The two audio customer information service dimensions: clarity/reliability of public address system
on train (3.9) and onboard announcement of train delays (3.7) were rated below good. (Refer to Figure 14 and
Table 12.)
The mean rating for ease of understanding light rail timetables improved between 1998 and 2008 (3.9 to 4.1),
while the mean rating for clarity/reliability of public address system on trains declined (4.1 to 3.9). Ratings of the other
three customer information service dimensions could not be compared to previous surveys.

 park-n-Rides
Nearly one-half of the light rail passengers (45%) parked at an RTD park-n-Ride
on the day of the survey. The top five park-n-Rides used by light rail riders were
Nine Mile (15%), Littleton/Mineral (15%), Lincoln (12%), Englewood (9%) and
Littleton/Downtown (8%). The average distance between the riders’ homes and
their park-n-Rides was 5.5 miles.
The park-n-Ride user is another key target market for RTD. Most park-n-Ride
users (60%) start their light rail trip during the peak hours. Light rail riders who
use a park-n-Ride made an average of 5.2 one-way light rail trips in the past
week - nearly one-half (47%) are frequent light rail riders making 5 or more oneway trips per week. park-n-Ride users primarily ride the D, F and H lines. A
large majority of park-n-Ride users (72%) are work commuters with nearly one-half (48%) working in Downtown Denver.
The distance from their home to the park-n-Ride averages 5.5 miles. The majority of park-n-Ride users paid their fare
with either an Eco Pass (32%) or monthly/ValuPass (23%).
The ratings of park-n-Ride service dimensions varied significantly in 2008. Receiving an average rating slightly better
than good were cleanliness of passenger shelters (4.1) and feeling of personal safety (4.1). Rated slightly below good
was security of parked car (3.9). The lowest rated park-n-Ride service dimension was availability of parking spaces (3.6)
– an average rating between fair and good. (Refer to Figure 15 and Table 13.)
The mean ratings for all of the park-n-Ride service dimensions have improved between 1998 and 2006. Improving most
significantly was the lowest rated service dimension - availability of parking spaces (2.9 to 3.6). The other service
dimensions experienced noteworthy improvements: cleanliness of passenger shelters (3.9 to 4.1), feeling of personal
safety (3.8 to 4.1) and security of parked car (3.6 to 3.9).

 Telephone Information Center
In 2008, 22% of the light rail passengers had called RTD’s Telephone Information Center (TIC)
within the past 30 days. Those who called had made an average of 5.0 calls during this period.
They gave a mean rating of better than good to courtesy of TIC operator (4.2) and accuracy of TIC
information (4.1). Rated significantly lower between fair and good were ease of reaching live TIC
operator (3.4) and ease of using automated touch-tone system (3.4). (Refer to Figure 16 and
Table 14.)
The ratings for courtesy of TIC operator (4.0 to 4.2) and accuracy of TIC information (3.9 to 4.1)
have improved between 1998 and 2008. Ease of using automated touch-tone system declined
significantly between 1998 and 2006 (3.5 to 2.8), but then significantly improved in 2008 (3.4). The
mean rating for ease of reaching live TIC operator had improved between 1998 and 2006 (3.3 to
3.5), and then slightly declined in 2008 (3.4).

The vast majority of light rail riders who had called RTD’s TIC within the past 30 days (76%) had interfaced only with a live
operator, while 14% had used only the automated touch-tone system and 10% had used both a live operator and the
automated system. Accuracy of TIC information was rated significantly higher among those who had used only a live
operator compared to those who had used the automated system (4.1 vs. 3.7). As expected, light rail riders who had
used a live operator rated ease of reaching a live RTD operator significantly higher (3.5) than those who had used the
automated system (2.9).

Light rail passengers rated the value received for fare paid for trip (4.1), on average, slightly better than good. Rated less
than good was ease of understanding light rail fare zones (3.7). Rated lowest among the pricing/fares service
dimensions was frequency of fare inspections (3.4) with an average rating between fair and good. Ratings for these
service dimensions could not be compared to the 1998 and 2006 surveys

 Stations/Stops
There were significant variances in the mean ratings given to the stations service
dimensions. In 2008, cleanliness of light rail stations (4.1) was rated slightly better than
good, while overall feeling of personal security at stations (3.8) was rated, on average,
below good. Rated significantly lower was protection from bad weather while waiting for
train (3.0) which was rated only fair by light rail passengers. (Refer to Figure 18 and
Table 16.)
Cleanliness of stations/stops improved between 1998 and 2006 (3.9 to 4.1), while
protection from bad weather has been rated the same in all previous surveys. Overall feeling of personal security could
not be compared to previous surveys.

 Traveling with Bicycles
In 2008, 17% of the light rail passengers had ridden a bicycle to/from a light rail station within the
past six months. In total, 12% had taken their bike on the train, while 6% had parked their bike at
the station (some had done both). The service dimensions regarding traveling with bicycles
were all rated, on average, better than fair but much less than good. Rated highest among these
service dimensions was availability of parking spaces for bikes at station (3.5), followed by
security of parked bike at station (3.4), availability of space on train to take bike (3.3) and
availability of information about bike parking and traveling on trains with bikes (3.2). These
service dimensions were rated for the first time in 2008, thus no comparisons can be made to
previous surveys. (Refer to Figure 19 and Table 17.)

DESIRED IMPROVEMENTS
 Performance Categories
In 2008, no single performance category was identified by a majority of light rail passengers as being most in need of
improvement. The most frequently selected area for improvement was pricing/fares (23%) followed by park-n-Rides
(15%), safety/security (10%), travel time (9%), stations (7%) and comfort (7%). Nearly one out of ten light rail riders
(9%) said none of these areas were in need of improvement. (Refer to Figure 20.)
Selection of pricing/fares as being most in need of improvement increased significantly between 1998 and 2006 (6% to
19%) and then increased further in 2008 (23%). During this same period (1998 – 2008) park-n-Rides has declined from
27% to 15% as being most in need of improvement. In the past two years (2006 – 2008), safety/security has increased
(3% to 10%), and stations (12% to 7%) and convenience (13% to 6%) have declined regarding being most in need of
improvement.
There is a direct correlation between the performance category perceived to be most in need of improvement and how
riders rated overall performance of light rail service. Riders who rated overall service only fair or poor/very poor were far
more likely to select pricing/fares as most in need of improvement (34% and 64% respectively).

 Specific Dimensions of Service
Another approach for identifying areas for potential improvement is to look at those service dimensions with relatively high
percentages of poor or unacceptable ratings. These service dimensions also received the lowest mean score ratings.
The lowest rated service dimensions among the light rail riders are presented in Table 18.

CORRELATION BETWEEN SERVICE DIMENSIONS AND OVERALL LIGHT RAIL PERFORMANCE
Correlation analysis was conducted to identify the service dimensions where satisfaction was most directly related to the
overall performance rating for light rail service. There was a positive correlation between all service dimensions and the
overall performance rating. Those service dimensions more highly correlated to overall light rail performance were
primarily related to pricing/fares, travel time and Telephone Information Center:

Use of RTD bus service
Use of other RTD special transportation services
Type of light rail rider
Most important reasons for riding RTD
Demographic characteristics of RTD light rail passengers by captive vs. choice riders

USE OF OTHER RTD TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
 Use of RTD Bus Service
A sizeable percentage of light rail riders are also regular bus riders. In 2008, four out of ten
of the light rail passengers (40%) had ridden an RTD bus at least once in the past week.
Since 30% of the light rail riders had used an RTD bus for a portion of their trip on which they
had received their surveys, another 10% of the riders had used an RTD bus for another trip
within the past week. Overall, light rail riders had made, on average, 2.9 one-way bus trips in
the past week.
In total, 60% of the light rail passengers had ridden an RTD bus at least once in the past 12 months. This represents a
decline from both 1998 (79%) and 2006 (65%).

 Use of RTD Special Services

Eight out of ten light rail passengers (80%) used one or more of RTD’s special services (other than regular bus service)
within the past 12 months. Overall use of other services among light rail riders is comparable to 1998 (83%) and 2006
(78%). In 2008, three-fourths of the light rail passengers (75%) had used the 16th Street Mall Shuttle, while 17% had used
skyRide in the past 12 months. Other services used included call-n-Ride (7%), RockiesRide (6%), BroncosRide (6%),
access-a-Ride (less than 1%) and BuffRide (less than 1%). (Refer to Table 19.)
Use of call-n-Ride among light rail passengers increased from 1% to 7% between 2006 and 2008, because new call-nRide service areas were added and existing areas were improved to better serve connections to light rail stations.

 Type of Light Rail Rider
A regular rider is defined as one who made one or more one-way trips on either light rail or regular bus service during the
past week (not including the trip on which they received the survey). Using this definition, the 2008 light rail passengers
can be segmented into four categories: regular light rail rider only (33%), regular light rail and bus rider (36%),
regular bus rider only (4%) and non-regular rider (27%). Between 2006 and 2008, the percentage of regular light rail
and bus riders declined (44% to 36%), while the percentage of non-regular riders increased (20% to 27%). No
comparable survey data is available for 1998. (Refer to Figure 21.)

MOST IMPORTANT REASON FOR RIDING RTD
In 2008, “cheaper than driving car” (26%) and “no car available/do not drive” (22%) were the most frequently selected
reasons for riding RTD among all light rail passengers. Two of the next most frequently selected reasons were also
related to cost: “avoid parking” (12%) and “employer pays for all or part of transit pass” (10%). “Avoid traffic” (12%),
“good for environment” (8%), “saves wear and tear on car” (3%), “ability to read/work while riding RTD” (3%) and “relax/
reduce stress” (1%) were mentioned less frequently as the most important reason. (Refer to Table 20.)
The most important reason for riding RTD varied by trip purpose. Those riding light rail for school/college were far more
likely than other riders to be motivated by “cheaper than driving” (38% vs. 24%). Riders whose trip purpose was non-work
or non-school were far more likely than others to be motivated by “no car available/do not drive” (41% vs. 16%).
Most important reasons for riding RTD were similar in 2006 and 2008, except that “cheaper than driving” moved from
second to first, while “no car available/do not drive” moved from first to second most frequent. This was probably due to
the significant increase in gasoline prices between 2006 and 2008.

DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS


All Light Rail Riders
RTD light rail passengers represent all demographic and socio-economic segments of the
Denver metropolitan area. (Refer to Table 21.) The demographic characteristics measured
were gender, age, marital status, education level, county of residence, occupation, ethnicity,
annual household income, household size and transit dependency.

Light rail is ridden primarily by adults 25 – 54 years of age (67%) with an almost equal split
between men (51%) and women (49%). Three out of four riders are White/Caucasian (76%), while 11% are African
American, 9% are Hispanic and 4% are other ethnicities. Light rail riders report a wide range of household incomes with
most (71%) having household incomes of $35,000 or more.
The primary occupation of light rail riders is
professional/managerial (52%). The majority of riders (59%) has either a college degree or post graduate degree. A
slight majority of light rail riders were single (52%) and the average household size of riders is 2.6. One-fourth of light rail
riders (25%) are classified as transit dependent.


Captive and Choice Light Rail Riders

“Captive” or transit dependent riders are defined as those who do not have a car available at the time they ride RTD or
have a physical/mental disability that prevents them from driving a car. Transit dependent riders account for 25% of all
RTD light rail passengers. “Choice” riders are those that have a car available and are able to drive it. Light rail has a
strong propensity to attract “choice” riders as evidenced by the findings that they account for 75% of all RTD light rail
riders. This high percentage suggests that light rail is helping to reduce auto traffic and improve the environment.
The demographic characteristics of “choice” and “captive” light rail riders are profiled in Table 21. The most significant
differences between these two types of light rail riders are:
- Captive riders are more likely to be male than choice riders (59% vs. 48%)
- Captive riders are far more likely to be single than choice riders (71% vs. 45%)
- Captive riders are far more likely to be residents of Denver County (59% vs. 28%)
- Captive riders are far less likely to have a college degree or higher (35% vs. 67%)

LANGUAGE CHARACTERISTICS
Hispanic/Latino passengers represent a fast growing market for RTD ridership. The Hispanic population of the sevencounty Denver Metropolitan Area increased dramatically from 12% to 18% between 1990 and 2000. RTD’s Multi-Cultural
Program’s purpose is to reach the District’s diverse populations, including Spanish-speaking residents. To support this
effort, the Light Rail Customer Satisfaction Survey was provided in Spanish, and language characteristic questions were
included for the first time in the 2001 survey.
A small percentage of light rail passengers (9%) said they spoke a language other than English on a regular basis at
home. Nearly one-half of those speaking another language at home (49%) spoke Spanish. Thus, 4% of all light rail
passengers spoke Spanish on a regular basis at home. However, nearly all of those who spoke Spanish (94%) said they
spoke or read English either very well (83%) or well (11%). Thus, very few of the light rail survey respondents spoke
Spanish and had difficulty with English. (Refer to Figure 22.)
In addition to Spanish, 28 other languages were mentioned including Russian, German, Arabic and Hindi, but none were
mentioned by a large percentage of riders. Nearly all of those who speak these other languages (95%) said they spoke
English very well (80%) or well (15%).

Objective

Background
Title VI and Environmental Justice Overview
Since 1972, The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Office of Civil Rights has required
recipients and sub-recipients of federal financial assistance to certify compliance with the
Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations and FTA guidance effectuating Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964. This regulation and guidance requires recipients to evaluate
significant system-wide service and fare changes and proposed improvements at the planning
and programming stages to determine whether those changes have a discriminatory impact on
minority and low-income communities.
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is a recipient of FTA financial assistance and is
therefore subject to the Title VI compliance conditions associated with the use of these funds
pursuant to FTA Circular 4704.1B, “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit
Administration Recipients,” dated October 1, 2012; and Section 12(b) of the FTA Master
Agreement.
In April of 1997, the DOT issued U.S. DOT Order 5610.2(a) affirming that it will monitor its
programs, policies and activities to ensure that disproportionately high and adverse effects on
minority and low-income populations are avoided, minimized or mitigated in compliance with
Executive Order 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low–Income Populations.” On August 15, 2012 the FTA issued Circular
4703.1, “Environmental Justice Policy Guidance for Federal Transit Administration Recipients
FTA Circular 4703.1,” effectuating DOT Order 5610.2(a).
The requirements as specified in FTA Circular 4702.1B (Title VI) and FTA Circular 4703.1
(Environmental Justice) to address disparate impacts, define the components that should be
addressed by RTD were the basis for the selection of elements reviewed and summarized in
this document.

Title VI Equity Evaluation: West Rail Line 2013 Service Changes

The purpose of this report is to summarize an equity analysis of the proposed April 2013 West
Corridor Service Plan in compliance w ith the Title VI Program requirements as specified in the
FTA Circular to 4702.1B Chapter IV.7 and FTA Circular 4703.1 and codified in 49 CFR §
21.5(b)(2), 49 CFR § 21.5(b)(7) and Appendix C to 49 CFR part 21.

Agency Profile

Approximately 98.3 million passengers boarded RTD service vehicles in 2011. This figure
represents an average of about 325,900 weekday boardings. The RTD’s transportation
network includes 148 regular fixed bus routes, 10,025 bus stops, 75 park-n-Ride transit
facilities, 35 miles of light rail track and 36 light rail stations. In addition, the RTD has a fleet of
1,025 regular buses and 153 Light Rail vehicles.
Since 1983 the RTD has been governed by a statutorily-created, 15-member Board of
Directors. Each member is elected to serve a four-year term. There are approximately 173,000
voters in each of the 15 director districts and most of the individual director districts cross
county boundaries. In addition, the daily activities of the RTD are administered by the General
Manager and eight department offices. The 2011 total operating budget was $377.2 million.
The single largest source of revenue to the District is the sales tax.

and
includes
40
municipalities and all or parts of eight
counties: The City and County of
Denver, the City and County of
Broomfield, the counties of Boulder
and Jefferson, the western portions of
Adams and Arapahoe counties, the
northeastern portion of Douglas
County, and a very small portion of
Weld County annexed by Brighton,
Longmont and Erie.
More than 2.6 million people, or
approximately
55
percent
of
Colorado’s total population, reside
within the District.

The Colorado General Assembly created the Regional Transportation District (RTD) as a
political subdivision of the State in 1969. According to Section 32-9-102, C.R.S., the creation
of the RTD was intended to “promote the public health, safety, convenience, economy, and
welfare of the residents of the district and of the state of Colorado.”

RTD’s Family of Services

1. Local: Local routes provide service in higher density/urban areas. Due to urban grow th,
shifting boundaries, or District minimum ridership standards, these routes may also
cross through areas of low er density. These routes stop an average of every 600 feet
or no more than 1 or 2 blocks apart.
a. Limited: Limited routes provide service in higher density/urban areas, some
may even cross all of the metro area. Compared to Local routes, these routes
only make specific selected stops, usually high-volume transfer points or major
traffic intersections. This allow s for faster running times and for passengers to
reach their destination quicker than riding the Local route.
2. Express: Express routes provide service from high-transfer or high-density ridership
locations such as Park-n-Rides, to other points of high ridership such as the dow ntown
Denver stations. These routes only make selected stops on the outer parts of their
route. They collect passengers and then continue w ithout stopping to their final
destination.
3. Regional: Regional routes provide service from one urban/suburban area to another.
These routes run the majority of their route on major traffic corridors such as highw ays
or interstates. Regional service can act as a 'Local' route on the first part of a trip,
collecting passengers on its w ay through tow n to a Park-n-Ride or station. It can also
start at a Park-n-Ride or station and then continue w ithout any further stops to its final
destination.
4. Sky Ride: SkyRide buses depart from each SkyRide stop at least once an hour and as
frequently as every 15 minutes. SkyRide buses operate seven days a w eek, 365 days a
year.
5. Call-n-Ride: Call-n-Ride is an on-demand, personalized bus service that travels w ithin
select RTD service areas that do not meet the service standard to demand fixed route
service.
6. Light Rail: Light Rail lines generally provide transit service to the equivalent of Local
and Express bus service along a fixed guidew ay dedicated to Light Rail vehicles;
providing trips as long as 12 miles and as short as one city block.

In April of 2013, RTD w ill begin operation of a new fixed guidew ay in its vast transit netw ork,
the West Rail line; the first major opening in the FasTracks light rail expansion program.

The West Rail Line w ill be the first of six new rapid transit corridors to open as part of RTD's
comprehensive FasTracks expansion program. Once complete, FasTracks w ill provide 122
miles of commuter rail and light rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit, add 21,000 new parking
spaces, redevelop Union Station and redirect bus service to better connect the eight-county
District.
The West Rail Line (WRL), scheduled to open in April 2013, w ill provide 12.1 miles of high
capacity transit service betw een the Auraria Campus in dow ntow n Denver and the Jefferson
County Government Center in Golden. The WRL, part of the regional FasTracks plan, w ill
improve connectivity betw een dow ntow n Denver, Lakew ood, and Golden w ith frequent, high
quality transit service seven days a w eek.
Along w ith the implementation of the new LRT line, a restructured West Corridor bus netw ork
is necessary in order to ensure the integration of the West Corridor bus and rail services. The
West Corridor Service Plan proposes a restructured bus service netw ork capable of
maximizing ridership grow th w hile addressing the expanding mobility needs of West Corridor
communities. Previous service development efforts, existing market conditions, and existing
service performance are all important factors in the development of the service plan.
The West Corridor service area is roughly bounded to the east by dow ntow n Denver, the City
of Golden in the w est, 44th Avenue in the north, and Jew ell Avenue/Evans Avenue in the
south. Portions of Denver, Edgew ater, Lakeside, Lakew ood, M ountain View , Wheat Ridge,
and Golden comprise the impacted service area.

and governmental areas surrounding the West Line

•

establish convenient connections betw een Call-n-Ride, bus and rail service to
accommodate passenger travel patterns throughout the day.

•

Establish new W-Line light rail service w ithin the corridor.

Pursuant to RTD policy on service changes, the service plans for the implementation of the
West Light Rail Line and connecting transit netw ork are included herein. The primary
objectives of the West Corridor Service plan are to:
•

provide the appropriate level of service to the West Line Light Rail stations

The decrease in annual one-w ay trips reflects the elimination of routes duplicative of the new
West Rail Line service (e.g. Route 16Ltd and Express Routes 5X and 6X) and the objective to
truncate existing dow ntow n-based services at LRT stations, allow ing LRT and first mile/last

Title VI Equity Analysis

In order to comply with the FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, as mentioned above, RTD has
established a Major Service Change policy, a Disparate Impact policy and a
Disproportionate Burden policy. Each of these polices govern what service changes will be
evaluated and how those service changes will be evaluated. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. M ajor Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition
or reduction in the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve
(12) or more months. All major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis
which includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. Adverse Effect: is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service
which includes but is not limited to: elimination of a route, shortlining a route,
rerouting an existing route and an increase in headways. RTD shall consider
the degree of adverse effects, and analyze those effects, when planning
major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a
minority population 10% more or less than non-minority populations; this level of
impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect
a low -income population 10% more than non-low -income populations; this level of
impact is considered a disproportionate burden. A low -income population is a group of
households w ho are at or below 150% of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden,
RTD w ill consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD w ill then analyze the
modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate
burden.
The RTD Board of Directors approved each the Title VI Equity Analysis policies. The meeting
minutes from the RTD Board meetings in w hich the policies w ere review ed and approved are
attached.

Equity Analysis Methodology

1. Examination of Service Impacts: Using the definition of adverse effects, this step
involves a general identification of the adverse effects resulting from the proposed
service changes.
2. Population Base Selection and Data Collection: Based on the nature of the
proposed service changes, the most appropriate disparate impact or
disproportionate burden exists.
3. Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis:
a. Comparison of service impacts and adverse effects on minority populations
and non-minority populations, via maps and data tables which reveal any
disparate impacts.
b. Comparison of service impacts and adverse effects on low-income
populations and non-low-income populations, via maps and data tables which
reveal any disproportionate burden.
c. Identification and evaluation of opportunities to avoid, minimize or mitigate
any disparate impacts or disproportionate burdens.

The opening of the WRL is considered a new fixed guideway system; therefore RTD has
conducted an assessment of the service impacts of all routes affected by the opening of the
WRL for adverse effects, even if the service change is not considered to be “Major” (per the
Major Service Change Policy). The step-by-step process used to assess the service
changes proposed in the West Corridor Service plan for a disparate impact or
disproportionate burden is as follows:

Page 13
Packet Pg. 337

1.B.3.b

In the exploration of w hich population base to utilize for the analysis, RTD explored the tw o
most viable options: Ridership data and Census data. Initially, available ridership data from the
most recent customer satisfaction survey w as review ed to determine if data provided the
level of detail necessary to complete the analysis. Unfortunately, w e found that on a route by
route basis, the data from the survey did have a large enough sample size to be considered
truly reflective of the actual ridership. After discussing this issue w ith our Regional FTA Civil
Rights Officer, RTD chose to utilize census data to complete this analysis.
The opening of the West Rail Line w ill dramatically increase service to the w est corridor, thus
affecting most w est corridor routes w ithin RTD’s Family of Services. The nature of the
changes include, but are not limited to route creation, rerouting, route merging,
increases/reductions in span of service, increases/reductions in trip frequency and route
discontinuance. Overall the West Corridor Service Plan has resulted in 37 route changes; less
than half of w hich (17) meet the major service change threshold.
The 37 service changes, the nature of their service changes and demographic data from the
2010 Census within proximity to those routes are listed in Table 3 and Table 4. All routes with
geographical changes or additions to routes are included in Appendix B.

As required per RTD Equity Analysis policies, service changes that created adverse effects
were examined for disparate impacts on minority populations and disproportionate burdens
on low-income populations. As defined in RTD’s Major Service Change Policy, an adverse
effect is a geographical or temporal reduction in service which includes but is not limited to:
elimination of a route, shortlining a route, rerouting an existing route and an increase in
headways. In the case of the West Corridor Service Plan, we find a significant increase in
service for a service area with a high demand for mass transit
The West Corridor Service plan (see appendix) reflects the customization of bus service to
accommodate the major addition of the West Rail Line. In general, the vast majority of the
changes made to each route were made to allow passengers to take full advantage of the
benefits provided by the West Rail Line. Additionally, under-performing routes are
proposed to endure changes that optimize their performance in accordance with service
standards. These facts were observed by way of analyzing each change, starting with
those changes with greatest potential for adverse effects.

Discontinued Routes
In examining the proposed changes of West Corridor Service Plan for adverse effects, RTD
examined the changes with greatest potential for adverse effects first, discontinued routes.
RTD takes a very cautious approach to route or route segment discontinuance, as this type
of service change typically offers the most adverse effect to riders. In fact, discontinued
routes or route segments are typically recommended for discontinuation due to low
performance or duplication with other services. As it relates to the West Corridor,
resources previously allocated to discontinued services are reinvested to other services as
part of the service plan. The routes to be discontinued are:
1. Local Route
a. 16 Limited (16L)
2. Express Routes
a. 2X
b. 5X
c. 6X
d. 87X

New Routes and Rerouting
New routes and rerouting of fixed route bus service proposed in the West Corridor Service
Plan is an exhibition of the follow ing intentions:
•

Improve service headw ays to foster spontaneous-use travel and improve frequent grid
transfer connections to LRT service.

•

Introduce additional Limited stop service on major corridors to offer more competitive
travel times and facilitate rapid commute-based LRT travel.

•

Improve midday service levels to provide additional spontaneous use of transit options
for all-day trip purposes.

These intentions are achieved equitably w ith each route, resulting in a net impact (new
routing impact – current routing impact = net impact) that is less than - 3% in the case of each
individual rerouting. The net impact that equates to a negative percentage w ould reflect an
adverse effect (e.g. -3% ), w hereas positive percentage reflects a service enhancement.

Each of these routes currently operates within approximately half of a mile of the West Rail
Line (see maps). Specifically, the 16L is a local bus route which traverses West Colfax
operating parallel to the West Rail Line. With a comparative amount of stops and a higher
service frequency operating within a ½ mile of the 16L, the West Rail Line will effectively
replace this service from Lakewood to Downtown Denver. the of at each of these routes
are used to commute downtown Rail Line or combination of the West Rail Line and other
bus services, including fixed route and RTD’s Call-n-Ride Service.

Additionally, each new route or new Call-n-Ride service is replacing a truncated or
discontinued route to maintain service levels as required per RTD service standards (detailed
in the West Corridor Service Plan).

Schedule Adjustments
The proposed schedule adjustments of various bus routes are generally minor changes made
to allow for on-time performance and connection w ith the West Rail Line; yielding no adverse
effects.

A side-by-side comparison of service changes provides an illustration of route optimization
rather than arbitrary implementation of a new fixed guidew ay. This methodology of tailoring
service to fit the transit demand w ith the intent to maintain current service levels has allow ed
RTD to avoid any disparate impacts to minority or disproportionate burdens on low -income
populations. Overall, the impact of the w est corridor service plan results in a significant
service enhancement for all riders of the w est Denver M etro Area. Thus this analysis of the
Proposed West Corridor Service Plans finds the proposed service changes do not result
disparate impacts on minority populations or disproportionate burdens on low -income
populations compared to RTD’s service area at large.

Final West Corridor Service Plan 2013

1 Introduction
Background & Focus

The West Corridor’s Light Rail Transit (LRT) line, scheduled to open in April 2013, will provide
12.1 miles of high capacity transit service between the Auraria Campus in downtown Denver
and the Jefferson County Government Center in Golden. The West Rail Line, part of the
regional FasTracks plan, will improve connectivity between downtown Denver, Lakewood, and
Golden with frequent, high quality transit service seven days a week.
Along with the implementation of the new LRT line, a restructured West Corridor bus network is
necessary in order to ensure the integration of West Corridor bus and rail services. The West
Corridor Service Plan proposes a restructured bus service network capable of maximizing
ridership growth while addressing the expanding mobility needs of West Corridor communities.
Previous service development efforts, existing market conditions, and existing service
performance are all important factors in the development of the service plan.
The West Corridor service area is roughly bounded to the east by downtown Denver, the City of
Golden in the west, 44th Avenue in the north, and Jewell Avenue/Evans Avenue in the south.
Portions of Denver, Edgewater, Lakeside, Lakewood, Mountain View, Wheat Ridge, and Golden
comprise the study area.

Service changes resulting from budget and demographic factors

The EIS developed for the West Corridor LRT project included a bus and rail operations plan.
Key planning concepts from the EIS include:
•
•
•
•

Elimination of 16Ltd service on Colfax Avenue due to duplication of the new LRT line.
Through-routing of Rtes 30 and 31 on Federal Boulevard, providing improved service
frequencies.
Addition of several new Limited routes (e.g. Rtes 31Ltd, 76Ltd).
Several Express routes are completely eliminated due to duplication of the new LRT line.
The remaining Express routes are truncated and converted to rail station feeder routes.

1.2.2 2007 West Corridor Transit Plan
The 2007 West Corridor Transit Plan reviewed West Corridor transit services and developed
bus service recommendations. The plan included a transit market assessment and a
performance review of the current route network in the region. Key planning concepts from the
2007 West Corridor Transit Plan include:
•
•
•
•

Rte 16Ltd is reconfigured to operate, with a shortened alignment from Golden to Federal
Center Station/Oak Street Station.
Elimination of all Express routes due to duplication of new LRT line and low productivity.
Truncate Regional routes at Federal Center Station, providing a two-seat trip into
downtown Denver.
Restructured Federal Boulevard service – decreased frequency on Rte 30, discontinue
Rte 30 trips south of Federal/Evans, operate all trips to Front Range Community College
on Rte 31, introduce new Rte 33 between Westminster Mall and Gold Line.

1.2.3 Lessons Learned from Previous RTD LRT Corridor Implementations
RTD has experienced past successes while restructuring bus networks around newly
implemented rail corridors. Specifically, the Southeast LRT Corridor offered many useful
lessons:
•
•

Restructuring the bus route network to support the new rail line increased bus ridership
and created a stronger bus network.
call-n-Rides provide a viable first/last mile service option in lieu of fixed route service,
particularly in suburban markets. Some of RTD’s strongest call-n-Rides operate within
the Southeast Corridor and were implemented in conjunction with LRT in the Southeast
Corridor. The RTD 2008 call-n-Ride Customer Satisfaction & Travel Characteristics
market survey suggests call-n-Ride services have changed the predominant pattern to
work commute-base trips when compared to services operated prior to the
implementation of LRT.

•

park-n-Rides experienced great success in suburban market areas, demonstrating
RTD’s ability to build a network with automobiles rather than around automobiles. A
number of park-n-Ride facilities adjacent to the rail lines operate in excess of 95%
capacity.
Fixed route services proved to be unsustainable in some low density regions. Fixed
route services operating within the Denver Tech Center and surrounding communities
experienced poor performance due to low residential densities, poor access, and the
desire for a more direct connection to rail service for travel patterns that fluctuate
throughout the day.
Directness of service is important in reconfiguring the bus network. It is important to
consider alternative bus-only direct routes to downtown, particularly when trips require
very long travel times. Rte P, for example, provides a lengthy one-seat ride into
downtown where the rail-feeder travel model is less attractive.
It is important to establish guiding principles and a framework for change as has been
done in prior corridors implementation studies.

2 Current Transit Market Assessment
Analyzing and understanding the current West Corridor transit market is an integral part of the
RTD West Corridor Preliminary Draft Service Plan. This market assessment will offer a market
context for the performance of the existing RTD network within the West Corridor and highlight
opportunities for RTD to continue to grow ridership.
An analysis of the following population characteristics helps identify densities of population and
employment segments more oriented towards transit use.
These include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Population and Employment Density
Youth Population
College-Aged Population
Senior Population
Physically Disabled Population
Economically Challenged
Vehicle Access

Data used in the analysis includes 2000 Census and 2005 estimates of population and
employment density developed by DRCOG. The following highlights the assessment that a
background report provides in more detail.

2.1

Population Density 2005

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

Final West Corridor Service Plan 2013

Typically, higher population densities are more supportive of transit usage. In the West Corridor
service area, high population densities are largely concentrated within the cities of Denver,
Lakewood, and Golden (Map 1). The majority of density is focused along the Colfax Avenue,
Printed December 4, 2012

Packet Pg. 350

1.B.3.b

Final West Corridor Service Plan 2013

Wadsworth Boulevard represents a clear transition from urban to suburban/exurban
development in the West Corridor. East of Wadsworth Boulevard, population densities
consistently measure above 15 people per acre and increase to above 24 people per acre
closer to downtown Denver. Conversely, west of Wadsworth Boulevard, development becomes
increasingly dispersed, with most neighborhoods measuring below 15 people per acre. Some
isolated pockets measure above 36 people per acre, but they lack continuity with the nearby
urban environment. Many neighborhoods in the western portion of the study area also lack the
basic pedestrian amenities necessary to support an urban transit network (e.g. sidewalks). The
nodal development west of Wadsworth Boulevard differs drastically from the corridor-based
development typical of communities closer to downtown Denver, particularly when considering
suitable transit service options.

2.2

Employment Density 2005

Areas displaying high employment density are significant trip generators for RTD passengers.
Typically, high employment densities are concentrated in Denver, Golden, and Lakewood (Map
1):
•

•

•

Denver With over 100,000 employees, downtown Denver represents the highest
concentration of workers served by the West Corridor. Downtown jobs are generated by
major government, commercial, retail, and entertainment employers. Outside of
downtown, high levels of retail and commercial employment occurs along the Colfax
Avenue and Federal Boulevard corridors. Significant employment density also exists
southwest of downtown where numerous manufacturing, industrial, and retail employers
are located.
Lakewood Significant employment densities exist along the Colfax Avenue, Wadsworth
Avenue, and Jewell Avenue corridors in Lakewood, supported by the Lakewood
Commons/Belmar shopping centers, the Jewell Square Shopping Center, the Colorado
Mills Shopping Center, and other major retail centers. High employment density is also
found along Union Boulevard, surrounding the Denver Federal Center. The Federal
Center employs a significant concentration of federal employees, with over 6,000
employees on site. The newly relocated St. Anthony’s Hospital is also located on the
Federal Center site. On the western edge of Lakewood, the Denver West Office Park
generates over 36 employees per acre.
Golden Dense employment in Golden is largely located in downtown along the
Washington Avenue corridor. The Colorado School of Mines, New Global Telecom,
CoorsTek, and the USGS National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) are each
found along this corridor. Southeast of downtown Golden, the Jeffco Government
Center, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and Denver West Marriot also
contribute to the high employment density in the area.

Federal Boulevard, Alameda Parkway, and Washington Avenue (Golden) corridors. These
densities are supported by the presence of various large apartment complexes, nearby
colleges, and the proximity of major employment centers.

3 Current Service Evaluation
Transit Route Network

The West Corridor is served predominantly by Central Business District (CBD) and Urban Local
services along major arterials (Figure 2). Corridors with high commute demand (Colfax Avenue,
Federal Boulevard, and 44th Avenue) were supplemented with peak-only Limited overlays in
addition to the underlying Local service. CBD Local and Limited routes provide direct, one-seat
trips into downtown Denver, while Urban Local routes provide connections to the greater RTD
network outside of downtown. Suburban Local routes offer fixed route transit coverage to some
of the less developed communities in the far reaches of the West Corridor. Express and
Regional routes provide peak-only service between West Corridor communities, outlying
communities, and employment centers in downtown Denver and the Denver Federal Center via
US-6.
skyRide service provides a one-seat ride from the West Corridor to the Denver
International Airport and downtown Denver.

3.2

Transit Service Levels

Table 2 - Current West Corridor Transit Route Network and Map 2 both display current West
Corridor combined peak frequencies by corridor. Each illustrates how service levels are
designed to best meet market demand.
Service frequencies in the West Corridor are designed to match the varying market demand
within the study area, from urban to suburban to exurban. The strongest high frequency
corridors operate on major urban roads closer to downtown, while more tailored, less frequent
services are provided to suburban and exurban areas with more limited transit demand further
west. This service design effectively creates a high-frequency, spontaneous use grid network
west of downtown Denver to Wadsworth Boulevard, with more focused, less-frequent nodal
services providing coverage west of Wadsworth Boulevard. The abundance of peak-only
Express services in the southwest portion of Lakewood is representative of the commuteoriented transit market typical of the outlying West Corridor communities. Conversely, within the
core network, frequent all-day services operate on major urban arterials (e.g. Colfax and
Federal) to facilitate all-day spontaneous use travel.
Table 2 - Current West Corridor Transit Route Network provides additional detail giving the
service class, description, peak and off-peak frequencies, and service span for all routes
considered a part of the West Corridor bus route network.

Transit Passenger Facilities

RTD currently provides numerous transit passenger facilities throughout the system including
rail stations, transfer centers, and park-n-Rides. Such facilities assist passengers in traveling
throughout the metro area by providing connections to multiple RTD services. Existing transit
passenger facilities within the West Corridor service area include transfer centers and a park-nRide:

Table 3 - Transit Passenger Facilities

With the implementation of LRT, 11 new stations will enter operation in the West Corridor. The
rail stations will have a significant impact on existing passenger facilities, particularly at the Cold
Spring park-n-Ride and Federal/Colfax transfer center.
•

•

3.4

Cold Spring park-n-Ride is replaced by a major bus-to-rail transfer point at the new
Federal Center Station, while still providing park-n-Ride capacity for commuters traveling
into downtown Denver.
Passenger operations at the Federal/Colfax Transfer Center will shift to the new
Decatur-Federal rail station, incurring significant operational changes for routes utilizing
the center. The transfer center will be retained as a support facility for the many
services converging on the Decatur-Federal Station.

Ridership

Local and Limited routes average weekday passenger boardings total 56,001 within the West
Corridor. West Corridor Express and Regional services generate 1,184 and 3,374 boardings,
respectively. Map 3 displays the average weekday boardings by individual stop.

Final West Corridor Service Plan 2013
3.4.1 Ridership Patterns

Boarding activity (Map 3) in the West Corridor is largely concentrated in the core grid network
from downtown Denver to Wadsworth Boulevard. In the core grid, frequent bus services allow
for linear travel along corridors in addition to travel throughout the greater RTD network via
transfers between frequent grid connections. Colfax Avenue and Federal Boulevard generate
the greatest volumes of boarding activity in the core grid network, aided by the frequent
connections provided at the Federal/Colfax transfer center. These corridors typically have much
higher population and employment densities with well-connected street patterns, demonstrating
that densities and street patterns significantly impact transit’s success in communities.
West of Wadsworth Boulevard, ridership patterns become increasingly nodal as major boarding
activity occurs almost entirely at a few isolated hubs. Concentrations of boarding activity occur
at locations where connections to the core grid network are available, including Cold Spring
park-n-Ride (Federal Center Station), Applewood Village transfer center, and downtown Golden.
This nodal focus emerges as population densities grow smaller and transit services become
more tailored to better connect suburban markets with transfer links to the greater network.
Subsidy per Boarding by Route
Subsidy per boarding measures the financial effectiveness of a route by comparing the
performance of a route (boardings) against the net cost incurred upon RTD to operate the route
(subsidy). Routes displaying low subsidy per boardings combine efficient and effective service
with higher ridership generation.
Figure 1 - Subsidy per Boarding below displays weekday subsidy per boarding for all West
Corridor routes. The top performers in terms of subsidy per boarding strongly correlate with
those displaying the highest level of productivity: Rtes 30, 16, 36Ltd, and 16Ltd. The most
financially effective routes operate in the core grid network and require well below $3.00 in
subsidy per boarding. More costly services, including most Express and Regional routes,

3.4.2 Subarea Analysis
In order to gain a better understanding of the differentiation in Local and Limited service
performance throughout the West Corridor, the service area has been segmented into three
geographic subareas for a more detailed analysis:
•
•
•

Inner Segment – Downtown Denver to Sheridan Boulevard
Middle Segment – Sheridan Boulevard to Kipling Street
Outer Segment – Kipling Street to Golden

These subareas were segmented in relation to population and employment densities, major
ridership patterns within the West Corridor, and changing development patterns.

Inner Segment – Generates 65 percent of Local and Limited weekday ridership in the
West Corridor:
o Major ridership generators include Rtes 16, 30, 31, and 51
o Over 36,600 daily boardings in the inner segment
Middle Segment – Generates 23 percent of Local and Limited weekday ridership in the
West Corridor:
o Major ridership generators include Rtes 16, 16Ltd, and 76
o Over 13,000 daily boardings in the middle segment
Outer Segment – Generates 11 percent of Local and Limited weekday ridership in the
West Corridor:
o Major ridership generators include Rtes 17 and 100
o Over 6,000 daily boardings in the outer segment

The majority of West Corridor boarding activity occurs within the inner and middle segments,
where the grid network provides higher frequencies, including spontaneous use frequencies
along major corridors. Further west in the outer segment, where bus service fulfills more of a
coverage role, boarding activity accounts for just 11 percent of the overall West Corridor
boarding activity. This significant decrease in boarding activity suggests an opportunity for
alternative service delivery methods besides fixed route. Resource savings can be reinvested in
the core grid network, benefitting a majority of West Corridor RTD passengers.

Productivity by Subarea
Boardings per in-service hour by subarea indicate how well RTD is matching transit service
levels to varying market performance. While many West Corridor routes are operating within
RTD service performance standards, certain segments of these routes perform well below the
standards.

Inner Segment – Displays the strongest productivity with a Local and Limited weekday
average of 47 passenger boardings per revenue hour.
o Local Rtes 3, 30, and 21 and Limited Rte 16L each experience 60 or greater
boardings per revenue hour in the subarea.
Middle Segment – Experiences moderate productivity with a Local and Limited weekday
average of 36 passenger boardings per revenue hour in the subarea.
o Local Rte 16 and Limited Rte 16L each show greater than 60 passenger boardings
per revenue hour in the subarea.

Local Rte 16, Limited Rte 16L, and Local Rte 38 each display 30 or greater
passenger boardings per revenue hour in the subarea.

East-west routes operating along secondary corridors (e.g. Rtes 20, 28, 32, and 44) display the
lowest productivity in each market subarea, particularly in the outer segment where they
measure below 20 boardings per revenue hour. The substantial decrease in productivity for
these routes compared to their respective inner and outer segments suggests that the outer
segments should be reevaluated for alternative service options.
Generally, RTD provides appropriate transit service levels relative to the performance in each
subarea. Compared to the wide range of total boardings generated in each subarea, segment
productivity experiences significantly less differentiation. For example, the inner segment
generates nearly twice the boardings as the middle segment, while only displaying 30 percent
greater boardings per revenue hour.

Current Conditions Summary

The West Corridor is typified by a core grid network west of downtown to Wadsworth Boulevard
comprised of Local and Limited services providing spontaneous-use frequencies. The grid
network extends west of Wadsworth Boulevard, but displays significantly decreased
performance. Routes west of Wadsworth Boulevard operate less frequently and are more
tailored to commute-based demand.
•

•

•
•

•

•

West Corridor level of service changes and adapts based on the market densities within
the service area, shifting from high density urban development to dispersed, lower
density suburban and exurban development.
Boardings in the West Corridor are largely concentrated in the core grid network from
downtown Denver to Wadsworth Boulevard. West of Wadsworth Boulevard, boardings
become more nodal, occurring almost entirely at isolated connections with the grid
network.
Key activity corridors include Federal Boulevard, Colfax Avenue, Sheridan Boulevard,
Wadsworth Boulevard, and Alameda Avenue.
Weekday boardings are greatest on Rtes 31, 16, 21, 30, and 76. Each experiences
5,000 or more boardings per day and operates on major corridors within the grid
network.
Weekday productivity is highest on Rtes 30, 16, 16L, 31, and 30L. Each displays
greater than 45 passenger boardings per revenue hour and operates on major corridors
within the core grid network.
The inner segment subarea generates the majority of West Corridor weekday ridership
and displays the highest productivity, warranting the highest level of resource
investment. Ridership and productivity significantly decrease on route segments to the
west, particularly on routes operating on secondary corridors in the outer segment.

4 LRT W-Line
The planned West Rail Line will provide high capacity transit service between downtown Denver
and the Jefferson County Government Center. The West Corridor Service Plan will develop a
comprehensive bus network capable of a seamless integration with the LRT service.

5 Proposed Service Plan
Key Planning Principles

The West Corridor plan is based on the following guiding principles. Map 4 illustrates the
service planning concepts.
• Develop a bus network that will effectively integrate with the new West Corridor
LRT line. Given the significant investment in high capacity West Corridor LRT service,
the service plan aims to orient the supporting West Corridor bus network around the LRT
line. A key aspect of this approach is to encourage line haul travel on LRT, while
supplying/distributing riders from LRT stations with improved local and community bus
and call-n-Ride services.
• Reinvest available resources towards service improvements in the core grid
network. After the implementation of LRT, core grid services will comprise the
underlying support network in the West Corridor. Recognizing additional transit demand
(both LRT and bus) generated by the future rail line, improving service levels and
capacity along major grid corridors is necessary to accommodate the growing transit
market and to foster spontaneous use of the integrated bus and LRT network. Figure
5.1 displays conceptual frequencies for routes operating in the West Corridor.
• Rationalize service to optimize available resources.
Market and service
performance analyses illustrated where West Corridor bus services are most successful
and well-utilized. Focusing available resources for improvements on these segments
ensures that RTD will experience maximum ridership per resource provided.
• Align service with current market demand and implement demand response
service delivery models where appropriate.
In the Southeast Corridor
implementation, RTD has experienced success with the introduction of flexible low-cost
service delivery options in low demand markets (e.g. call-n-Ride service). Given the low
demand nature of significant portions of the West Corridor service area, introducing calln-Ride services allows RTD to maintain transit service coverage in low-demand areas
more cost-effectively than operating regular fixed route service
• Restructure long distance trips to utilize LRT. Replacing long distance one seat trips
with a combination of line haul LRT and short first mile/last mile bus services service
offers benefits to both RTD and RTD riders. Replacing existing Express services allows
for the operation of more cost-effective short range services for first mile/last mile pickup/distribution, while concentrating the trunk line portion of trips on high-capacity LRT.
Depending on their destinations, riders should experience improved travel times and
enhanced schedule reliability, as LRT’s exclusive right-of-way allows vehicles to bypass
freeway traffic congestion that typically impedes highway-based bus services. This
approach worked to successfully grow overall ridership in similar circumstances when
LRT was introduced in the Southeast Corridor.

Maintain the quality of service for RTD customers. The service plan aims to
increase opportunities to spontaneously use the integrated system, minimize the number
of transfers required to complete a trip, provide comparable or improved travel times
from existing services, and provide access to major destinations throughout the service
area.
Integrate future West Corridor bus services with FastConnects timed transfer
hubs. FastConnects hubs use timed transfers where transit services are specifically
scheduled in order to minimize passenger wait time for connecting services. Several
FastConnects hubs are located in the West Corridor area, including Federal/Evans
Transfer Center, Lakewood Commons, Federal Center Station, Jeffco Government
Center-Golden Station, and Applewood Transit Center. The proposed West Corridor
bus network will utilize these FastConnects hubs to facilitate regional travel through
timed transfer connections.

West Corridor Bus Service Recommendations

West Corridor bus service recommendations are based on previous West Corridor planning
efforts and additional market and service analyses. The following recommendations were
developed with the intention to fulfill the guiding principles and enhance mobility in the West
Corridor upon the implementation of LRT service.
The recommendations are presented in three sections based on their respective network roles:
•
•
•

North-South Route Recommendations
East-West Route Recommendations
Demand Response Service Recommendations

Table 8 - Service Design Strategies summarizes the service design strategies for the proposed
West Corridor bus network. Map 5 provides an overview of proposed bus and call-n-Ride
services. It shows all portions of discontinued bus service in black, much of which is replaced by
call-n-Ride. The following by Maps 6, 7 and 8 provide close-ups of the three segments.

Final West Corridor Service Plan 2013

With LRT serving as the structural spine in the West Corridor, connecting north-south routes will
provide the underlying support network for the collection and distribution of LRT riders
throughout West Corridor communities. The performance of LRT will be directly related to the
effectiveness of these intersecting bus routes; as such, the plan utilizes the following service
design strategies to ensure strong north-south connections:
•
•
•
•
•

Improve service headways to foster spontaneous-use travel and improve frequent grid
transfer connections to LRT service.
Introduce additional Limited stop service on major corridors to offer more competitive
travel times and facilitate rapid commute-based LRT travel.
Improve midday service levels to provide additional spontaneous use of transit options
for all-day trip purposes.
Transition any east-west route segments to new LRT trips where appropriate.
Design improvements to smoothly fit with future Gold Line connections.

Rte 50 Lakes Crosstown - Would connect with the West Line at Sheridan Station. Service
would operate between Bear Valley and Old Town Arvada, via Sheridan Boulevard, West 44th
Avenue, Lakeside, Harlan Street, West 48th Avenue, Marshall Street, West 52nd Avenue, Vance
Street, Wadsworth Boulevard, and into Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride for transfer connections.
It would operate weekdays every 30 minutes between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m., coordinated with Rte
51 schedules to equal a 15-minute frequency on the common portions through Denver,
Lakewood, Edgewater, Mountain View and Lakeside.
Rte 51 Sheridan Crosstown – Maintain existing 30 minute service along current alignment with
improved 15 minute short line service between 48th Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue as
described in Rte 50. Rte 51 currently displays strong productivity of nearly 40 passenger
boardings per revenue hour and warrants additional investment for service improvements.
Following the introduction of LRT service, the short line segment is expected to generate
significant additional demand on Sheridan Boulevard. Service hours are proposed to be
extended till 12:30 a.m. on the central portion of the route.
Rte 76 Wadsworth Crosstown – Maintain existing local service and introduce a new service
overlay operating between Olde Town Arvada and Wadsworth & Hampden park-n-Ride. The
new Rte 76 pattern is proposed to operate every 30 minutes during peak periods, effectively
providing a combined 15 minute peak frequency along Wadsworth Boulevard. This routing and
the operation of peak direction Rte 30Ltd trips via Estes Street and Yale Avenue would replace
Rte 87X.
The local route currently displays strong productivity (nearly 40 passenger boardings per hour)
and warrants increased levels of service, particularly with the expectation of additional demand
from LRT at Wadsworth Station and further along in the FasTracks program, the Gold Line.
Initially, this is to be provided by extensions of Rte 14 to Lakewood Commons via Belmar and
Wadsworth and Rte 28 from West 26th & Wadsworth to Lakewood-Wadsworth Station. Service

Final West Corridor Service Plan 2013

Rte 100 Kipling Crosstown – Would connect with the West Line at Federal Center Station and
at Oak Station. It would travel the existing alignment north of Colfax Avenue and south of
Mississippi Avenue. The central portion of the route would be realigned to continue from
Mississippi Avenue via Garrison Street to Alameda Avenue, Routt Street, looping through the
Federal Center Station, West 4th Avenue, Union Boulevard, West 8th Avenue, looping through
Oak Station, and back to the current route on Kipling. Other changes proposed are to run the
same route on Saturdays via the Ridge Road campus as on weekdays, providing 30-minute
frequencies through the day on weekdays, and providing hourly service on weeknight evenings
during typical shopping hours with the last trip in each direction departing Federal Center
Station after 10 p.m.
A school tripper, identified as Rte 100W, would serve Lakewood High School and commuters
southbound from Westminster Center park-n-Ride in the morning to Federal Center Station via
Kipling Street, West 6th Avenue Service Road, Parfet Street, West 8th Avenue and then on the
regular route. A return trip would be provided over the reverse route after school. The school
would also be served by the Belmar call-n-Ride.
Federal Boulevard
Current bus operations on Federal Boulevard consist of two local routes: Rte 30 South Federal
and Rte 31 North Federal and two Limited routes: Rte 30Ltd South Federal Limited and Rte
36Ltd Littleton via Ft. Logan Limited operating within the West Corridor study area. Two
additional local routes: Rte 29 Riverbend and Rte 36 Fort Logan operate south of the West
Corridor study area in the Sheridan/Littleton area. The service plan streamlines operations and
will provide direct connections to LRT and Downtown Denver bus service at Decatur/Federal
Station.
Rtes 30 and 31 are proposed to be coordinated to form a single Federal Boulevard Crosstown
service. The combined routes will operate with a 7½- minute average frequency between
Federal/Evans Transfer Center and Federal/Colfax. All trips terminating southbound at Evans
would be designated as Rte 31. The Rte 31 will continue north from Colfax with 30-minute
service extending to Front Range Community College and Westminster Center park-n-Ride
each, for a combined 15-minute frequency. The Rte 30 designation will identify trips terminating
in the Colfax & Federal Transfer Center or at the Wadsworth & Hampden park-n-Ride. Rtes 30
and 31 would make the same stops northbound and southbound at Decatur/Federal Station.
Rte 30 trips southwest of Federal/Evans would be provided middays, Saturdays, and in the
reverse peak direction on weekdays.
Limited Rtes 30Ltd and 36Ltd will maintain current operations, providing peak commuters with a
one-seat ride into downtown Denver from South Federal Boulevard, Bear Valley, and South
Lowell Boulevard. These routes will provide a distributor alternative for West Rail Line
customers oriented toward the center of Downtown Denver at times of high demand. Peak
period service on South Federal Boulevard will operate at combined average 5 minute

summarized in Table 10 - Federal Boulevard Service Resource Requirements Comparison,
which shows service levels when schools are in session. Tables 12 and 13 show service levels
when schools are not in session, which will be the case for opening of the West Line. Rte 30Ltd

5.2.2 East-West Routes Recommendations
Once completed, the West Corridor LRT will attract the majority of east-west line haul travel into
downtown Denver, deemphasizing the need for high capacity east-west bus routes in the West
Corridor. As line haul travel transitions to LRT service, east-west bus routes in the West
Corridor will function primarily for local trip needs and network completion.
Bus service on Colfax Avenue will consist of the existing Rte 16 West Colfax Avenue operating
every 15 minutes to Oak Station, with every other trip serving Golden throughout the day.
Connections to LRT will be available for all trips at Oak Station. Additional Rte 16 trips will be
provided between Decatur/Federal Station as needed to maintain connections between the
Denver Civic Center and West Rail Line points.
Rte 16Ltd West Colfax Limited is proposed for discontinuation due to duplication with the
future LRT line, as LRT is expected to attract a large amount of the existing Rte 16Ltd line-haul
travel into downtown. Midday weekday and weekend service into Golden previously provided
by Rte 16Ltd will be provided by Rte 16 every 30 minutes.
A key guiding principle for the service plan includes replacing unproductive east-west route
segments with more cost-effective service delivery options. Generally, the performance of eastwest routes drops significantly west of Wadsworth Boulevard, marking a clear transition from the
robust core grid network to limited demand markets. In these instances, the service plan
recommends truncating routes at Wadsworth Boulevard (similar to current weekend operations)
and introducing call-n-Ride services to replace discontinued unproductive route segments.

Rte 9 West 10th Avenue segments west of Wadsworth Boulevard; replaced by Belmar
call-n-Ride. Midday service would be improved to every 30 minutes, permitting
interlining with Rte 28 and better connections with W-Line light rail service at Lamar
Station and Lakewood-Wadsworth Station.
Rte 14 West Florida segments; replaced by Green Mountain and Belmar call-n-Rides.
Weekday service extended to Lakewood Commons via Belmar.

Rte 21 Evans Crosstown (west of Union Boulevard) segments; replaced by Green
Mountain call-n-Ride.
Rte 28 28th Ave segments; replaced by Rte 26 West 26th Avenue west of Wadsworth
Boulevard. Daytime service on both routes extended along Wadsworth to LakewoodWadsworth Station and Lakewood Commons. Rte 26 would include two morning and
two afternoon peak trips extended to serve the area west of Youngfield to Eldridge on
schedules timed for 7:30 and 8:00 a.m. work starting times and 4:30 and 5:00 p.m. work
quitting times.
Rte 32 32nd Ave / City Park no change. Access to the West Line is provided by parallel
Rtes 26 and 28.

Other east-west route recommendations include:
•

•
•

•

•

•

Rte 1 West 1st Avenue would remain for access into central Downtown Denver, but
would no longer go through the Colfax & Federal Transfer Center. Its alignment would
be reviewed in 2014 after the relocation of connecting Market Street Station activity to
Union Station. Peak school trippers would be removed from the route, because the
Light Rail lines provide faster and more frequent service for the student travel patterns.
All Rte 3 Alameda Crosstown trips will be realigned to Federal Center Station via Union
Boulevard, discontinuing the low-performing Green Mountain pattern.
Rte 4 Morrison Road which only operated in peak hour periods (7 am trips, 8 pm trips)
and on 45 minute frequencies, was discontinued in January 2012 due to poor
performance (fewer than 10 passenger boardings per trip) and duplication of existing
local services. Westwood riders can utilize Rtes 3 and 11 for east-west connections to
Southwest Corridor LRT or frequent Rtes 30/31 and 50/51 for north-south connections
to West Corridor LRT.
Rte 14 West Florida weekday daytime trips will terminate at Lakewood Commons, with
Rte 21 replacing segments of local service to Federal Center via portions of the existing
Rte 14 alignment on Union Boulevard.
A portion of Rte 17 Jeffco will transition to a rail feeder service, connecting Red Rocks
Community College, and western Lakewood multi-family housing neighborhoods with
Federal Center Station.
Rte 20 20th Avenue short-turn trips that currently operate to and from the east at the
Colfax & Federal Transfer Center would be extended to Federal Boulevard, terminating
at 16th & Grove, in order to maintain connections.

The plan recommends that several routes maintain their current operations: Rte 11
Mississippi Crosstown, Rte 38 38th Avenue, Rte 44 44th Avenue.

5.2.3 Other Service Recommendations

An objective of the service plan is to truncate existing downtown-based services at LRT
stations, allowing LRT and “first mile”/”last mile” local bus services to provide long distance trip
completion:
•

•
•

•

•

•
•

Rte 2X Morrison/Alkire/Federal Center Express, Rte 5X Federal Center Express,
Rte 87X South Wadsworth Express, Rte 93X Green Mountain Express will not be
retained, with proposed local bus and call-n-Ride services providing first mile/last mile
LRT access to peak commuters. Rte 116Ltd would cover major stops of Rte 2X.
Portions of these routes’ patronage can be expected to switch to park-n-Ride
opportunities that are not presently available, or to Regional buses calling at Federal
Center Station.
Rte 6X Federal Center/I-25 & Broadway Express will be discontinued due to
duplication with more comprehensive LRT service.
Rte 100X South Kipling Express will be realigned to Federal Center Station as Rte
100Ltd South Kipling Limited, providing first mile access to LRT from Ken Caryl parkn-Ride and points on Kipling Street/Kipling Parkway.
Rte 116X South Simms Express will be realigned to Federal Center Station as Route
116Ltd South Simms Limited, providing first mile access to LRT from Ken Caryl parkn-Ride and points on Simms Street/Kipling Parkway. From C-470 to the Federal Center
Station, Rte 116Ltd would cover major stops of current Rte 2X.
A new Rte KC Regional service will be provided between Ken Caryl stops, the Ken Caryl
Park-n-Ride and Civic Center Station, calling at the Federal Center Station. Regional
fares will apply for through travel from Ken Caryl to Civic Center, with Express fares
applying to Federal Center Station stops.
Mountain Regional Rtes CS and ES would continue to serve Federal Center Station en
route to or from Civic Center Station.
Northern Regional Rte GS would continue to serve Federal Center Station, the Federal
Center, NREL and other currently covered segments of its route.

skyRide (airport) service
Earlier plans for the West Corridor assumed that Rte AF between Federal Center Station,
Downtown Denver and Denver International Airport would remain intact until opening of the
East/DIA commuter rail line. However, other assumptions, such as the earlier completion of
Union Station, closure of Market Street Station and traffic delays on US6 and I-70 were not
expected to occur during that time period. The revised plan calls for service to be discontinued
west of Downtown Denver, with a minor exception.

The basic route would begin at the Denver Bus Center, serve Market Street Station until it is
closed, serve Union Station at 17th & Chestnut Streets for Light Rail connections until the
underground bus concourse is opened, serve the underground bus concourse, enter the
freeway system via the 20th Street ramps and then continue on its regular route. The
westbound route would reverse this pattern. An exception is that a weekday trip would be
provided from Jeffco Government Center/Golden Station, Federal Center Station and through
Downtown Denver replacing the current first trip. That trip operates during hours when the WLine light rail service will not. On weekends and holidays, train service would be available from
those points to Rte AF connections at Union Station.
call-n-Rides
Based on successes from previous RTD rail corridor implementations, call-n-Ride services allow
for the provision of transit service in limited demand markets utilizing minimal resources. Given
their flexible service attributes, call-n-Ride services proposed in the West Corridor fulfill multiple
roles, including first mile/last mile trip completion with LRT stations and local circulation in
limited demand markets.
The Golden call-n-Ride will provide flexible service throughout Golden, including downtown
and the Jefferson County Government Center. The service will operate at times as a flex-route,
serving scheduled timepoints at downtown Golden, Jeffco Station, and various other key
community locations within the service area. In conjunction with RTD, Golden was recently
awarded a federal CMAQ grant to fund the Golden call-n-Ride service.
The Green Mountain call-n-Ride will operate at times as a flex-route with a scheduled
timepoint at Federal Center Station. The service will provide coverage to the area south of the
West Corridor rail line, west of Kipling Street, north of Jewell Avenue, east of Bear Creek
Boulevard/Alameda Avenue/Alkire Street. The call-n-Ride will cover discontinued portions of
local Rtes 3 and 21, while providing first mile/last mile service to Federal Center Station from
discontinued portions of Express Rtes 2X and 93X.
The Belmar call-n-Ride will provide coverage to the area south of the West Corridor rail line,
west of Wadsworth Boulevard, north of Jewell Avenue, east of Kipling Street. The call-n-Ride
will provide on-demand service with a scheduled time point at Wadsworth Station. The call-nRide will cover discontinued portions of Local Rtes 9 and 17, while providing first mile/last mile
service to Lakewood/Wadsworth Station from discontinued portions of Express Rtes 87X and
93X.
5.2.4 Discontinued Routes
Discontinued routes or route segments were typically recommended for discontinuation due to
low performance or duplication with other services. Resources previously allocated to these
discontinued services are reinvested to other West Corridor services as part of this service plan.
Almost all discontinued routes and route segments are either replaced by new demand
response service or are within walking distance of fixed route RTD service. Discontinued routes
are indicated in Table 12 - Proposed Service Resource Requirements.

Service Resource Impacts

The plan results in overall changes in RTD bus operations as compared with the May 2012
service:
•
•

An increase to 649,442 in-service hours on fixed and demand-responsive routes,
representing a 1 percent rise.
A peak vehicle requirement of 208 buses on fixed and demand-responsive routes,
representing a 5 percent reduction (9 buses).

The service plan incorporates several guiding principles, many of which have a significant
bearing on the resource requirements for the future West Corridor bus network:
•

•

•

The decrease in vehicles reflects the elimination of routes duplicative of LRT service
(e.g. Rte 16Ltd and Express Rtes 5X and 6X) and the objective to truncate existing
downtown-based services at LRT stations, allowing LRT and first mile/last mile local bus
services to provide long distance trip completion.
Many of the in-service hours and vehicles reinvested in the system appear in the form of
service improvements on the core grid network (e.g. Rtes 50/51, Rte 76, and Rte 100),
ensuring that LRT riders are effectively collected and distributed throughout West
Corridor communities.
The reduction in peak buses is a direct result of the replacement of unproductive eastwest route segments with more alternative and more cost-effective service delivery
options (i.e. call-n-Rides). Successes from previous RTD rail corridor implementations
show that call-and-Ride services allow for the provision of transit service in limited
demand markets utilizing minimal resources.

Final West Corridor Service Plan 2013

6 Ridership Estimation
Background

In the Preliminary Proposed West Corridor Service Plan prepared in 2011, consultants
Transportation Management & Design, Inc. developed a West Corridor network conforming to
the principles laid out in Section 5.1 of this report. Their report is the basis of this proposal, with
modifications made as a result of issues developed in the modeling process. Additional
changes were made for bus operational reasons and in response to suggestions from local
agencies, but these were not major revisions of the plan. In January 2012, annual in-service
hours in the West Corridor were reduced by one percent, but as the reductions concentrated on
lightly-used services, these did not cause major revisions in the plan.

6.2

Procedures and model results

For the purposes of this plan, ridership estimates were based on a modified version of the 2020
FasTracks Model. The proposed West Corridor bus and rail network was used as the
underlying transit network in the FasTracks model with the intention of projecting expected
ridership within the existing market parameters from the FasTracks model. Results for modified
model runs were within 3 percent of the original FasTracks model run. At the route level, results
were more varied due to the inherent characteristics associated with disaggregating the model
data itself and to changes in West Corridor bus services recommended by this plan. Table 14 Ridership & Productivity Comparison displays the current and projected boardings and
productivity for West Corridor routes. Model results from the West Corridor Plan Model indicate
that while bus productivity decreases from current levels, overall productivity (including LRT) is
expected to increase approximately 10 percent by 2020.
Generally, route level results are consistent with prior model runs. Differences in results are
relatively minor and largely reflected in small ridership allocations between bus and LRT. The
model results capture expected route level ridership reasonably well, with few exceptions:
Federal Boulevard Routes. Recommended changes to service on Federal Boulevard
resulted in a decrease in Local ridership attributed to the discontinuation of Rte 29 and
the Bear Valley portion of Rte 30, the replacement of Rte 36 with Rte 31, and the
reduction in service frequency along Federal Boulevard. These changes were removed
from the Proposed Plan due to operating complications.
Limited service boardings, however, are significantly lower than expected based on the
recommended West Corridor service plan. Currently, Rtes 30Ltd and 36Ltd generate
580 and 950 daily boardings, respectively. These results are significantly higher than
the results projected by the model but remain within the passenger capacity limits of the
current service.
Considering these routes are recommended to remain largely
unchanged, ridership is expected to increase from current levels along with overall bus
ridership in the area.

Final West Corridor Service Plan 2013

Colfax Avenue Routes. Ridership patterns on Colfax Avenue routes are expected to
change significantly with the implementation of LRT and the planned discontinuation of
Rte 16Ltd. Current Rte 16Ltd riders are expected to shift to Rte 16 and LRT; however,
the share of riders choosing one mode over the other is difficult to predict prior to the
service change. Additionally, some existing Rte 16 ridership will likely convert to LRT to
fulfill certain trip purposes. Some customers will use both Rte 16 and the West Rail Line
for specific needs.
North-South Routes. Generally, north-south routes with future connections to LRT are
expected to experience ridership gains following the implementation of LRT. The model
results support this assumption with moderate projected ridership gains on Rtes 50/51
and 76. Rte 100, however, is projected to more than double daily boardings in the
model results, despite experiencing a relatively minimal improvement to 30 minute allday frequency. While ridership is expected to increase, the gains are likely to be more
modest unless higher frequencies are implemented. The higher ridership forecast was
accommodated in the revised plan by insertion of Rte 100Ltd.
call-n-Rides. Modeling call-n-Ride ridership presented a unique challenge, considering
the FasTracks model is not designed to project non-fixed-route ridership. For the
purposes of this study, “proxy” call-n-Ride routes were created in the model, acting as
fixed-route substitutes covering the basic call-n-Ride service area.
The results for the Golden and Belmar call-n-Rides appear reasonable, as they are
within the general range of current RTD call-n-Ride ridership. Ridership for the Golden
call-n-Ride may in fact be closer to the 350 daily boardings as predicted in the Golden
Transit Feasibility Study. Conversely, the results for the Green Mountain and the thenproposed Applewood call-n-Ride ridership projections appear high, considering the most
productive current RTD call-n-Ride generates just 200 daily boardings. Ridership on
these call-n-Rides is more likely to be in the range of 200 to 400 daily boardings based
on the underlying market demand. The Green Mountain call-n-Ride may eventually
have potential to provide fixed-route first mile/last mile service depending on growth in
demand from LRT. Revisions to the plan were made for the Applewood area, replacing
a proposed call-n-Ride with continued conventional service on Rtes 20 and 32,
bracketing Flex-Ride service to be introduced with Rte 26.
In summary, the proposed network changes were successfully incorporated and tested
using the existing FasTracks model with the recommended West Corridor service
changes. Projected ridership resulting from the changes recommended in the West
Corridor plan is generally consistent with earlier model runs, with the West Corridor Plan
model run displaying results within 1 percent of the FasTracks model run. Similarly,
results for West Corridor routes from the West Corridor Plan Model produced results

Printed December 4, 2012

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

Consequently, on Rtes 30 and 31 service levels are adjusted to properly adapt to
changes in transfer patterns due to the bus-LRT transfer at the Federal-Decatur Station
and can be adjusted if ridership in the corridor increases more than projected.

Other Issues

7.2.1 ADA Coverage
Providers of regular route transit service are required to offer alternative service within a ¾- mile
radius of the regular service points for eligible customers with disabilities. A variety of details
are beyond the province of this report. However, a check of RTD access-a-Ride records
indicates that at present 53 customers of that service would no longer be covered due to the
proposed changes in regular routes. Proposed call-n-Ride services are able to serve 90% of
their locations. RTD’s access-a-Ride staff would work with the remaining individuals to
determine whether and how they would be covered.

Final West Corridor Service Plan 2013

Eight public meetings were held during the second half of April in order to obtain comments on
the proposed service plan for the West Corridor, including the West Rail Line (W-Line) and bus
and call-n-Ride services. 201 public participants offered their views or attended to ask
questions. Information from the hearings and additional field work was then taken into account
where resources permit and the plan was modified.
Additional meetings have been and will be held with local government officials and civic or
neighborhood groups as requested, with any other changes limited by resources and the
calendar in preparation for the service changes to take effect upon completion of construction,
testing and training on the West Rail Line.
7.2.3 West Corridor service changes public hearing summaries
Jeffco Government Center - Monday, April 16, 2012
The goal of retaining a one-seat ride on Rtes 100X and 116X drew the most interest from the 26
members of the public attending the Golden meeting. Participants felt that the proposed
alternatives were too slow and worried that adding a Regional Rte KC from the Ken Caryl area
would divide ridership up, rather than attracting customers. Two speakers, including Tim Young
(Jefferson County Human Services Manager for Child Services), expressed concern about the
proposed Golden call-n-Ride’s ability to handle the family traffic on the mile stretch between
their buildings and the light rail terminal. (Service is presently provided by Rte 17.)
Individuals expressed support for retaining a one-seat ride on Local Rte 9 from the area of the
Garrison Station to the Market Street Station vicinity, criticized the alignment of the Light Rail
line at Union Station, supported the alignment of the Light Rail line at Union Station and asked
neutral questions about changes proposed for Rte AF. Six RTD staff members attended the
meeting and answered numerous questions afterward.
Clements Community Center – Lakewood - Wednesday, April 18, 2012
The 52 members of the public who attended the Lakewood meeting represented diverse
interests. Common concerns were the proposed loss of direct bus service into Downtown on
Rtes 20, 28, 32 in the area to be covered by the Applewood call-n-Ride and expected
inadequacies in the call-n-Ride services for that area and replacing Rte 17 for the Jefferson
County Human Services complex. Division Director Lynnae Flora of the Jefferson County
Department of Human Services stated that the call-n-Ride will be inadequate to access their
campus. Two customers also spoke in favor of retaining Rte 100X as a one-seat ride to Civic
Center Station.
Individuals covered a number of issues: Discontinuance of Rte 9 between Wadsworth and
Federal was opposed due to the poor sidewalks leading to light rail stations, with a circulator
route for those neighborhoods proposed as an alternative; objections to the slow speed of the
16th Street Mall Ride; concern about possible travel times on the proposed Rte AF. Non-service
issues raised included a suggestion that an intense safety program be adopted along the line.
One speaker objected to call-n-Ride vans operating in the vicinity of Garrison Station as a

Final West Corridor Service Plan 2013

Written testimony prepared for this meeting and submitted in lieu of making statements included
support for the idea of extending Rte 76Ltd from West Colfax to Olde Town Arvada; a proposal
to replace Rte 17 in the Jeffco Government Center with a fixed route, rather than a call-n-Ride;
adding a deviation to Rte 49 to serve Regis University’s campus.
Bear Creek Elementary School; Bear Valley - Thursday, April 19, 2012
Retaining through service to Civic Center Station on Rtes 100X and 116X was the top concern
among the 32 members of the public who attended the Bear Valley meeting. Similar concerns
were raised on behalf of Rte 2X service in the Green Mountain area. The route alternatives in
the service proposal were opposed, but suggestions were made by customers for other
alternatives. The majority favored – if the Express routes were not retained as they are –
adding a stop on the proposed Regional Rte KC at the unofficial park-n-Ride at C-470/Quincy.
The proposed discontinuance of Rte 21 in the area to be served by the Green Mountain call-nRide was also a concern of many, especially in regard to service for Green Mountain High
School.
Individual concerns were voiced, including the needs of Wheat Ridge High School students on
Rte 32 in the segment proposed to be replaced by a call-n-Ride; concern was also expressed
by a satisfied user of the Dry Creek call-n-Ride who did not feel that call-n-Ride service areas as
large as proposed in the West Corridor plan were workable. Five staff participated in the
meeting.
Hadley Branch – Denver Public Library - Saturday, April 21, 2012
Diverse comments were offered by the eight members of the public who attended the meeting.
One person was critical of the Union Station alignment, versus going into the central Downtown
loop. Another had questions about where the new line would go in Downtown. Others opposed
removing Rte 14 west of Wadsworth, but asked that it be scheduled for favorable connections
with Rte 76; supported restoring Rte 100 service on Sundays; opposed discontinuing Rte 17
service on West 44th Avenue at the Colorado Railroad Museum; expressed concern about
replacing Rte 17 at the Human Services building with the Golden call-n-Ride; supported 7-day a
week operation of the Golden call-n-Ride. Three RTD staff members and one City and County
of Denver planner heard the testimony and answered questions.
Blair-Caldwell Library – Five Points - Saturday, April 21, 2012
The most commonly expressed concern among the 14 members of the public at this meeting
regarded the call-n-Ride service proposed to replace Rte 17 for Jeffco Human Services
buildings and in Applewood replacing segments of Rtes 20, 28, and 32. In brief, the concern
regarding the former is that the special needs of Human Services clients could not be met and
for the latter that capacity would be insufficient. A written proposal was presented describing a
merger of segments of Rtes 20 and 28 to continue serving NREL. Two speakers also objected
to the lack of rail service between Five Points and the West Line/Union Station and favored a
shuttle route of some type.

betrayal of RTD’s commitment not to operate bus service on Garrison Street. RTD Director
Matt Cohen heard the testimony, along with six RTD staff members.

1.B.3.b

Individual statements were made in support of retaining Rte 9 east to Sheridan Boulevard
instead of introducing the new Rte 49; in support of the Rte 16 service change proposal if the
first weekday morning trip remains in the current time frame; in favor of signaling changes on
Welton Street to cure schedule adherence problems; in favor of moving the proposed B-C fare
zone boundary west one station in order to lower fares at Oak Station; opposed removing Rte 3
from Green Mountain; opposed the proposed change in Rte AF; asked for more service for Fort
Logan, especially to and from the D-Line via Rte 51. Among the public attending was former
RTD Director Daryl Kinton. Three RTD staff members heard the testimony and answered
questions.
RTD Blake Street Offices - Wednesday, April 25, 2012
The most urgently expressed interest in the noon meeting in Downtown Denver was in support
of retaining a one-seat ride on Rtes 100X and 116X between western Lakewood and Ken Caryl
points and Civic Center Station. Six of the 26 members of the public attending named this as
their concern. Alternatives were offered by some, including adding a stop at Federal Center
Station or adding an unofficial Park-n-Ride at the C-470/Quincy interchange to the proposed
Rte KC. Individuals raised issues regarding the loss of Rte 2X service to Morrison that can be
used for hiking into concerts at Red Rocks Amphitheater, Rte 21 travel needs of Green
Mountain High School students, a potential shortage of space on Rte 16 if customers do not
switch to Light Rail, replacement of Rte 17 service with call-n-Ride, the double transfer required
to get between the new W-Line and the Southeast F/H-Lines, and a lack of capacity for
wheelchair customers running into other customers on the ramp at Littleton/Downtown Station.
Ten RTD staff members attended the meeting.
Conifer Library, Conifer - Wednesday, April 25, 2012
Support for the proposed West Corridor service plan as related to Rtes CV/CS/CX serving the
Conifer area was the theme of much of the Conifer meeting. One speaker spoke in support of
retaining Rte 6X. Other issues were raised by individuals, including requests for improvements
in specific connections, interest in information about the plans for Pine Junction Park-n-Ride,
and requests to go back to using glass in shelters. Twenty members of the public, plus RTD
Board Director Bruce Daly, were in attendance. Four RTD staff members participated in the
meeting.
Evergreen Library, Evergreen - Saturday, April 28, 2012
The major interest of the 23 attendees was in supporting the proposed retention of through
Regional Rtes EV/ES/EX service into Civic Center Station. Two attendees spoke in support of
retaining Rte AF service at the Federal Center Station. Individual comments included: anxiety
about security for passengers with luggage at Union Station; a request to add a round trip to
Denver from Evergreen on Saturdays and Sundays; a request to run the Evergreen call-n-Ride
till 9:00 p.m.; a request to extend skyRide to Evergreen; noted a need for information on how to
get to the Performing Arts complex from the West Line.

Gene Putnam, Transportation Planning Manager for the City of Thornton, stated that he
supports the comments made by Katie Witt. They are in general support for the RAM
but need further discussion related to: increase in local match above the 2 ½%; What
others have contributed in this process; and trying to get to 104th versus the 72 Street
that RTD has proposed. He stated that sadly RTD is not on time nor on budget.

Memorandum

Bill Mosher provided an update on the Denver Union Station project. They are about
75% completed and have spent $356 million with close to $100 million remaining for
completion.

Packet Pg. 406

1.B.3.b

On the Regional Bus Facility some path of the project goes through bus box
structure. There are a number of improvements that have either been completed or
are under construction. They have completed installation of elevator and escalator at
the Chestnut Pavilion. Skylights are almost completed in the interior. Ticketing
facilities are getting close to completion. Fans are being installed. Curb work is
starting to happen. On East Wewatta (behind DUS) the train bridge caisson and
caps is complete. The pavilion structural steel erections as well as the installation of
elevator and escalator are underway.
On the commuter rail facility, structural work to accommodate 8 tracks is underway.
The train bridge caissons, pier caps and canopy foundation are completed. Steel
fabrication for the CRT canopy is close to completion. UG utility work in the CRT
area is underway. The public notification system addresses public announcements
and emergency notifications. They are also addressing prospective requirements
requested by the Denver Fire Department. The first span of the canopy has been
completed and will be opening it for traffic soon.
Streets & Plaza
Construction is pretty much going as intended. They expect to complete the
Wawatta Street by spring and the Wynkoop Plaza by the end of next year. Streets,
lights, paving and gardens at 17th street has been completed and most of the utilities
are in. The drainage facility to retain water is under construction in front of the
station.
They continue to coordinate with the Denver Union Station Renovation as well as
with the Amtrak move. They expect to have USD completed by the summer of
2014. Public involvement is critical as they have 4 construction projects within feet
of each other. A lot of coordination is taking place, most of which has to do with the
private activities.
Director Bagley thanked Bill Mosher for the presentation. He also mentioned that
during his monthly meeting he received some updates and it is phenomenal what has
been achieved to date. He also suggested that in January the Board needs to have a
tour to see all that has occurred. Bill Mosher agreed that it is a great idea.
Director Tayer is interested to know what the expectation is for the water fountain.
He wondered if the purpose is amusement or just a visual feature. Director Tayer
mentioned the water fountain at DIA being beautiful but it ended up leaking into the
floor so he would like more background. Bill explained that there have been a lot of
discussions; they got rid of two out of the three fountains. This fountain is located
in the sunny part of the facility, it is flat in order to be utilized for concerts and other
events and people will be able to walk through it. They have put in place a
maintenance program to ensure that it is well kept. They have tried to meet all
requirements and tried to make sure it is manageable.

Director McMullen stated that he is concerned, because T-Rex is already showing
some deterioration on the paint. He asked what the longevity is for the paint. He
does not want to see rust coming up in this new project. Bill stated that they have
been assured by the architect that the selected paint will not allow that deterioration.
They are using a very high tech system for the paint alone.
Director Anderson is concerned about the fountain and e-coli virus. They have had
some instances in some fountains in Arvada facing those issues and she asked how
they plan to address this. Bill mentioned that he will have to ask about that, he does
not know. Staff mentioned that they did look at similar parks and they all have a
system that recycles the water and hopefully gets rid of the bacteria but they will
take a closer look at this issue. Director Anderson recommended talking to the
Arvada staff.
Committee Chair Cohen thanked Bill Mosher for coming with the report and
mentioned that regularly this update would be in the planning committee.
II.

CAC Update
David Lewis thanked Scott Reed for making the Citizens Advisory Committee aware
of the Eno Policy Forum being held November 14. He also shared that on December
19 they will have their quarterly meeting here in the Board room. They expect to
have the senior leadership and Board members attending.

Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the ninth year contract
amendment for Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of $22,713,944 for Program

job. She has taken some constituents to visit and it would be a good idea to take
some of the newly elected legislators to visit the project. Bill mentioned that for the
next presentation, he will add private projects and will provide their status. They
need to know the value of the private investment in this project.

Director McMullen seconded the
motion.

Packet Pg. 408

1.B.3.b

Discussion:

Rick Clarke stated that these consultants work as an extension
of the staff; they work together to deliver the programs. Last
year the Board approved a six year option. Right now we are at
the peak of the FasTracks program. It takes a lot of people to
manage that. Each corridor is staffed with a dedicated team to
work with the contractor and the community. Another thing is
that there are not a lot of projects after 2016 so this way RTD
minimizes hiring full time staff and instead uses consultants.
They only spend what they need. Even if a position has been
identified, if the position is not needed the money is not spent.
Director Bagley understands that we are ramping up with the I225 and Eagle P3 projects. He asked what the amount was in
2012 for this contract. Rick stated that it was approximately
$20 million.
Director Malpiede stated that she supports their work and
agrees that it’s a smooth operation and they are DBE compliant.
Rick shared that even though the DBE established for the
program is 7%, their DBE commitment is 22%. They also have
two or three Win participants which is not a contract
requirement.
Director Tobiassen stated that it really represents RTD in terms
of construction and interfacing with Denver Transit Partners. He
asked if Jacobs oversees them on RTD’s behalf. Rick explained
it is a team of RTD and Jacobs’s staff working together. They
advise RTD but the final decision is in the hand of the RTD staff
person. Director Tobiassen also asked how much expertise they
bring and what the number of RTD staff is. Clarke stated that
there are 240 people working full time on FasTracks, this does
not include contractors. They are all integrated into one team.
Staff will provide a count of how many are Jacobs people.
Rick stated that some examples of the type of expertise they
bring are cost estimators. They hire former contractors but it
has been an issue to get an experienced cost estimator. They
also provide P3 expertise, people that have work with P3
internationally. Staff sets up the program and to manage it they
look for Jacobs’s expertise.
Director Anderson stated that it is important to understand that
this contract covers all of the FasTracks projects including West
Rail, US-36, I-225, etc. It is a comprehensive contract.

meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the
motion.
Discussion:

Rick Clarke stated that this is the systems engineering
consultant for electric equipment and black box equipment that
operating people use hands on. Chris Reitter mentioned that
their main sub-consultant is Tri-Unity Engineering. They have
been with RTD since the T-Rex program. Frank Buczkowski
mentioned that they are an extension of the RTD Staff, they
have 4 project managers and they run all the projects. Since
RTD does not have any systems designers, they provide OCS
designers, communications, sub-station designers, construction
project managers and electrical engineers among others. They
also provide civil engineers designs. This provides consistency
and the ability to keep people that are familiar with the system
on board. Some of RTD staff is close to retirement, if they were
to change consultants every year it would be a detriment for the
program.
Director Bagley asked what the figure for 2012 was. Frank
responded that it was about $8 million.

Discussion:

Kevin Diviness stated that this is a 12 year contract signed in
2005 with six initial years and six year options. The full time
staff is only 5 individuals plus some part time staff. The firm
provides the analysis and the tools that his people are utilizing.
RTD has an ISO certified program; this was due to having a
systematic process that established consistency on the project.
The tasks remain the same; establish the quality and audit
programs. This coming year they will not be as involved, but
they have helped with the quality of life program. They have a
5% DBE goal and they have consistently surpassed that.

expressed that this might be an issue to address with the

Approval of 2013 Contract Award to Virtegic Group Incorporated for the
FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach
Consultant
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a one-year
contract award with three one-year options, negotiated annually between RTD
and Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at
the discretion of RTD to Virtegic Group Incorporated, to serve as the
FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach
Consultant, for an amount not to exceed $512,918.40 for the year 2013.
Funds for the award are contained in the 2013 FasTracks Budget.
Motion:

Director Walker made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at
the November 27, 2012 Board
meeting.
Director Malpiede seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Scott Reed stated that as his team briefed the Board when they
did a communications update, they talked about the importance
of having this team as part of the RTD Communications team.
The contract was set up as a one-year contract with four oneyear option, which will be negotiated on an annual basis and
awarded by the Board of Directors. It is important is to have
this team support the activities of the public relations group.
They have to make sure that RTD programs are achieved within
budget; they also need a strong project management team for all
the different activities that need to be performed. The previous
contract had a component to serve as the local government
liaison, which is now under a different contract and Virtegic will
focus on the FasTracks program.

Pauletta Tonilas explained the contract is for 3 fulltime staff
members and 3 part-time and the addition of a web content
coordinator. This is to help with the integration of the
FasTracks and RTD websites. One of the consultants’ time will
have to be embellished in order to establish and maintain a
relationship with the Board of Directors. Sherman Hamilton’s
hours will be increased in this contract for this. They have a
7% SBE goal; however 100% of the contract is SBE performed
as they are SBE certified. They are not asking for staff increase,
the increase is because of the increased hours.
Director Hoy stated that he recalls there were two different
firms bidding for this and that part of the criteria to select the
new firm was cost, but he has the feeling that they are not
getting what they expected. He doesn’t think RTD is getting
the point across to the people. If they were to consider in the
future or maybe this time to go out for bids, part of the criteria
should be on a results oriented process.
Director McMullen stated that he understands that they have
only been with the RTD for a year and they need to probably
have more time to prove themselves. He supports the company
and will support a second year.
Director Walker agreed with Director McMullen. When Virtegic
got onboard RTD has just learned that it would be facing some
problems with funding. Based on his experience with them, it
has been fine. He also believes they are competing with a lot
of the bad information that has been relayed in printed and
broadcast media. He will support the contract.
Director Malpiede asked for clarification on the breakdown of
staff. Pauletta explained that it is for 3 full-time, 3 part-time
and one additional person that will be added as the web content
coordinator. Currently there are 7 staff members but they are
not exercising the option for graphic design.
Director Anderson agrees with Director Hoy. It has been a
difficult year and she feels uneasy on what the contract is trying
to accomplish. She would have expected this consultant to
stop some of the things that have happened. There was a
Mayor of a Northern city that did not have the right information
and he should have. She is not inclined to vote for this.

Director Daly also supports Director’s Hoy position; he agrees
that in the past they have been rather invisible. Director Daly
mentioned that staff stated that they have shifted some of the

Packet Pg. 413

1.B.3.b

responsibility from Virtegic to CRL. Pauletta explained that this
contract is not for local government relations. The consultant
team needs to have more interaction with the Board and the
scope does include establishing and maintaining the relationship.
Director Daly expressed that he did not feel the town hall
meetings went as well as they should have.
Director Deadwyler expressed that she has mixed feelings. This
is a brand new company and probably should have the
opportunity to move forward. However, , she has been
disappointed on what has been generated and how now they
are trying to accomplish so much and it is hard to make sense of
what their role is. They have not been seen in the things they
are supposed to be participating in. They should keep the Board
informed of things that they should know about and be prepared
to address. She believes the contract needs more definition, the
Board needs to know what the outcomes are. Scott agreed that
it’s important to define what their role is versus CRL role, even
thought there might be some overlap. Director Deadwyler
stated that there needs to be clear expectations and
understanding of what their role is and have reporting focused
on outcomes too.
Director Tobiassen agrees with Directors Hoy and Anderson; he
just doesn’t see a lot of activity. He gets a lot of
communication internally from RTD staff but we are not getting
the message out. Getting the information out doesn’t need to
cost a lot of money. He is faced on a daily basis with people
that have the wrong information.
Director Tayer will support this, because he thinks the staff does
a good job in communicating what RTD does and Virtegic’s role
seems to be to support staff on achieving this. Communication
is key. He is concerned about the notion of additional funding
for liaison activities with the Board and would like to see more
detail on what the additional cost is. Pauletta explained that
Sherman was supposed to work only 30% and his time is
increasing to 40%. Another person is going from 50% to 75%
to assist on the I-225 public information efforts. Director Tayer
stated that he still needs more information to understand what
the goals are. He will support it but it needs more information
to better understand the value of this group.

Committee Chair Cohen asked David Lewis to speak on behalf
of the CAC. David stated that he would not want to presume to
speak for the entire committee. He echoed that this is the first
year working with this group and he believes there is a learning

General Manager Washington reiterated that the scope of work
for the company had changed. He reminded the Board that the
first years of the contracts that were approved unanimously did
not go smooth. This group has been working for less than 12
months; they walked in right as the Board decided not to go to a
vote with a lot of changes and lot of criticism to the FasTracks
plan. General Manager Washington stated that they will provide
the new scope and how they will be measured. Virtegic has
fulfilled the scope that they were given, they have done what
was asked from them. He asked the Board to look favorably to
this contract.
Director McMullen mentioned that he appreciated the telephone
town halls; he thinks that it was better bang for the buck than
all the newsletters put out in preceding years. FasTracks has a
lot of requirements that are complex, like CAC, he likes the
FasTracks website. He thinks this team is doing a good job.
Director Malpiede stated that she also shares the same concerns
as Director Deadwyler. She participated in the town hall and it
was not good. She did the town hall both years, and it was
completely different. She agrees that things might have been a
little tough; however they are expected to come in with an
expertise in communications, and she has seen lack of
information or misinformation in the community. She will
support for one more year, but she really wants to have some
clear expectations.
Pauletta stated that for the town halls they used different
vendors and this should not be attributed to the Virtegic team.
They have gone through a complex process to revise the
strategic plan for FasTracks and the Virtegic team has been a
great support. She is responsible for all the staff and the
consultants; she will work with them.
Director Anderson stated that probably the easiest way to go is
to have the deliverables more clearly defined so that the Board
knows exactly what to expect. She will vote no, but would like
to have more definite deliverable for the Board meeting.

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

curve. He wants to be supportive of them as they work their
way through this process. He reiterated that this is just his
individual opinion.

Director Walker mentioned that he has over 20 years of
transportation experience and he has not seen a transportation
project with an accurate description. The consultant is only an

Director Hoy asked General Manager Washington and the staff
that for next time this issue comes in front of the Board he
would like to see a report of what they were supposed to do
and what the outcome was. It is not clear if the contract has a
new scope or will continue with the old scope. Pauletta
explained that the document shows the scope that they were
given and that it will be the same for the new contract. Director
Hoy also mentioned that the town hall meeting was also a bad
experience for him.
Director James mentioned that he has been talking to Scott
Reed about working with some elected officials in his district.
He asked if that was part of the scope. Scott stated that it
could be either. Virtegic creates information to be disseminated,
but one-on-one meetings would be coordinated by CRL. Virtegic
focuses on written communication between RTD and the
community and this might include elected officials briefings.
They are trying to develop one at the programmatic level. This
is not lobbying, but informational. The contract clearly states
“assist”. They will assist RTD staff; they are not to lead these
things. E-newsletter, new developments, that happens through
the staff and consultants team.
Director James has been asking for several months for some
information and has not seen anything. Scott stated that he
sent the information on Saturday. Director James agrees with
Director Hoy and others in that it will be nice if the extension of
the contract includes metrics.
Director Bagley stated to the staff that in summary, this has
been a challenging year for everybody, and communications are
essential and key to what we do. Communication is a big piece
of what we do to inform stakeholders, either elected officials or
community members.
Director Malpiede stated that it is clear to her that she doesn’t
understand the communication department. For the Board
meeting she wants a matrix of what RTD staff do versus
Virtegic and who does what.

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

extension of the staff. He has been in several positions and
probably has a better understanding of their position so he will
support.

Committee Chair Cohen stated that he shares some of the
concerns and he has had conversations with Pauletta and sat
with Rick Clarke to discuss this. Communications is an essential

Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
It is recommended by the FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Major Service Change Policy, Disparate Impact Policy and
Disproportionate Burden Policy to comply with federal laws, regulations and
guidelines with respect to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Motion:

Director Malpiede made the motion
to move this item to the full Board
at the November 27, 2012 Board
meeting.
Director McMullen seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Presentation was part of the package. Kenn Hardin stated that
this particular action is related to the need to complete the
analysis prior to the West Rail opening; this is a new Title VI
action that occurred at the FTA. Michael Washington explained
that the important thing is that it governs the way that RTD
projects should be evaluated for equity in service and fare
changes.
Director Tayer asked if the term “considered” is a technical/legal
term. Staff explained that Title VI allows RTD to make an
argument that there might be a legitimate business consideration
for a despair impact.

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

part of what we do. He also has an issue with the prior
statement about Sherman’s hours being embellished to have
liaison with the Board. He asked all members to vote for the
contract; he understands this is a small business.

Director McMullen asked if this is a housekeeping update for
Title VI. Staff explained that this is actually a result of other

Packet Pg. 417

1.B.3.b
Minutes of the FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting held on November 13th, 2012
Page 13 of 18

Director Tobiassen asked how the ADA Act of 1964 fits into
this. Staff explained that in Title VI there is a specific circular
that lays out these requirements. As far as ADA it takes
different requirements as it relates to service changes.
Director Deadwyler asked where this may occur and if Five
Points would fall in this category. Staff explained that it
depends on whether the change is qualified as a major change.
Is this 25% of service, if so, they might have to reconsider the
change. They will publish the analysis once it is complete.
Director Walker stated that this will make for a challenging
analysis, since there has been a shift on the concentration of
low income populations. It will be interesting to see the results.
Staff stated that this is a growing trend nationwide, it is a
complex situation. This is new ground for Civil Rights.

Updates
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between RTD and Public Agency Stakeholders
Regarding the Northwest Area Mobility Study
Bill Van Meter introduced Brian Welch. This MOU is for the Northwest. They wanted
to have an agreement in place that will memorialize the commitment and make sure
they stay on time and on budget. The MOU defines deadlines and they have
circulated a draft of this to stakeholders and have received feedback which is
included in the document presented. Staff wanted to ensure the Board was informed
of the MOU’s contents before sending this to the stakeholders in each of the entities
listed.

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

issues around the country and efforts by the FTA to ensure
equity.

Director Tayer thanked the staff for all their hard work and for the way they
outreached to the stakeholders which has been phenomenal. He will support the
MOU and continue to track in order to make sure that it is open to the public and
make sure there is sufficient public outreach. He wants to allow the opportunity to

Director Walker asked what would happen if consensus cannot be reached as
expressed on page 2. Brian explained that they envision having a voting system in
order to get a vote. They have received feedback from stakeholders and they have
agreed to work with us.
Director Anderson requested to include the city of Arvada as a stakeholder in this.
The North Part of Arvada is right next to the US-36 corridor.
Director Hoy asked if the stakeholders have been involved in this MOU. Brian
explained that the red lines and strikeouts are the feedback and comments received
from the stakeholders who had until yesterday to provide it. Director Hoy stated that
the stakeholders’ feedback should have been asked prior to the Board package being
finalized.
Director Malpiede thanked the staff for reaching out to the stakeholders and
requested that when the document is finalized to have a press conference with all
these Mayors to make sure the message is passed that this will be a joined effort, we
will do it together.
FasTracks Moving Filling the Internal Savings Account (Back-Up provided at the
meeting)
General Manager Washington introduced John Elias, agency historian. He also
explained that no action required of the board at this meeting. He reminded the
Board that they presented the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) initiative in a prior
meeting. Its purpose is to create a savings account in order to move the FasTracks
projects forward. They have identified $300 million in some project that they are
looking to complete.
He clarified that even though in page 4 of the presentation the project initiation is
established for 2017 they would move faster if the account has the required funds.
They have identified 8 priority projects which represent the highest value
recommended opportunities. Staff proposes to approach the Board for approval in
the December cycle.
1. Evaluate FasTracks funding for Base System Operations. Beginning in 2014,
FasTracks funding to support base system operations will increase at the rate of
inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

screen all options at the front end so that we are not fighting those battles at the
end.

The RAM proposal would be starting with the 2014 contribution growing at a
slower pace. They are not talking about impacting services on the street or the
new corridor. Risk level for this item is medium, because if there was a
significant downturn in the economy, RTD would have to access management

Packet Pg. 419

1.B.3.b
Minutes of the FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting held on November 13th, 2012
Page 15 of 18

2. Reduce FasTracks minimum unrestricted fund balance from $150 million. RTD
currently assumes a minimum balance of $150 million, starting in 2013 to
address the potential downturn in sales and use tax receipts; potential delays in
receiving Eagle Project federal grant funding and potential unforeseen
circumstances that could increase project costs. It also reserves a debt service
reserve for the 2012A bonds to be issued this year.
Staff believes that they can put $72 million in the internal savings account from
2014 to 2017. This means reducing the amount of this balance gradually. This
has a risk level of medium because RTD must maintain fund balance until risks are
mitigated; in case of economic downturn there would be less funding than
anticipated for on-going capital projects or reductions in service levels for
FasTracks projects commensurate with the severity of the downturn. They
believe it is prudent to maintain a debt service reserve equal to the maximum
annual debt service on 2012A bonds.
3. Reduce FasTracks O&M fund balance from three to two months. Staff believes
that by reducing the reserve for the O&M fund would add $10 million into the
saving accounts. This has a medium risk understanding that if there is a
significant economic downturn it could result in less funding than anticipated for
on-going capital projects or reduction in O&M levels for FasTracks projects.
4. Defer UPRR relocation for the SW corridor extension. UPRR relocation would be
completed once funding is identified for the entire project. Risk level is low as it
may raise concerns from stakeholder and completing the relocation without
finishing the entire extension does not provide any mobility benefit for RTD
customers.
5. Achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under contract. These
can be identified once projects are in construction and significant risk milestones
have reached. Risk level is low considering that an economic downturn or rapid
escalation of construction costs could result in less funding than anticipated for
on-going capital projects. FasTracks maintains contingency levels for individual
projects but does not currently have any contingency at the program-wide level.
6. Sales/Lease Opportunities for all RTD properties. Staff will provide a list of all
properties surplus. Will have to be careful with some properties that have federal
interest. Risk Level Low. Some properties have federal interest which could
impact the terms or limit RTD’s ability to sell or lease. RTD may receive pressure
to dispose of property at less than fair market value. May also evaluate the use
of existing properties for easements (cell tower, sharing conduit, etc)

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

reserves or reduce base systems service levels commensurate with the severity of
the economic downturn. The strategic budget plan does not include any service
reduction. Staff believes by implementing this proposal they could put $24
million to additional FasTracks capital programs.

Packet Pg. 420

1.B.3.b
Minutes of the FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting held on November 13th, 2012
Page 16 of 18

8. Sales Tax Audit/Parity, this will require legislative action. Work with legislators to
allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts, this would provide RTD with better
management/control over collection. Will provide RTD parity with the State on
Sales tax exemptions. It could potentially increase RTD’s capacity to bond. The
risk level is low as some vendor may oppose. There are not current objections
from the Department of Revenue. Could work with other special districts to
enact a statewide audit, not just RTD. This could generate about 127 million.
This also has a positive effect in the base system, because the additional revenue
could generate higher level of service.
The approval of these recommendations could get us to $277 million by 2017. We
are almost at 70% of lines in construction or schedules for construction in FasTracks,
this would put us at 90% without a sales tax increase. This will provide a way
forward for North Metro to 72nd. They receive some questions about the “at least to
72nd“. They are trying to do more, but it’s a fine line for the grant. If we get to 88th
on our own, the application for the grant will have less opportunity. We need to
have the high ridership included for the grant.
Once the account is created they will report to the Board on a consistent basis.
Additional risk allocation matrix opportunities for future Board consideration (page
27) RTD has a very rich span of services, compare to other areas where they stop
services at midnight.
Next steps: they will make themselves available to address any questions that the
Board members might have. They will present the report for approval in the
December cycle. 2013 would kick off the process.
Director Hoy asked if on item 1 the $24 million is the total or annual amount. Phil
responded that it is cumulative. Director Hoy also asked for clarification if on item 2
funds would go in the account immediately. Phil stated that it will be stacked as
projects get completed. Director Hoy also stated that on item 7 it will be interesting
to see how stakeholders react. He also stated that it would be great for RTD to do
self collection. Phil explained that this issue does not include a self collection option.
Director Hoy also asked if the audit issue is part of the bills the consultant mentioned
earlier. Phil answered that he hopes so. Director Hoy mentioned that he wants to
understand the grant process. Phil explained that we become more competitive with
the cost effective index, the formula that goes with the grant. We become more
competitive by leaving the areas of high ridership. Some comments are that we can
only apply for the grant until service is up to 72nd, but they think they can overcome.

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update)

7. Request increase in local participation above current 2.5%. This has a risk level
of Low as in current environment many jurisdiction may find providing additional
funding challenging and contributions that do not have “hard value” will not
accelerate project schedules.

Packet Pg. 421

1.B.3.b

Director Tayer mentioned that it would be very helpful if we could come up with
some alignment to make sure that we are all in the same page with regard to the
ridership issue. We need to get the feedback from the stakeholders and make sure
they understand that we are in alignment with the completion of the North corridor.
In terms of the risk level assigned to the items, some of them are tight to a downturn
of the economy; he would want to know what would be the actual impact if the
downturn does happen. Phil explained that what we know that is what has happen
to date, but with assumptions presented in the strategic plan it has no service
reduction or fare increase. Director Tayer asked what would be the impact of a
downturn, what the fluctuation in the sales tax would be. Bill Van Meter responded
that there are several actions that can be taken when addressing a downturn.
Director Tayer stated that we should have an idea of what is the level that would
force us to take action.
Director Tayer asked if even though the implementation is set for 2017, if could we
start using the money before 2017. Phil responded that it would be at the Board’s
discretion. What we don’t want is to go into the account for small projects, but for
a big project.
Director Tayer also expressed that with regard to the sales tax audit/parity issue, we
have been exempted for some of the sales tax on soda, etc.
Director Daly asked is the parking fee issue is part of the FasTracks Moving Forward
Plan. Phil responded that it is not, that would be mostly funds for the base systems,
but is something that we could look at.
Director McMullen stated that this is a very good roadmap for the next couple of
years. It gives a nice way to go without having to raise tax. This is a very flexible
FasTracks achievement road map.
Director Bagley stated that during the one-on-one meetings between directors and
staff they can go into discussion and allow them to get the particulars that interest
each director.
Director Tobiassen asked if the assumption for the tax audit/parity, which represents
a big number is based on a study.
Director Anderson thanked Phil for the document. She had some concern when it
was first brought up but thinks this is a good plan. Going back to ridership, the West
Corridor was built first because in terms of ridership it came out on top. The issue
for ridership is very important for the North corridor and it is important to understand
the ridership past 72nd. That story needs to be understood in those northern
communities.

•Based on the excellent response rate, the statistical confidence, and congruence with previous results, the
results of this survey are considered representative and valid.
•Sampling plans for all services were based on boardings, time of day of boardings and either proportion of
boardings by station, or proportion of boardings by division, route, run and block to help ensure
representativeness of the sample.
•Bus, Call-n-Ride and SkyRide surveys were distributed by operators over the course of their shifts. Light rail
surveys were distributed at light rail stations by employees of BBC Research and Consulting.
•In order to encourage participation in the survey, each survey was accompanied by 2 Free Ride Coupons.
•A total of 6221 completed surveys were received. This represents a response rate of 37% overall and a
response rate varying between 30.3%-40.9% depending on the service type.
•The table below summarizes the statistical accuracy of the survey results for each service type margin of
error, at a 95% confidence level, for binary, evenly distributed responses.

Key Findings
All RTD services received outstanding positive Overall Satisfaction ratings.

Attachment: 2013-2015 Title VI Program Update Appendices (1541 : 2013-2015 Title VI

1.B.3.b

Whether measured by the average Overall Satisfaction ratings, or by the percentage of customers selecting either a ‘4’
or ‘5’ on a scale where ‘1 = Poor’ and ‘5 = Excellent,’ RTD customers clearly communicate a very high level of
satisfaction with the services they use.
The very high Overall Customer Satisfaction with RTD services has changed little since the last iteration of surveys in
2008.

As indicated by the high average overall satisfaction ratings of all services, RTD performs well on the factors which
are most important to customers.

Central to this report are several Quadrant Analyses, which classify rated items on the surveys in term of Importance
and Performance for each service type. In addition, the items that have been determined to be key drivers of
satisfaction through statistical analysis are a primary focus of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction Survey reports,

• In order to simplify the presentation of bus customer
satisfaction, the numerous items have been categorized
based on the importance of the factor relative to Overall
Satisfaction and the performance on that item as indicated by
customers‟ average ratings.
• Importance is determined by the strength of relationship with
Overall Satisfaction.

– Note - Key Drivers: Special emphasis is placed on some items
that have been shown to have a predictive and causal
relationship with Overall Satisfaction. The difference between a
‘good’ Overall Satisfaction rating and a ‘bad’ Overall Satisfaction
rating is due to the differences in ratings of Key Drivers.

• Performance is displayed by using average ratings. All
aspects of satisfaction were measured on a 5-point scale
where 1 = Very Poor and 5 = Excellent.

Light Rail Customer Satisfaction: Caution
•
•

Items identified in this section have low average ratings as compared to other items, however these items also
have a somewhat weaker relationship with Overall Satisfaction.
Frequency of fare inspections is a Key Driver of Overall Satisfaction. Customer comments indicate that more
frequent fare inspections are desired to address the perception that a substantial portion of light rail riders are
evading fares. As Safety and Security reports indicate a low rate of fare evasion, it may be more advantageous to
address the perception of fare evasion rates than to put additional resources towards fare inspections.

Light rail passengers that pay for parking have a statistically lower rating of light rail
service overall and “Value received for the fare you paid for this trip” when compared
with those that are not required to pay for parking. No other services had statistically
significant differences in ratings on these items between those that do and do not pay
for parking.

•

The percentage of passengers that are paying for parking but do not know whether
their residence is “In-District” or “Out-of-District” is shown below. As fees, as well as
whether one is required to pay or not, as well as the daily rate that must be paid, is
determined by In-District or Out-of-District classification, the seemingly large
proportion paying without knowing their status may indicate a potential problem with
communicating parking payment requirements.

Methodology
•Based on the excellent response rate, the statistical confidence, and congruence with previous
results, the results of this survey are considered representative and valid.
•A sampling plan, was constructed to provide a representative sampling plan by route. Operators were
assigned labeled surveys with Division, Box, Route, Run and Block to help ensure a representative
sample.
•Operators were instructed to distribute the surveys throughout their shifts in order to most closely
approximate a random sample without preventing operators from efficiently completing their route.
•39.3% of the surveys distributed were returned. This response rate is excellent. And comparable with
response rates from prior years..
•3859 completed surveys resulted in a 1.5% margin of error, at a 95% confidence level, for
binary, evenly distributed responses. This level of accuracy is congruent with previous bus customer
satisfaction surveys conducted by RTD.
•Below are the Margin of Error calculations for each Service Level at a 95% confidence interval.

•In comparing Transit Dependent riders to Choice Riders (definitions provided on
slides 11 and 12) we find that Choice riders are statistically more satisfied than
Transit Dependent riders. This difference in satisfaction is likely due to dissatisfied
Choice riders choosing another method of transportation..
•RTD bus operator performance is one particular highlight of this report. Bus
operator performance ratings can be found in the table below and in several other
sections of the report.

#1 ENFORCE(MAKE SURE PLS!) YOUR DRIVERS REMEMBER TO PUNCH REGIONAL TRANSFERS! BOULDER TO
THORNTONS 88TH & WASHINGTON TAKES ME ALMOST 2 HOURS! (BX-120X) IN ORDER TO BE @ WORK @
8:30AM...TO GO 20 MILES?! TOO LONG, TOO MUCH$. DRIVERS ARE EITHER 10'S IN NICE/PROFESSIONAL OR
HORRIBLY ANGRY AND TESTY WHEN ASKED QUESTIONS, DIRECTIONS OR GIVING INFO. MONTHLY PASS
SHOULD HAVE A PAYMENT PLAN W?DISCOUNT FOR US EVERYDAY WORKERS - WHO ARE NOT DISABLED OR
STUDENTS ($176!?!) BOULDER TO THORNTON TRIPS COSTS ME ONLY $4.00 LESS THAN DRIVING A
CAR...ALMOST NOT WORTH IT! LOCAL - REGIONAL NEEDS COST STREAMLINING. WEB SITES ROUTE MAPPING
FEATURE ALMOST NEVER WORKS! WORTHLESS FUNCTIONALLY. REGIONAL WIFI INCLUDED PLEASE!
PLEASE!!! *BX & 120X DRIVERS NEVER REMEMBER TO PUNCH REGIONAL TRANSFERS SO AS A NEW RIDE
COMMUTING BEEN SCOLDED "ANGRY" BY LATER DRIVERS BLAMING ME?!
#3 LEAVING GREEN MOUNTAIN LEAVES EARLY SO BE AT THE BUS STOP EARLY. THANK YOU
#35 IS NEVER ON TIME, I'VE HAD TO START MAKING DIFFERENT ROUTES TO GET TO WORK WHICH TAKES ME
LONGER, BUT I'M NOT LATE FOR WORK. IT WOULD BE NICE IF HE #35 WAS LOOKED AT FOR BETTER
SERVICE. ALSO MAYBE A BUS UP & DOWN COUNTY LINE RD BETWEEN BROADWAY & I-25, AND A 1/2 MONTH
PASS OR ONE THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE FROM DATE TO DATE.
#9 BUS NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED ESP. ON WEEKENDS.
0L - PLEASE MAKE STOP AT LINCOLN-9TH AVE TO NORTH BOUND. THANK YOU!
1 OR 2 MORE BUSES DEN/BLDR ROUTE BETWEEN 9-10AM AND 6:30-7:30PM
1 SKIP BUS SERVICE: A-THERE IS ONE DRIVER (NOT THE DRIVER FOR TODAY'S TRIP) WHO INSISTED THAT ALL
PASSENGERS EXIT THROUGH THE REAR DOORS AND GOT QUITE ANNOYED WHENEVER ANYONE EXITED
THROUGH THE FRONT DOORS. THE OTHER DRIVERS DON'T INSIST, AND ARE GENERALLY IN A MUCH BETTER
MOOD. SUGGESTION: LET PEOPLE GET OFF THROUGH EITHER SET OF DOORS. B-THE BUS IS OVERHEATED
SO MUCH THAT PASSENGERS HAVE A HUGE TEMPERATURE SHIFT-FROM VERY COLD OUTDOORS TO HOT IN
THE BUS, AND THEN OUT TO THE VERY COLD. SUGGESTION: ASK THE DRIVERS TO BUNDLE UP A BIT MORE
AND SET THE BUS TEMPERATURE SO THAT PASSENGERS DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE OFF THEIR HATS, COATS
AND GLOVES TO KEEP FROM ROASTING. C-THE BOULDER SCENERY IS GORGEOUS, BUT THE BUS WINDOWS
ARE FREQUENTLY SO DIRTY THAT IT'S HARD TO SEE THE OUTDOORS. SUGGESTION: WASH THE WINDOWS A
LITTLE MORE OFTEN. 2-THE SKYRIDE IS GREAT. DON'T CHANGE IT!
1- YOU ONCE HAD AN ANNOUNCEMENT NOTICE OF "NEXT BUS ARRIVAL" AT THE TABLE MESA P AND R. I'D
LIKE TO SEE IT REINSTATED & EXPANDED (SAME SYSTEM AT THE TRANSIT CENTER). 2-VERY OCCASIONALLY
AT THE TABLE MESA P AND R, AN EXPRESS BUS WILL PULL UP. EVERYBODY GETS ON, BUS WILL PULL UP,
EVERYBODY GETS ON & ANOTHER EXPRESS FROM BEHIND WILL LEAVE BEFORE THE DU ???. I UNDERSTAND
THE "DM BEHIND" WAS LATER & THE ?? ??? WAS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE LATER. IT'D HELP IF THE DRIVER
COULD DIRECT YOU TO THE BUS THAT WILL LEAVE FIRST.
1) DO YOUR BEST NOT TO CUT :)2)LIGHT RAIL CONNECTING DEN/BLDR/FC!!! EXCELLENT LOST & FOUND
SERVICE, PROMOTIONS TO WHOEVER HANDLES SUCH IN THE BLDR STATION!
1)A COMPANION FARE. 2)LONGER TRANSFER TIMES! 3)MORE ROUTE FREQUENCY ON EVENINGS AND
WEEKENDS.
1)BUS SERVICE ON WEEKENDS, ESPECIALLY SUNDAY FOR PEOPLE WHO GO TO CHURCH. 2)TOKENS OR
CHANGE MACHINES @PARK-N-RIDE FOR THOSE W/O BILLS SMALLER THAN $5 OR UNABLE TO GET CASH.
3)MORE SHELTER LIKE STOPS AT DOWNTOWN BY STATION FOR COLD/SNOW/HOT WEATHER.
1)CONSIDER "BEFORE" AND "AFTER" HOURS OPERATIONS WITH "CALL-N-RIDE" SERVICE. SOME RIDERS
DEPEND ON YOU FOR TRANSPORT TO AND FROM WORK. 2)RE-ADJUST LONGMONT SCHEDULE SO THAT
LOCAL BUSES ARRIVE AND DEPART AT SAME TIME. "TWEAK" AS NECESSARY SO THAT THESE ARRIVALS AND
DEPARTURES ARE ABOUT HALFWAY BETWEEN ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES OF J, L, BOLT AND FLEX. 3)SEE
ATTACHED FOR ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS. 4)HAVING 323 AND 324 "DEADHEAD" CREATES CONFUSION WITH
RIDERS:IN ADDITION, THERE ARE NO SCHEDULED BUS STOPS ALONG THIS SECTION OF HIGHWAY 66, USED
FOR THE "DEADHEADING". TO CONTINUE EAST FROM 17TH AND LASHLEY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE
PLACES FOR SEVERAL ADDITIONAL STOPS. 5)GIVING THE "SKYLINE" PORTION OF THE 323 TO HE NORTHSIDE
LOOPS FREES THE 323 FOR TRIPS TO THE SOUTHSIDE WALMART. TRUE THIS IS IN WELD COUNTY AND
DOESN'T OPERATE THERE, BUT THERE IS A SMALL RESIDENTIAL AREA SOUTH OF 119 AND 3RD AVENUE
WHICH IS IN BOULDER COUNTY. A STOP COULD BE PLACED IN THIS AREA, ALTHOUGH RIDERS WHO WANTED
TO SHOP IN THIS WALMART WOULD HAVE TO WALK A SHORT DISTANCE TO GET THERE. THERE HAS BEEN
TALK THAT THE REGIONAL PART OF THE RTD RUN ON HOVER IS TO BE ELIMINATED. IF THIS IS NOT
1)CROWDED BUS PASSENGERS NEED TO MOVE TO REAR OF BUS TO MAKE ROOM FOR BOARDING
PASSENGERS. 2)FOR LATE RIDERS AFTER UNSET, PROVIDE FLASHING BLUE HAND LIGHT TO USE AT BUS
STOP BEFORE BOARDING BUS. 3)MOST BUS STOPS ARE ABOUT 2-3 BLOCKS, WHAT IS THE LEAST?
PROPOSED, 1 1/2 BLOCKS BETWEEN BUS STOPS, AND SHELTERS HAVE HARD PLASTIC TO PROTECT FROM
STRONG WINDS. 4)HIRE MORE BUS DRIVERS AND INCREASE FREQUENCY ON COLORADO BLVD, COLFAX,
NORTH HAVANA & SOUTH WEST
1)DE-ICE SHELTERS & SIDEWALKS. 2)SOME SORT OF SERVICE DOOR TO PNR OR STATION IN BOULDER.
3)QUARTERLY OR 6 MONTH PASSES.
1)GET THE HIGH SCHOOL ONTO OTHER BUSES - THEY RUIN YOUR SCHEDULES, TIMELINESS AND THE
ATMOSPHERE ON THE BUSES! 2)LET THE BOULDER BUSES GO TIL 11PM LIKE THEY USED TO. 3)BUS
AVAILABILITY FOR ME (204N) WAS TWICE AS GOOD 10 YEARS AGO (204N AND 202N).
1)HAVE TRAINED DRIVERS WHO KNOW ROUTE IN ADVANCE, DON'T RELY ON PASSENGERS. 2)OPEN DOORS &
LET US ON WHEN BAD WEATHER IS PRESENT (MORNING DRIVERS SITS & WON'T PULL UP UNTIL LAST MINUTE
SO WE ARE COLD OR WET---?!

Light rail Overall Satisfaction ratings remain high, achieving an
average rating of 4.11.
The average Overall satisfaction rating has declined slightly since the
last iteration of the survey, falling to 4.11 in 2011 from 4.3 in 2008.
Ratings for key drivers of overall satisfaction are strong to moderate
for both Transit Dependent and Choice Riders [Slides 22-23].
Approximately half of all light rail riders utilize Park-n-Rides.
Satisfaction for aspects of Park-n-Ride facilities are moderate. Those
that use a Park-n-Ride had a lower average Overall satisfaction rating
with light rail service than those that do not use Park-n-Ride facilities,
suggesting some opportunity for improvement in this area. [Slides 4043].
Approximately 7% of light rail passengers pay for parking at light rail
stations. Parking payment overall, and all aspects of the parking
payment program were rated very low by passengers that have paid
for parking. Those that pay for parking have statistically lower ratings
of „Overall Satisfaction‟ and „Value received for the fare you paid for
this trip.‟ [Slides 44-45].

Methodology
•

Based on the excellent response rate, the statistical confidence, and congruence with
previous results, the results of this survey are considered representative and valid.

•

A sampling plan, was constructed to provide a representative sample based on boardings
per station at specific times of day.

•

In order to distribute surveys by station at specific time frames, agents from BBC
Research and Consulting were employed. Survey administrators were provided with
distribution quotas for light rail stations
Operators were instructed to distribute the surveys throughout their shifts in order to most
closely approximate a random sample without preventing operators from efficiently
completing their route.

•

•

Customers had the option of either returning completed surveys by mail or completing the
survey online using a link and a validation code printed on the survey.

•

1210 completed surveys resulted in a 2.74% margin of error, at a 95% confidence level,
for binary, evenly distributed responses. This level of accuracy superior previous light rail
customer satisfaction surveys conducted by RTD.

•

30.3% of the surveys distributed were returned. This response rate is excellent, however
it is marginally lower than from prior years, however the sampling plan was designed to
improve accuracy, and therefore called for more surveys to be distributed. Therefore, while
the response rate was lower, more responses were received.

advised.
•Frequency of fare inspections are a key driver of satisfaction for Transit Dependent
riders. Transit Dependent riders rate this factor moderately.
•Choice Riders rate the frequency of fare inspections low. Based on customer comments
received from this survey effort, along with information from other sources it is likely
that more fare checks are desired despite the seemingly low citation rate for fare
inspections on light rail vehicles provided in RTD Security reports.

•Overall satisfaction with Park-n-Rides are statistically related to all of the rated attributes
of Park-n-Rides.
•In the table below, the higher the numeric value, the greater the influence that factor has
on overall satisfaction.
•Moderate ratings of all aspects of Park-n-Ride overall indicate some opportunity for
improvement. Those that use a Park-n-Ride had a lower average Overall satisfaction rating
with light rail service than those that do not use Park-n-Ride facilities. The average ‘Overall
light rail satisfaction’ rating for those that use Park-n-Ride facilities is 4.0, compared to 4.24
for those that do not use Park-n-Rides. While this effect is present, it must be considered
that Transit Dependent riders, who are less likely to use Park-n-Ride facilities have a higher
Overall Satisfaction rating when compared to Choice Riders, so it is possible that the Parkn-Ride use is not the cause of the difference in Overall Satisfaction between these groups.

Do you have any other suggestions for improving RTD's light rail service?
1) Better notifications of delays on marquee signs at station.
12 BUS SCHEDULE SUCKS, MAKE IT GO THROUGH DOWNTOWN AGAIN. THEN NORTH, TRANSFERS NOW
SUCK TO CONNECT. 15 BILLION WASTED ON SMART CARD SYSTEM, DOES NOT WORK, BETTER TO USE
MONEY. THINK WHEN SPENDING MONEY, WE DON’T I SUPPORT YOU, SPEND MONEY WISE YOU DON'T. (?)
Add an indicator in the front and rear of the train so when parked at an end station, riders coming to the platform can
see when the train will leave starting it's journey. I have seen people run for no reason and take time and miss the
train.
Add more cars for the D line from Stout to Mineral at 5-5:30pm ride home. Always crowded and have to stand up.
ALL IS GOOD, SERVICES ARE WELL. BUS DRIVERS ALWAYS ON TIME AND TAKE YOU WEHRE YOU NEED TO BE
ON TIME.
ALLOW PASSENGERS TO BOARD MORE QUICKLY AT NINE MILE WHEN IT IS COLD. I SEE THE TRAIN BUT IT
DOES NOT PULL FORWARD COME ON NOW, I'M FREEZING HERE!
Although an increase in the parking areas is necessary, a quick-easier solution could be organize the current areas.
On daily basis I see waste of space because there are no limits on the parking spots. Increase frequency of D line
(Mineral-18th & Downing and 30th & Downing) from 7am to 8am. Thank you
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON TRAINS ARE FREQUENTLY OUT OF SYNC WITH STOPS. I'VE SEEN SEVERAL VISUALLY
IMPAIRED PEOPLE STRUGGLE, CLOSURES OF STATION HAVE NOT BEEN CONSISTENTLY ANNOUNCE, NOT
EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THE WEBSITE. OVERALL, IT'S A GOOD SYSTEM BUT TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT
IS COVERED.
BE ON TIME MORE AND MORE COURTEOUS DRIVERS.
BETTER SHELTER FROM BAD WEATHER AT THE DRY CREEK STATION WOULD BE NICE.
BETTER TIMING BETWEEN LIGHT RAIL STOPS/BUS CONNECTIONS IE TRAIN ARRIVING AND BUS LEAVES AS
TRAIN PULLS UP.
C,D AROUND 6:30 HAVE BEEN RUNNING STRANGELY LATE
CNR, NEED MORE FREQUENT SERVICE TO GET ME TO WORK BEFORE 8AM AS THE BUSES USUALLY FULL
AND IT TAKES 30 MIN TO TRAVE LR TO OFFICE.
COVERED STATIONS FOR BOTH BUS AND LIGHT RAIL WHILE WAITING FOR BUR OR LR. HELPS REALLY
DURING WINTER. DIFFICULT TO TRAVEL LR IN WINTER.
CREDIT CARD MACHINES TO PURCHASE TICKETS.
CREDIT CARD PAYMENT AT TICKET WINDOWS.
Do not close the doors so quickly! I know that your drivers have mirrors so give the riders a chance to get on with out
pushing other riders or prying the doors open! Please allow plenty of time for ALL passengers to get on board! Don't
close the doors and then sit there for five minutes when other passengers are pushing the button to board!
Someone is going to get hurt!
EXPAND NETWORKS ASAP ABOVE ALL IN SUBURBS.
GET AIRPORT LINE GOING. IS A CAP HILL LINE POSSIBLE?
GREAT JOB!
GREAT SERVICE, THANK YOU TO ALL INVOLVED.
HAVE A ? UP THING LIKE PAPER TOWELS AT THE FRONT, I SAW A LADY THROW UP AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO CLEAN HERSELF WITH AND LEFT A MESS.
HAVE ALL SEATS FACING ONE WAY, LIKE DC METRO SO PEOPLE DON'T PUT FEET ON SEATS. LOWER RIDING
TRAINS W/ LESS STOPS LIKE PORTLAND INNER CITY RAIL. BETTER PAY VERIFICATION SYSTEM INSTEAD OF
HONOR SYSTEM. NY AND DC CANNOT ENTER W/O PASS. PORTLAND IS FREE LIKE THE 16TH STREET MALL.
REGULAR ENFORCEMENT AND PRESENCE. TOO MANY TIMES PEOPLE W/FEET ON SEATS, SMOKING, TRASH
ETC.
Have an additional platform for the southbound train at Union Station on the west side of the train. The lines are
crowded and only one side stand on while overflow goes to tracks.
Have the people pay with debit card or credit card.
HAVE THE STOPS MORE COVERED. IT'S VERY COLD DURING WINTER AND SNOW IS EVERYWHERE.
HAVE VALIDATORS AND TICKET MACHINES ON LITE RAIL LEVEL AT COLORADO STATION. PEOPLE ARE IN A
HURRY SOMETIMES AND DON'T REALIZE THEY PASS THE MACHINES ON UPPER LEVEL.
I don't like that as a student I pay for parking because im out of district. I have tried to get my area to pay RTD taxes.
Parking is bad enough at mineral that if you arent there before 8 you need to park somewhere else. And then I have
to pay for it as well. I don't have class till 10:30am but I get there at 7:30 and sleep in my car till I need to leave for
class. It would be more convenient if there was a significant parking structure at mineral, such as one at lincoln.

I have had a terrible expereince trying to purchase online or by phone an annual pass. Have been transferred to four
places in the past two days and no one returns my calls. Most unfortunate since the cost is over $800.
I THINK THE LIGHT RAIL IS DOING A VERY GOOD JOB. FREQUENCY OF OFF DUTY OR NOT IN UNIFORM POLICE
OFFICERS CHECKS SHOULD BE KEPT AT A RANDOM SCHEDULE IN ORDER TO GET THE FREE LOADERS.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IF IT IS POSSIBLE. CAN YOU HAVE LIGHT RAIL EVERY 5 MINUTES OR 7 MINTUES IN THE
MORNING. BECAUSE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WE DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO SIT. BUT AFTER 10 AM IT IS GOOD
TO DO WHAT YOU GUYS WANT TO DO.
If at all possible, adding more cars (wagons) to make more space available for passengers to board at the peak
hours, especially the H-line going to nine-mile.
IT'S PRETTY GOOD, BUT WE GOT PROBLEM ON WEEKENDS SO PELASE IF POSSIBLE, LET THE SCHEDULE BE
LIKE THAT OF WEEKDAYS.
LIGHT RAIL SERVICE IS EXCELLENT.

Customer Complaint Analysis

RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, address and monitor customer complaints on a daily basis.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 4th Quarter of 2012. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.
In 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were consistently meeting the performance goal for
customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD began stricter
enforcement of the fare policy and implemented a new stroller policy which advised passengers with
strollers that they would need to move from the priority seating area if those seats were needed for
disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses and light rail vehicles advising
passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for operators to call out transfer
points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures, customer complaints increased, but
have held steady in 2009, 2010, and 2011 at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding. In 2012, the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints
per passenger boarding. As of the 4th quarter of 2012, RTD and First Transit Longmont are meeting the
goal. The performance statistic for First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver and Veolia is
.0004 complaints per passenger boarding for the 4th quarter of 2012.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL playbacks and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:

Packet Pg. 671

1.C.1

Bus is on time per playback
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
All buses running late due to a snow day
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices.
 RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis that includes a focus on
customer service. The private contractors conduct monthly safety meetings that also include a
segment on improving customer service.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Market Street Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis) to
get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for disabled passengers.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2012, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure By Operator
Passed Up Passenger At Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories were reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and external, that
were impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private contractor
operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – There was a noticeable increase in this category in the first quarter of 2012 which,
in many cases, can be tied to the service reductions effective with the January runboard changes as

Packet Pg. 672

1.C.1

operators attempted to transport the same number of riders on fewer and/or less frequent routes. In
many cases, CAD/AVL playbacks confirm that buses are on route, but running late. However, from the
passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show.
Bus Early – Playbacks for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. On-time
performance statistics for the 4th quarter of 2012 show just 3.1% of all time point observations were in
the “early” category.
Bus Late – There was a noticeable increase in this category in the first quarter of 2012 which, in many
cases, can be tied to the service reductions effective with the January runboard changes as operators
attempted to transport the same number of riders on fewer and/or less frequent routes. Improving ontime performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues.
Careless Driving/Operator – On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed to determine if operators
are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition, all of the private contractors have “G-force
activated” video recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart Drive) installed on their buses. These incidents
are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to
improve driving performance.
Discourtesy/Operator – In the majority of cases, the investigation into these complaints proves the
operator not at fault. Video evidence usually confirms that the operator followed proper procedures and
treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown enforcing policies (fares,
strollers, inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a negative
manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future.
Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. The
4th quarter 2012 statistics show complaints in this category average 11 per month for RTD and the
private contractors combined. Again, investigation into these complaints usually shows the operator not
at fault.
Fare Dispute – This category showed dramatic increases in 2009 and 2010 following the renewed
enforcement of the RTD fare policy. 2011 numbers were consistent with 2010, and the average
number of complaints in 2012 shows a slight decline from 2011. Many complaints indicate passengers
are simply not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies.
Improper Procedure/Operator – Some of these complaints are related to the enforcement of the fare
policies. Other complaints relate to the issues that arise when disabled passengers and passengers with
strollers compete for use of the priority seating area. RTD and the private contractors are in the process
of developing a campaign to 1) be more firm with passengers with strollers to ensure that disabled
passengers have priority in the priority seating area, 2) to encourage all passengers to be more
accommodating so that everyone has the opportunity to ride, and 3) provide additional customer service
tools to help operators handle these conflicts

Packet Pg. 673

1.C.1

Incorrect Info/Operator –This category was tracked to identify possible trends with operators providing
incorrect information to passengers. The total numbers in this category remain small (an average of 13
complaints per month for 2012), which indicates this area is not a problem.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – Oftentimes, playbacks for these complaints will confirm buses are on
route and on time. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when the bus arrived.
Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting directly at the
bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a passenger is passed
up due to the bus being full. Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to the Service
Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources will allow.
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

NOTE: RTD experienced reporting difficulties with its TrapezeCom complaint tracking software in 2011.
A number of complaints for some of the operating divisions could not be captured in the summary
reports. The problem was identified and corrected in 2012. However, some of the complaint data for
2011 was lost. Consequently, the 2011 statistics reported in the comparison summary above are
understated and do not provide an accurate representation of the total complaints received for the year
or the average number of complaints received per month.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th Quarter 2012

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the fourth quarter of 2012 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue
to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
First Transit Denver and First Transit Longmont met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents
per 100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. Even though First Transit Commerce City and Veolia
Transportation did not meet this goal for 4th quarter, none of the passenger accidents during 1st,
2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters 2012 were classified as preventable. First Transit and Veolia
Transportation continue to conduct proactive retraining to increase operator awareness of
passenger mobility issues to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.
Increased passenger awareness training continues to be a primary focus for all contractors in this
area.

Packet Pg. 677

1.C.2



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 4th quarter. The contractor organizations place a high
emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local
operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
First Transit Longmont met the target of 88.0% Local On-Time Service in the 4th quarter. First
Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver and Veolia did show continued improvement in ontime performance (OTP) during the 4th quarter. RTD is working with the private contractors to
use the OTP report to identify and campaign routes with on-time performance issues. The
contractors also report that they continue to experience route delays due to construction and
detours. Increased passenger loads and associated boarding delays also contribute to running
behind schedule. The contractors continue to address on-time performance issues with
operators, but always tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to
have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors as a group exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost Service
Maintenance Road Calls in the 4th quarter. Veolia did not meet the year to date goal, but met
this goal during 4th quarter 2012 with 30,000 miles between lost service maintenance road calls.
RTD Staff is closely monitoring Veolia’s improvement to ensure continued progress is made.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0003 Complaints per Boarding. The contractors as a
group did not meet this goal for 4th quarter, and First Transit Commerce City, First Transit
Denver, and Veolia Transportation continue to investigate and address customer complaints with
operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance and automatic vehicle location
software to retrain operators on the importance of good customer service and continue to
address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

Access-a-Ride Quarterly Report – 4th Quarter 2012

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership and revenue hours increased slightly through the 4th quarter of 2012 as
compared to the same period of 2011. Productivity increased from 1.24 to 1.25 passengers per hour.
During the same period, Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 14%. The increased use of Access-a-Cab
by Access-a-Ride passengers continues to allow RTD to provide increased service without an increase in
resources. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership increased 4% compared to the same
period last year.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased slightly (approximately 1%) from the 4th
quarter of 2011 through 4th quarter 2012. Access-a-Ride is approximately 8% under budgeted revenue
hours through the fourth quarter of 2012.
On-Time Performance
On time performance through the fourth quarter of 2012 increased during the same period in 2011. Our
private contractors continue to address on time performance challenges in order to continue meeting and
exceeding this standard of performance.
Customer Complaints

Packet Pg. 681

1.C.3

Complaints per passenger increased through the 4th quarter of 2012 as compared to the same period in
2011. However, complaints per passenger were maintained at .0010 as a result of transporting more
passengers in 2012. The highest number of complaints received related to on-time performance. Staff
continues to work to address this issue with the service providers.

Attachment: Complaint Report 4th Qrt 2012 (1526 : Access-a-Ride Update 4th Quarter 2012)

The following chart outlines the number and type of complaints filed against the Access-aRide Service per Provider.

An analysis of this report reconfirms that the highest percentage of complaints relate to
our On Time Performance. There are several steps that staff continues to undertake in
order to improve this performance standard. We continue to meet with carrier dispatch
personnel and developing policies and procedures that will assist the call center with driver
call offs and trips redistribution. In addition, the enforcement of our 6 minute boarding
policy which asks passengers to board their vehicle within 6 minutes of its arrival within
their pick up window has improved overall on time performance.

Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and
Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Project
Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project is replacing a 1993-era radio and dispatch system. The
radio system had to be replaced because of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules that
narrowed the bandwidth of radio channels. The old CAD/AVL system was tightly integrated with the
radio system.
RTD joined a state-wide public safety radio network, saving money and improving coverage over an RTD
owned and operated system. INIT, Innovations in Transportation was selected as the CAD/AVL vendor.
In 2012, the CAD/AVL and Radio Replacement Project completed the radio-only deployment for Light
Rail, Transit Police, Paratransit and non-revenue vehicles. The CAD/AVL central system was factory
tested and installed. System integration testing was completed and mini-fleet testing started. About
54% of the fixed-route bus fleet has been installed.
Completion of testing is delayed pending a few missing features that are scheduled for delivery later this
month. Bus installations were originally scheduled for completion in December 2012. However, the bus
installations take significantly longer than the vendor had projected. Onboard installation rates have been
steady over the past month. Projections are that bus installations will be completed in August. Below is
a capsulated summary that is followed by a list of current and upcoming activities.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Smart Card Program is successfully gathering taps for EcoPass and CollegePass riders. For the
month of January approximately 600,000 taps were recorded and in February, over 1.1M taps were
recorded. The Smartcard Customer Service Center, (Celina, Inc.) continues to distribute new cards upon
request, issue replacement cards and answer riders’ questions as they arise. Nearly 140,000 cards with
individual pictures have been produced and distributed.
All bus installations are completed. There are a variety of problems with about 5% of the fleet and
those problems have been documented. RTD staff and Xerox are in the process of working on those
vehicles to implement solutions.
All one-hundred-nine Light Rail validators have been installed and are operational. Upon agreement with
Denver Downtown Partnership, two additional validators will be installed by April 2013 at 16th/California
and 18th/California.
The RTD Network Team and SCADA Team are working together to connect the validators to the existing
network for the Ticket Vending Machines (TVM). Validators for West Corridor have arrived and
installation is coordinated with the installation of the TVMs. Additional validators for expansion of
existing stations, as needed, are expected to be delivered by March 31, 2013. An RFP will be going out
to bring on a work order contractor to be on-call to install additional validators or relocate any validators
as needed.
The Fare Inspector software used to confirm that passengers have tapped prior to boarding is
functioning sporadically and requires adjustments that are currently being addressed by Xerox. Fare
inspectors continue to operate in an “educate & inform” mode and will transition to enforcement of the
smart card tapping in the near future.
RTD staff conducted a planning meeting with Safeway and will be meeting with King Soopers in March
to plan the installation and roll-out of electronic Smart Card Retail Point of Sale Terminals (RPOS) at their
stores to sell RTD passes and load stored value in the fall of 2013. With these stores, there will be
approximately 140 locations throughout the region for riders to add value to their cards. Planning for
Phase 2 of the program is in full-swing.
The Board has previously approved several fare changes and administrative policies regarding the
implementation of Smart Card. The Smart Card Program Team will continue to add policy and
procedures to this list and distribute to The Board as needed.
In February, Gary Googins accepted a position outside of RTD. The program has been transitioned to an
interim Program Manager who will train a newly hired Program Manager over the next several months.
Due to the transition some dates have shifted slightly. The schedule continues to be evaluated to ensure
adequate timing for a successful Phase 2 launch.

4th Quarter 2012 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Information

DISCUSSION
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of October, November, and December.
These tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare
evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police
officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare

evasion. This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace
officers have the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.

Purpose
•

Customer satisfaction research has a long history and has proven a reliable indicator of:
– Lifetime customer value
– Frequency of use of a service
– Forgiveness of service issues

•

At RTD the Customer Satisfaction research is used to:
– Provide key information on who our customers are and how they use the service:
• Payment method
• Trip purpose
• Frequency of riding
• Other RTD services that are used or not used
– What aspects of the service have the greatest influence on customers’ overall
perceptions and how well RTD performs on those factors

•

We also use information from the surveys to:
– Track service over time
– Monitor the success of improvement efforts
– Compare service types or service areas
– Prioritize projects

Key Findings - Bus
•Operator performance is a highlight of bus service.
•Convenience scores slightly declined as a result of decreases in satisfaction with
weekend and evening service availability.
•Availability of bus shelters and the cleanliness of those shelters bring down
comfort factor ratings. However, on-vehicle comfort factors are more important to
customers and are evaluated more favorably.

Key Findings – Light Rail
•
•
•

•
•

35% of light rail passengers reported using an RTD bus, other than the Mall Shuttle,
in the 12 months prior to the survey.
Lower ratings for evening and weekend service availability impacted the convenience
factor evaluations.
Lower ratings of protection from bad weather at stations were responsible for the
slight decline in station satisfaction. The cleanliness of stations and safety at stations
are evaluated more favorably.
Somewhat lower ratings of the availability of seats, and lower vehicle interior
cleanliness ratings bring down comfort ratings.
Customer comments indicate that more frequent fare inspections are desired to
address the perception that a some light rail riders do not have a valid fare.
