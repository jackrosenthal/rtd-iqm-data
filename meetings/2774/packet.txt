RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the transfer of $420,140 from the Railway Worker Protection project (10470 to the PLC
Upgrade project (10426).
General Manager’s Goal - Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/ State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
The Railway Worker Protection and Early Warning System project was funded in 2016 to 2017. Early
warning systems are currently the most effective means of protecting right of way workers from trains.
This is an electronic system mounted on all Light Rail trains that in conjunction with the hand held
devices carried by any railway workers will warn both the train operator and the railway worker well in
advance of each other. This project is now complete and ready for closure. There is a little over
$420,000 remaining in this project. The original project budget of $1,546,650 was based on 2 quotes
received for $1.3M and $2.8M. Ultimately the contract was awarded to Protran Technology for
$1,126,510, leaving $420K remaining in this project.
DISCUSSION
The Program Logic Controller (PLC) project was budgeted in 2015 and was intended to purchase
controllers for 17 substations on the Southeast Corridor. The controllers have reached the end of their
useful life, are obsolete, and are no longer available.
The project was delayed because during the R line construction of the substations, new controllers were
being installed as part of the project. Since these were new controllers, RTD wanted to see how they
would work and determine if these were the best controllers to install on the Southeast Corridor.
Ultimately, it was determined that the new controllers would be cost prohibitive due to the amount of
rewiring that is required.
Since estimating the cost in 2015 there has been a price increase for controller boards, therefore
requiring the budget transfer to fully fund the PLC upgrade project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds are available from the Railway Worker project.

ALTERNATIVES
 It is recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $420,140 from the
Railway Worker Protection project (10470 to the PLC Upgrade project (10426).


Don’t approve the transfer. This is not recommended as there will be a shortfall of funds in the
PLC project and not all of the controllers on the Southeast Corridor will be able to be replaced nor
will there be any spare parts.

Core Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management

Task Goal #1 - Fiscal Sustainability

Background
In September of 2015 the Board of Directors instructed Staff to form a Pass Program Working Group
(PPWG) to help comprehensively review and recommend changes to pass programs in collaboration with
the Affordable Fares Taskforce. The working group included members of RTD staff and external
stakeholders representing schools, businesses, municipalities, neighborhood groups and advocacy
organizations. The board approved the following guiding principles to focus the working group: brand
loyalty, convenience, cost-effectiveness, equitable access, increased ridership, an ability to meet
strategic budget plan targets, revenue certainty and simplifying rider-operator interactions.
Staff convened 12 full working group meetings in twelve months. Staff advertised each working group
meeting to the public, inviting public comment at the beginning of each meeting to help inform the
working group as they developed their recommendations.
The group formulated several options, all of which were modeled by a consultant for their impact on
total fare revenue and ridership. After the working group reached consensus, staff provided an overview
of the group’s recommendation to the Board in March of this year. Staff has since conducted an
operational analysis of the PPWG recommendation and at the direction of the Board, developed a draft
fare change proposal that included two additional options.
Discussion
In May and June, staff presented the Board with three alternatives that staff presented to the public for
feedback. Included in each of the options were the following elements as recommended by the working
group:
 3-Hour Pass - Replaces current One-Way Trip with 3-Hour transfer


EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass - Price based upon the previous year’s
utilization



FlexPass - Retain without discount



MyRide - Retain without $0.25 discount

Packet Pg. 6

2.12.B



10-Ride Ticket Book - Retain without 10% discount



ValuPass - Discontinue (purchase 12 individual monthly passes instead)

The three options primarily differed in base fares, discounts for youth, discounts for low-income
individuals and the administration of the Nonprofit Program.
Option 1. No Increase – Option 1 did not increase the base fare. Option 1 did not meet the fare
revenue targets, kept the current 50% discount for youth and kept the current Nonprofit
Program in place.
Option 2. Regularly Scheduled Fare Change – Option 2 increased the Local fare to $2.90, Regional
fare to $5.00 and the Airport fare to 10.00. Option 2 did meet the fare revenue targets,
included the 70% youth discount and kept the current Nonprofit Program in place.
Option 3. PPWG Recommendation – Option 3 increased the Local fare to $3.00, Regional fare to
$5.25 and the Airport fare to 10.50. Option 3 did meet the fare revenue targets, included
the 70% youth discount and the proposed 40% discount for low-income individuals at
185% of the federal poverty level.
In July and August, Staff used various tactics to engage the public regarding the Draft Fare Change
Proposal to include a Telephone Town Hall, eight open house meetings, the RTD webpage, meetings
with RTD advisory committees, a meeting with Neighborhood EcoPass coordinators and a districtwide
telephone survey to identify the public’s preferred option.
As reported to the Board in August, staff received numerous comments. The districtwide telephone
survey identified that residents of the district generally prefer Option 3, the PPWG recommendation. The
qualitative public feedback showed enthusiastic support for the proposed 3-hour pass, low-income
discounts and youth discounts. Those supporting Option 3 like the concept of paying for time rather
than trips, lower fares for low-income people and promoting transit use among youth.
Public feedback also reflected concerns and offerings of caution. Many commenters expressed concern
that the proposed Local and Airport 3-Hour Passes may be among the highest in the country. Similar
concerns were expressed regarding Access-A-Ride fares being too high. Others expressed concern about
the loss of the MyRide and 10 Ride Ticket Book discounts. Many commenters felt fare increases are
unwelcome given current service levels and some missed trips.
Staff used public comment to inform the development of the final recommendation summarized in
Attachment A.
As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), a Title VI equity analysis has been completed
for the fare changes outlined in Attachment A. No Title VI equity concerns were found with the
recommended changes per the RTD Board adopted Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy.
A summary of the key findings are included in Attachment B.
Financial Impact
The 2019 fare policy changes outlined in Attachment A are forecasted to reach the fare revenue target
levels over the three years (2019-2021).
Alternatives

Packet Pg. 7

2.12.B

1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the recommended fare policy changes, as outlined in Attachment A.
2. Adopt alternative fare policy changes for 2019. This is not recommended as an extensive
analysis was conducted to develop these policies that will meet the objectives of this pass
program study and achieve the fare revenue targets.
3. Do not adopt any fare policy changes for 2019. This is not recommended as our current policies
do not achieve the fare revenue targets and would require reductions in service levels.

Recommended Changes - Pass Programs
Staff recommends the following changes to the EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, CollegePass, FlexPass
and the Nonprofit programs.

EcoPass
Below are the recommended changes to EcoPass:


Annually update the EcoPass Pricing Matrix to reflect the utilization in each Service Level Area
(SLA) group from a full year of smart card tap data. The cash value of all trips (local, regional,
and airport) taken by each SLA group are totaled to determine the new per person rate. 2017
utilization data was used to determine the rates in the matrices for 2019.



Review and update SLA map with every fare adjustment proposed by staff.



Employers with over 3,000 employees are priced based upon the utilization of their individual
organization. The cash value of all trips, local, regional, and airport, are totaled at the applicable
3-Hour Pass rate to determine the next year’s price. First year pricing for employers over 3,000
will be based upon the applicable SLA pricing in group-4.



Contract minimums for SLAs A & B are set at $1,368 (12 times the Local Monthly price), SLAs C &
D are set at $2,394 (12 times the Regional Monthly price).



Price increases for each SLA group and large employer due to utilization-based pricing are to be
capped 20% in 2019 and 2020.



Below are the 2019 EcoPass Pricing Matrix. The pricing matrix for 2020 and 2021 will be updated
to reflect the most recent full year of utilization data.



Master EcoPass Contracts can pass the cost on to employers and employees.

Attachment B
Summary of Key Findings from the Title VI Equity
Analysis Regarding Proposed 2019 Fare Changes
The recommended fare changes did not result in any Title VI equity concerns per the RTD
Board adopted Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy. To complete the fare
equity analysis, the average fare per trip was calculated for each type of fare media,
including pass programs, for all RTD passengers (overall population) and those average fares
were compared to the average fares for low-income and minority riders. It should be noted
that for fare products that are not currently available, the proposed scenario was compared
to existing fares of similar nature (e.g. MyRide/Stored Value, Cash, etc.). The key findings
are described below and a table showing a summary of the results is also provided.
1. When viewing the fare change from a total system perspective, the average fare for the
proposed change for the overall riders is $3.15, for low-income riders it is $2.43 (23%
lower), and for minority riders it is $2.76 (12% lower).
2. Forty five percent of minority riders experience the same increase as the overall rider
population. About 36% of low-Income populations experience the same increase as the
overall rider population.
3. As a whole, low-income and minority populations experienced a significantly lower
increase than the overall rider population. Low-income riders would experience a 9%
increase and minority riders would experience a 15% increase in their average fare per
trip, compared with a 17% increase experienced by the overall rider population.
4. Low-income riders would experience slightly higher increases compared the overall rider
population in several fare categories: Full Fare Monthly, Youth MyRide/Stored Value,
Youth 10-Ride Ticket Book, Senior-Disabled MyRide/Stored Value, and Senior-Disabled
10-Ride Ticket Book, which accounts for about 14% of the low-income population.
5. Minority riders experience slightly higher increases compared to the overall rider
population in several of the fare categories: Full Fare Monthly, Youth 10-Ride Ticket
Book, Senior-Disabled 10-Ride Ticket Book and Ecopass (Neighborhood) which accounts
for 13% of the minority population. However, all of the increases other than the Ecopass
(Neighborhood) are only about 1% higher than overall riders.
6. Minority riders experience smaller increases in some fare categories compared to overall
riders: Full Fare Cash, Full Fare MyRide/Stored Value, Full Fare 10-Ride Ticket Book,
Low-income MyRide/Stored Value, Low-income Day Pass, Youth MyRide/Stored Value,
Senior-Disabled Cash, Senior Disabled MyRide/Stored Value and EcoPass (Business),
which accounts for 43% of the minority population.
7. No fare category resulted in the overall riders experiencing a significantly better outcome
(+5% difference) than minority populations.

2.12.B.b

8. As highlighted in dark red on the table below, two fare categories resulted in overall
riders experiencing a much better outcome than low-income populations.
a. Senior Disabled MyRide/Stored Value fares resulted in a 6% increase for overall
riders, but a 31% increase for low-income populations. Part of this change is due
to the proposed elimination of some discounts in the Nonprofit program for Senior
Disabled riders, and the removal of the pass products. The actual impact of this
change on riders is difficult to assess, as some portion of Senior Disabled riders
receive their fare product for free or at a reduced cost through the Nonprofit
program. Institutional decision making on the part of participating Nonprofit
institutions on how to respond to the discontinuation of discounts and products
would be speculation.
b. Youth MyRide/Stored Value fares resulted in a 38% decrease for the overall rider
population compared to an 18% decrease for low-income riders. However, this
would impact less than 1% of the low-income riders, who would still experience
an overall reduction in their fares

Attachment: SLA Map Explanation (3572 : Adoption of the Preferred Alternative for the 2019-2021 Fare Structure)

2.12.B.c

For EcoPass pricing purposes, the RTD district is broken down into four SLAs: A, B, C,
and D. The SLA areas are determined by the following:


SLA-A: Areas with 1-24 trips between the peak hours of 7:00 am-8:00 am
o Everything on the map that is not coded in blue or red is in SLA-A



SLA-B: Areas with 25-64 trips between the peak hours of 7:00 am and 8:00 am
o There is a 1/3 of a mile buffer around each stop/station
o SLA-B areas are coded in blue



SLA-C: Areas with 65 or more trips between the peak hours of 7:00 am and
8:00 am.
o There is a 1/3 of a mile buffer around each stop/station
o SLA-C areas are coded in red
o Downtown Denver is in SLA-C



SLA-D: DIA airport terminal only

In addition, to updating the map based on the information above, the following changes
were also made.




We removed the call-n-ride boundaries which resulted in some areas being
moved from SLA-B to SLA-A
We updated the map to include information regarding new rail stations
We removed old corridors which didn’t follow the standards above such as:
o Colfax
o Broadway in Denver
o Broadway in Boulder
o Colorado Blvd.

• Current fare policy has allowed for discount stacking resulting in higher
revenue loss with minimal ridership gains.
• Staff proposes to limit discount stacking to the FTA mandated discount for
seniors (65 years old and up) and individuals living with disabilities.
• The FTA mandates a 50% discount for senior and individuals living with disabilities on
all fare products available to the general public (49 CFR Part 609).
• E.g. a senior can get an additional 50% off the already discounted 10-Ride Ticket Book

or its designee concerning the lease of parking spaces in the Sheridan Station Garage according to the
“Agreement Parameters” listed in the Discussion section of this report.
This recommendation addresses one of the General Manager’s 2018 Goals: Strategic Goal #1 – Fiscal
Sustainability.
BACKGROUND
RTD opened the Sheridan Station Garage on the W Line in 2013 with 800 spaces. Actual average
weekday utilization for April 2017-March 2018 stood at 167 spaces, or 21%. On June 22, 2018, RTD
received an Unsolicited Proposal for Joint Development of Real Property from Aaron Miripol of the Urban
Land Conservancy (ULC). The proposal seeks to lease up to 120 spaces in the W Line’s Sheridan Station
Garage. The spaces would be used by residents of a new, 100% affordable housing development to be
constructed to the west of the garage on privately owned land.
Per the procedure governing RTD’s response to unsolicited proposals, the proposal was deemed legally
feasible by the RTD legal department and was subsequently distributed to a staff review committee, the
members of which were nominated by the Senior Leadership Team. The committee found that the
proposal had technical and financial merit and adhered to the TOD Evaluation Guidelines, which were
approved by the RTD Board in February 2018. Having determined that the proposal had potential, RTD
solicited alternate proposals for use of the garage. During the 30-day notice period, no alternate
proposals were submitted. The review committee therefore found that the original proposer was the
preferred developer and recommended to the General Manager that he seek authorization from the RTD
Board to enter into exclusive negotiations with ULC.
DISCUSSION
In determining whether the proposal to lease spaces in the Sheridan Station Garage had merit, the
review committee employed the principles and factors laid out in the TOD Evaluation Guidelines. The
findings were as follows:
TOD Evaluation Guidelines Principles
 The project would be budget positive, as ULC would pay rent for the spaces.

2.12.C






The project is likely to increase ridership at the station by enabling a higher number of residents
directly adjacent to the station.
The project is a lease, not a sale.
The project abides by the Parking Guiding Principles (PGP). Specifically, the PGP require RTD to
evaluate all decisions on parking based on the impacts to ridership and the financial, operational,
and capital benefits to RTD, which is accomplished through the TOD Evaluation Guidelines.
The project has at least a neutral effect on Safety/Security, and may have a positive effect by
providing more activation and “eyes on the street.”
The project has jurisdictional support.

TOD Evaluation Guidelines Factors
 The project will provide a limited amount of revenue to RTD.
 The project is expected to have a positive effect on ridership, particularly because residents of
affordable housing tend to use transit more than residents of market-rate housing, and because
the leased spaces will be confined to the top level of the garage where they will not
inconvenience RTD patrons.
 The project will have minimal effect on transit facility infrastructure.
 The project reduces RTD maintenance expenditures as the lessee would take on snow removal on
the top floor of the garage.
 The project has strong jurisdictional support by the City and County of Denver and the City of
Lakewood due to the creation of affordable housing.
 The project has no effect on RTD operations.
 The project has a neutral or positive effect on Safety/Security, as described above.
 The project has a limited positive effect on Amenities/Access as the lessee is expected to install
sidewalks and landscaping on private land adjacent to the garage.
 The project has a very positive effect on community facilities and affordable housing by enabling
more affordable housing to be constructed adjacent to transit.
 The project has a positive impact on RTD’s brand image, showing RTD to be a partner in the
community.
Given that the project meets all the requirements of the TOD Evaluation Principles, and its effects on the
Factors are either positive or neutral, the review committee found that the proposal had merit and would
be beneficial to RTD.
Agreement Parameters
Therefore, understanding the position of RTD as described in this Board Report, the Board authorizes the
General Manager to negotiate and execute one or more agreements with ULC concerning the lease of
spaces in the Sheridan Station Garage within the following parameters:




The initial term of the lease will be up to 19 years with options to renew.
The lease must contain amendment and termination provisions in the event that RTD needs the
spaces for transit purposes.
The parking spaces must be leased for at least the greater of Fair Market Value or RTD’s current
maintenance costs.

Packet Pg. 41

2.12.C





RTD bond counsel must approve the final terms of the lease to ensure the terms comply with
federal tax law and any other requirements of the Certificates of Participation that financed the
construction of the garage.
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) must concur with the terms of the lease.

In conclusion, of utmost consideration is that RTD maintains control of the garage and protects its use
by RTD patrons. Further, the direction regarding RTD revenues and expenses laid out in this report
assures that RTD will benefit financially from this agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial cost to RTD for this agreement with ULC. Any financial impact to RTD from this
agreement will be positive.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Finance Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute one or more
agreements with Urban Land Conservancy (ULC) or its designee concerning the lease of parking
spaces in the Sheridan Station Garage according to the “Agreement Parameters” listed in the
Discussion section of this report.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to negotiate and execute one or more agreements with Urban Land Conservancy (ULC) or its
designee concerning the lease of parking spaces in the Sheridan Station Garage according to the
“Agreement Parameters” listed in the Discussion section of this report.
This action is not recommended because it will deprive RTD of revenues and create barriers for
the development of affordable housing in the District. Accepting the Recommended Action holds
minimal risk for RTD.
