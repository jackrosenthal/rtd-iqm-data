2018

INFORMATION
Please find the RTD Quarterly Performance Report for the 2nd Quarter of 2018 below.
DISCUSSION
The following is an overview of the performance measures of RTD operations for the 2nd Quarter of
2018. Specific information regarding RTD fixed route contracted bus service, Special Service and
Access-A-Ride is contained in a separate report in this month’s board packet.


PREVENTABLE ACCIDENTS
o Bus Operations – RTD Bus Operations met the goal of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle Accidents
per 100,000 miles through the 2nd Quarter of 2018
o Rail Operations – RTD Rail Operations met the goal of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle Accidents
per 100,000 miles through the 2nd Quarter of 2018



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
o Bus Operations – RTD Bus Operations met the goal of ≤ .06 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles through the 2nd Quarter of 2018



PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS

Maintenance inspections through the 2nd Quarter of 2018.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE

performance through the 2nd Quarter of 2018. RTD Bus Operations did not meet the goal of
92% on-time performance for on our regional service. Traffic delays, road construction,
service frequency and other delays outside of RTD’s control did impact our ability to meet this
goal. RTD Bus Operations continues to work on strategies to improve reliability on our
regional service.

2nd Quarter of 2018.



MILEAGE BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
o Bus Operations - RTD Bus Operations met the goal of 30,000 miles between lost service road
calls through the 2nd Quarter of 2018.



PASSENGER COMPLAINTS AND COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
o Bus Operations - RTD Bus Operations met the goals of ≤10-day response time to customer
complaints and the .0004 complaints per boarding through the 2nd Quarter of 2018.



RESPONSE TIME TO EMERGENCY DISPATCH CALLS
o Bus Operations - RTD Bus Operations met the goal of ≤20-seconds average response time to
Emergency Dispatch Calls through the 2nd Quarter of 2018.



MAINTAIN BUS OPERATOR/MECHANIC HEADCOUNT WITHIN AUTHORIZATION
o Bus Operations - RTD Bus Operations did not meet goal of ≤ 5.0% vacancy rate in bus
operator positions or the ≤ 7.5% vacancy rate for bus mechanic positions. The competitive
employment market and low unemployment has created a challenge in both
recruiting/retaining. RTD continues our initiatives toward enhancing our recruiting and work
environment. The board approved the new Collective Bargaining Agreement and RTD began
seeing an increase in the number of recruits and in improved retention in the 2nd Quarter of
2018. RTD hired 147 new bus operations through the 2nd Quarter of 2018. There were 108
separations. 17 of those operators retired after 20+ years of service to the District. Six
operators were promoted to other positions in the District; and 13 went to other Union
positions in the District to include becoming rail operators.



ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
- The impact from the new CBA Agreement
 Work condition improvements in the area of increased number of straight runs to
60% on weekdays and 75% on weekends, 13-hour maximum spread time and
improvements in recovery time for operators creates a demand for more operators.
While total service hours for May and August are lower than 2017 – we have 19
additional runs to fill.
 Salary and work environment improvements have improved both recruitment and
retention.
- Mandates
 RTD continues to request volunteers or mandate operators for a sixth day of work
on a consistent basis. The numbers through the 2nd Quarter of 2018 are trending
down from last year – both in the month-to-month and year comparison.
 Special events and bus bridge support do impact our need to mandate.
- Recruiting and Retention
 RTD has experienced an increase in class sizes (new class sized range from 10-20
students per class).
 Since the new pay increase, graduation rates have improved to 90% in bus
operations. HR has improved the screening process and increased applications has
expanded our employee options.
 The number of operators hired to operators separating is the best mid-year number
in recent history.
- Efforts underway to improve workforce stability and continue to reduce service loss
 RTD Operations continues to work with our partners throughout RTD to recruit and
retain employees. RTD staff (operations, communications, and HR) have attended




numerous job fairs and RTD employment promotion events. This included special
events such as Juneteenth, People’s Fair, Pride Fest and various county programs.
RTD maintenance continues to serve as expert advisors to various technical school
boards and conducts recruiting seminars throughout the region.
Retention: Improved pay, work schedules and reduction of mandating has improved
both morale and retention. Continuing commitment to better internal
communication through the following initiatives: Represented employee email;
improved mentor programs; buddy system programs; “Welcome to the Division”
programs for new or transferring staff members; “Behind the Radio” radio
dispatcher visits to the division to meet with employees; improved employee
recognition programs and celebrating success with staff.

Attachment: Service Loss Memo 9 11 18 (3558 : Service Availability 9 11 18)

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.53% of all scheduled hours of
bus service in August 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons showed a
slight decrease for the month of August over the same time last year. The overall year to
date number shows an increase over last year. Details as follows:
August 2018 – 163.00 hours
August 2017 – 774.81 hours
Year to date number 2017 – 2,511.84 hours
Year to date number 2018 - 9,155.01 hours

While RTD did provide in excess of 99.53% of all scheduled hours of service in the
month, it was necessary to cover 2,743 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 21,944 hours of service being
provided by a “6th day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours
provided by our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev.

ways to continue to improve recruitment and retention among bus operators.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: September 5, 2018

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

September 4, 2018

Board Meeting Date: September 11, 2018

Subject:

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 2nd
Quarter 2018

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the 2nd Quarter of 2018 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 2nd Quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize
bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators.
The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings,
through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in
the 2nd Quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal but improved to 0.27 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles compared to 0.31 during the 1st Quarter. Three of the eleven Passenger
Accidents that occurred through the 2nd Quarter were classified preventable. All of the bus
operators involved in Passenger Accidents were provided retraining on the proper procedures for
boarding and alighting passenger safely. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness
of passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of Passenger
Accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance Inspections
completed as scheduled in the 2nd Quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal with 94.6% of
Preventive Maintenance Inspections completed through the 2nd Quarter 2018. Deficiencies were
identified in Transdev’s Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality Control (QC)
practices. Revised procedures have been implemented to address these issues. Transdev’s PMI
compliance during July 2018 was 100%. Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the
contractor operations to ensure PMIs are completed on time.

1.C.3



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
Transdev, First Transit Longmont and First Transit Denver met the target of 88% local on-time
service with 87.4%, 89.6% and 86.8% on-time performance in the 2nd Quarter. First Transit
Commerce City (84.4%) did not meet the goal due, in part, to the high number of new operators,
unexpected detours, and traffic. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes
and operators with low on-time performance with a strong focus on first-time point departures.
On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing
routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 88% on-time performance.
Running time issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 miles between lost service
maintenance road calls in the 2nd Quarter. Transdev did not meet the goal during the 2nd
Quarter 2018. Deficiencies were identified in Transdev’s Preventive Maintenance Inspection
(PMI) and Quality Control (QC) practices. Revised procedures have been implemented to address
these issues. Competitive Services staff continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure
Transdev is addressing this area by completing PMIs on-time; working off defects in a timely
manner; monitoring repeat issues; providing additional training for mechanics; and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleet.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 Complaints per
Boarding in the 2nd Quarter. First Transit Denver (.0005), First Transit Commerce City (.0006) and
Transdev (.0007) did not meet the goal. Complaints per Boarding continue to reflect the difficulties
experienced due to operator shortages which resulted in a high number of bus late and bus no show
complaints. The contractors continue to investigate and address customer complaints with operators.
The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving
customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should help
address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue to address complaint trends with all
operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors have implemented bus operator wage increases and continue to take a variety of
additional actions over and above contract requirements to address their operator hiring/retention
challenges which include hiring bonuses, incentives to take on additional work, employing a fulltime recruiter, and mentoring programs.

Subject:

Customer Complaint Analysis - 2nd Quarter
2018

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 2nd Quarter of 2018.
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2017.

Also

As noted in previous reports, over the past few years the implementation and enforcement of a variety
of policies and operating requirements have impacted the number of customer complaints received.
Examples of the policies and operating requirements that have impacted customer complaints include
securement area/priority seating issues, fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability, introduction of
SmartCards and day passes, and changes to bus service associated with the implementation of the
University of Colorado A Line and B Line commuter rail service and the W Line and R Line light rail
service.
Accordingly, based upon recommendations from RTD staff, the Board of Directors has made
modifications to the performance goal for customer complaints to account for these factors. In 2014,
the performance goal was set at .0004 complaints per passenger boarding and has remained at that
level since then.
The “Complaints per Passenger Boarding” for the District as a whole (local bus operations) for the 2nd
Quarter of 2018 was .0005. The “Complaints per Passenger Boarding” for the same period in 2017
was .0004. The RTD operating divisions (Boulder, East Metro and Platte) combined and First Transit
Longmont met the goal for the 2nd Quarter of 2018. First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver,
and Transdev did not. The primary generator for increases in customer complaints during this time
period was the lack of operators which led to dropped service and buses running late.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
 Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
 Operator followed proper procedure
 Passenger presented insufficient fare
 Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
 Passenger presented an expired transfer
 Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
 Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
 There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the training
is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings wherein they
discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station the
first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some refreshers on
station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition, Colorado
School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to
improve RTD service for passengers with disabilities.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post commendations
on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of recognition.
RTD increased operator wages effective March 1, 2018, and the Contractors increased operator wages
effective April 1, 2018. Both RTD and the Contractors have seen an increase in applicants and
employee retention. Hopefully, the increases in headcount will help reduce the amount of dropped
service and the associated complaints.

Historically, and in 2018, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:








Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop

All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 2nd Quarter 2018: The complaints in this category increased 77.6% compared to
the same period in 2017. RTD and the private contractors continue to struggle with operator shortages
and the resulting impact on service delivery. RTD and the private contractors are maintaining their focus
on reducing operator vacancies, ensuring timely pull-outs and providing service per published schedules.
The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 9.5 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017
was 5.35 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category decreased 2.8% compared to the same
period in 2017. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 27

1.C.6

YTD average in this category for 2018 is 4.47 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017
was 4.6 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 7.6% compared to the same period
in 2017. This category has also been impacted by the operator shortages. However, occasional
improvements to staffing have resulted in periodic improvements in this category. Improving on-time
performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; and service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 7.64 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2017 was 7.09 complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 6.7% compared to
the same period in 2017. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks
are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition,
RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart
Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to
be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns
are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 3.68
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 3.45 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 7.0% compared to the
same period in 2017. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 7.72 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2017 was 7.22 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 26.2% compared to the same
period in 2017 (from 42 complaints to 53 complaints). Investigation into discrimination-related
complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 0.29
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 0.23 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category decreased 9.5% compared to the same
period in 2017. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment presented challenges for some
customers. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2018 is 0.94 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017
was 1.04 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 20.1%
compared to the same period in 2017. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2018 is 6.96 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 5.8 complaints per day.

Packet Pg. 28

1.C.6

Incorrect Info/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 1.5% compared to
the same period in 2017 (from 65 complaints to 66 complaints). The combined efforts of the General
Superintendent of Transportation, Operations Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street
Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with up-to-date information to answer
customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in the category for 2018 is 0.36
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2017 was 0.36 complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 2nd Quarter 2018: Complaints in this category increased 19.7%
compared to the same period in 2017. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (93 of the total 2,099 = 4.4%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, and as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2018 is 11.6 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2017 was 9.69 complaints per day.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
Customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can continue to
improve the quality of service provided. Additionally, the results of the 2014 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(very poor) to 5 (excellent), RTD bus service received high ratings in the following operator-related
categories:








exceptions not addressed are noted and reviewed during the next visit to ensure exceptions have been
corrected.
Scheduled visits for the contractors are no less than quarterly and on-going on an as-needed basis. This
audit schedule was implemented in March of 2016.

Quarterly Board of Directors Report
Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Second Quarter ~ April 1 through June 30, 2018

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

On-Board Enforcement

Transit security officers are assigned to Light Rail and Commuter Rail to check for proper fare and to provide
security. The table below shows how many patrons were contacted for the quarter and the percentage of
patrons that did not present valid fare. There is also a designated transit security officer fare task force, whose
duties are to only ride light rail vehicles and concentrate on fare related issues throughout the service area.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection

Bus Operations/Bus Stops

The following chart lists the number arrests made on buses by police officers by month. Arrests include citations
issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is an additional advantage to
the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the authority to check for warrants and
take the appropriate law enforcement action. There have been a total of 406 arrests made on buses in 2018.

Light Rail Operations

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.

Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors, dispatch
logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
