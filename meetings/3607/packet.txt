BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Senate Bill 24-032 Support Position

February 22, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
February 27, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a support position on Senate Bill 24-032 (SB32), Methods to
Increase Transit Use.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD developed its Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program to serve as a guiding document for staff to
pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A Legislative Program serves as a living document
that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy
positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
SB32 was introduced by the Colorado Senate on Wednesday, January 10, 2024, heard in the Senate
Transportation and Energy Committee on Monday, February 5, 2024, and referred as amended to the
Senate Finance Committee. The full text of the Preamended version of the bill, which depicts the bill as
introduced and incorporates the amendments approved by the Senate Transportation and Energy
Committee that will be considered by the full Senate at a later date, is appended as Attachment A.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends the Board of Directors support SB32 in alignment with RTD’s Community Value
Strategic Priority.
SB32 extends the Ozone Season Transit Grant Program that is set to expire July 1, 2024, creates a
grant program to fund zero-fare for youth programs statewide, and creates an exploratory committee to
produce a viable proposal to create, implement, and administer a statewide transit pass (exploratory
committee).
RTD participated in the Ozone Season Transit Grant Program in 2022 and 2023, which program funded
the Zero Fare for Better Air initiative. SB32 moves the administration of the grant program from the
Colorado Energy Office to the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT).

Packet Pg. 4

1.3.A

Regarding the creation of the “youth fare free grant program,” the newly created grant program would
be administered by CDOT. RTD is eligible to receive grant program funding so long as the agency offers
uninterrupted year-long zero-fare transit services to individuals 19 years of age or younger within the
service area.
Lastly, the creation of the exploratory committee would be led by CDOT. The exploratory committee
would be comprised of three representatives from among the state’s five largest transit agencies as well
as other representatives outlined in the bill. In performing its work, the committee must take into
consideration Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the American with Disabilities Act of 1990. On
or before July 1, 2026, the committee must submit a proposal to CDOT’s Executive Director and
members of the Transportation Legislation Review Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
SB32 could result in a financial impact to the agency should RTD implement a Zero Fare for Better Air
initiative in 2024 that exceeds the amount of grant funding available through the Ozone Season Transit
Grant Program. Staff intends to return to the Board of Directors to seek approval for a potential future
grant application to receive funding and implement the 2024 Zero Fare for Better Air period.

members of the committee.
In producing a viable proposal for the creation, implementation,
and administration of a statewide transit pass, the committee is required
to solicit input from specified subject matter experts and interested parties
across the state.
The committee is required to submit its proposal for the creation,
implementation, and administration of a statewide transit pass, including
recommendations for any necessary legislation in connection with the
proposal, to the executive director and the members of the transportation
legislation review committee of the general assembly on or before July 1,
2026.
Ozone season transit grant program. The ozone season transit
grant program was created in the Colorado energy office in 2022. Section
2 makes the following changes to the ozone season transit grant program:
!
Relocates the ozone season transit grant program to the
department;
!
Requires the transit association that receives money from
the state and uses the money to make grants to transit
agencies to consider grants that have been or will be
awarded to the transit agency through the youth fare free
transit grant program, created in the bill, when making
grants to ensure that transit agencies do not receive grants
through the ozone season transit grant program for services
that are paid for with grants from the youth fare free transit
grant program;
!
Requires the state treasurer to transfer $7 million to the
ozone season transit grant program fund on July 1, 2024,
and on July 1 of each year thereafter; and
!
Makes the ozone season transit grant program permanent
by repealing the statute that would repeal the ozone season
transit grant program on July 1, 2024.
Youth fare free transit grant program. Section 3 creates the
youth fare free transit grant program in the department to provide grants
to the regional transportation district (RTD) and a transit association to
provide fare free year-round transit services for individuals who are 19
years of age or younger (youth).
To receive a grant, a transit association or the RTD must submit
an application to the department in accordance with the policies
established by the department. A transit association that receives a grant
may use the money to make grants to eligible transit agencies. The
eligible transit agencies and the RTD may use the grant money to provide
operating support for its transit operations and general transit programs,
so long as the eligible transit agency or the RTD provides uninterrupted
fare free year-round transit services for youth riders.
The RTD is required to report to the department and an eligible

transit agency that receives a grant from a transit association is required
to report to the transit association regarding the estimated change in youth
ridership during the year in which fare free services were offered
compared to previous years, any changes that the RTD or the eligible
transit agency would make in how it provides fare free transit services to
youth or in its use of the grant money based on its experiences, and how
the RTD or the eligible transit agency marketed the fare free transit
services for youth. The transit association is required to submit to the
department a summary of the reported information for all eligible transit
agencies that received a grant through the transit association.
The bill creates the youth fare free transit grant program fund
(fund) and transfers $7 million from the general fund to the fund on July
1, 2024, and on July 1 of each year thereafter. The money in the fund is
continuously appropriated to the department for the youth fare free transit
grant program.
The department is required to establish policies governing the
youth fare free transit grant program and to report to the house of
representatives transportation, housing, and local government committee
and the senate transportation committee, or their successor committees,
by December 31 of each year of the program.
Income tax credit for the purchase of a transit pass. For income
tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1,
2029, section 4 creates an income tax credit allowed to any taxpayer in
an amount equal to 30% of the amount spent by the taxpayer to purchase
one or more transit passes for use by the taxpayer during the income tax
year for which the credit is claimed.
To claim the credit a taxpayer is required to include a credit
certificate issued by the department with the income tax return filed with
the department of revenue. The credit certificate that the department
issues must identify the taxpayer and certify that the taxpayer purchased
one or more transit passes for the taxpayer's use during the income tax
year for which the credit is claimed.
The amount of the credit not used as an offset against income taxes
in the current income tax year is refunded to the taxpayer.
No later than January 1, 2025, and no later than January 1 of each
year thereafter through January 1, 2029, the department is required to
provide the department of revenue with an electronic report of the
taxpayers receiving a credit certificate.

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Board Meeting Accessibility Pilot Policy

February 22, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
February 27, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Board and Committee Meeting Accessibility Pilot Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Board Chair
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD complies with Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prevent
discrimination based on disability, as well as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits
discrimination on race, color, and national origin (including language proficiency). These federal laws and
regulatory compliance requirements set forth by the Federal Transit Administration establish provisions
for language access as well as auxiliary aids and services to ensure meaningful public involvement with
persons with disabilities and linguistically diverse communities. This is of relevance with respect to the
meetings of the Board of Directors (Board).
To ensure compliance, all Board meeting agendas are published with the following language:
The following communication assistance is available for public meetings:
Language Interpreters
Sign-language Interpreters
Assisted listening devices
Documents in alternative formats and language translations
Please notify RTD of the communication assistance you require at least 48 business hours in
advance of a RTD meeting you wish to attend by calling 303.299.2307
Currently, the Board Office works closely with the Civil Rights Division to arrange for any requested
language assistance services. The last meeting during which language interpretation services were
provided was the June 2023 Board Meeting before which the Board Office received a request to provide

Packet Pg. 34

1.3.B

Spanish language interpretation. There is a centralized agency-wide budget to pay for the cost of
language assistance service providers within the Civil Rights Division, and the Board Office coordinates
with the Civil Rights Division to have appropriately submitted any language assistance requests for Board
meetings received by the Board Office.
While it is noted that Board meetings are in compliance with Titles II and III of the ADA and Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act, the Board Office has fulfilled requests for Communication Access Realtime
Transcription services to be provided at recent Board and Committee meetings and has paid for those
services from the Board Office operational budget. Additionally, the Board Office has made coordinated
investments from the Board Office budget into information technology hardware, third-party service
providers, and audio/visual (AV) equipment in Board meeting spaces to ensure greater baseline levels of
public accessibility at Board meetings.
The Board Office and the Civil Rights Division surveyed other transit agencies to gain insights into best
practices for providing CART and Spanish translation services. Capital Metro (Austin, TX), Long Beach
Transit (Long Beach, CA), Jacksonville Transportation Authority (Jacksonville, FL), Kansas City Area
Transit Authority (Kansas City, MO), TriMet (Portland, OR), Utah Transit Authority (Salt Lake City, UT)
all provide translation services upon request. Likewise, the above agencies provide CART services upon
request, except for Long Beach Transit which constructed its new board room with embedded closed
captioning technology.
Likewise the Board Office and Civil Rights Division reached out to other local governments to understand
the levels of accessibility those entities provide at their meetings. The City and County of Denver and
Commerce City provide language translation and CART services upon request. The City of Aurora
provides Spanish interpreters automatically at the public comment portion of its city council meetings so
that attendees can provide council comments in Spanish that are translated to English by an interpreter;
if an attendee wishes to have language interpretation available for any other portion of the agenda, they
must request those services in advance. The City of Aurora provides CART services upon request. The
Colorado General Assembly provides CART services upon request.
The Board discussed what it would like to see in a policy during the January Executive Committee
meeting as well as the January full Board meeting. At that time, the Board provided direction to staff to
bring back a pilot policy stating that CART and Spanish language interpretation would be provided at all
Board and committee meetings.
DISCUSSION
Based on additional information gathered following the Board’s discussions in January, the Board Office
is proposing the attached meeting accessibility pilot program policy for 2024, which calls for CART
services and an automatic translation of the CART transcript into Spanish, at all board and committee
meetings. Additional accessibility services will continue to be provided upon request.
The Board is asked to review the proposed policy, discuss its merits, and vote on the proposed policy.

Packet Pg. 35

1.3.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Board Office and Civil Rights Division have sufficient funding allocated for the 2024 fiscal year to
provide accessibility and language assistance services upon request so long as the volume and nature of
those requests mirror historical averages/anticipated requests.
The Board Office estimates the cost of providing CART services with automated Spanish translation for
all anticipated Board and committee meetings in 2024 to be at least $29,100 ($177 per hour).
In anticipation of a policy change, the Board Office has initiated a procurement process for CART
services. The Civil Rights Division has already concluded a procurement process for language access
service providers based on anticipated needs across the agency.

2024 RTD BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING AND COMMITTEE MEETING
ACCESSIBILITY PILOT POLICY

PURPOSE
To provide enhanced accessibility at RTD Board of Director committee and full board meetings,
while ensuring continuing compliance with the federal and state laws and regulations.

POLICY
During the 2024 board and committee meeting accessibility pilot, the Board of Directors, shall
automatically provide remote Communication Access Real Time Translation (CART) services in
English with an automated translation of the CART transcript into Spanish at all of its meetings.
Additional accessibility services, including the provision of language interpreters, sign-language
interpreters, assisted listening devices, documents in alternative formats, and document
translations will continue to be provided upon request. Requests are to be made 48 hours in
advance by contacting the Board Office Executive Manager.

SCOPE
This policy applies to all noticed meetings in 2024 of the Board, including but not limited to: standing
committee meetings, independent audit committee meetings, ad hoc committee meetings, board
study sessions, board retreats, special board meetings, and regularly scheduled board meetings.
During the pilot program the Board Office will work to compile data related to the usage of
accessibility services to provide the Board with additional information with which to make a longterm decision regarding the level of accessibility services it automatically provides at its meetings.

RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board Office will be responsible for ensuring the provision of CART services as outlined above
and that requests for additional accessibility services are met. The Board Office will work closely
with the Civil Rights Division as the subject matter experts.

TIMEFRAME
The pilot program shall be in effect until the board takes further action or December 31, 2024,
whichever is first.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – February 2024

February 22, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2023 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, RTD Board members and staff must be proactive in educating and
informing the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared
goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state, and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on Wednesday, January 24, 2024. This report was prepared
on February 12, 2024, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting
scheduled for Thursday, February 22, 2024.
Federal
Since the last Government Relations report on Wednesday, January 24, 2024, Congress was able to
extend, via a Continuing Resolution, funding for transportation programs administered by the U.S.
Department of Transportation. House and Senate negotiators have reportedly agreed to top-line funding

Packet Pg. 38

1.5.1

figures for the separate appropriation bills, signaling a step in the right direction to accomplish approving
a Federal Fiscal Year 2024 funding bill.
State
At the state level, SB24-032 (SB32), Methods to Increase the Use of Transit, sponsored by Senator
Kevin Priola, Senator Sonya Jaquez Lewis, and Representative Stephanie Vigil, was heard in the Senate
Transportation and Energy Committee on Monday, February 5, 2024. The Board Chair, Second Vice
Chair, and General Manager and CEO all participated in the hearing and provided testimony in support of
programs included in the bill. As reported during the January 2024 Executive Committee meeting,
included in the bill is the creation of an exploratory committee to produce a viable proposal for the
creation, implementation, and administration of a statewide transit pass by July 1, 2026. Second, SB32
moves the Ozone Season Transit Grant Program – the program that funds the Zero Fare for Better Air
initiative – from the Colorado Energy Office to the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and
continuously funds the program. Third, the bill creates a youth fare free transit grant program within
CDOT for which RTD and all other transit agencies in the state are eligible to apply for funding to
implement a zero fare for youth program. This new grant program is continuously funded beginning on
July 1, 2024. Lastly, the bill initially included an income tax credit for individuals, but an amendment
was offered and adopted in committee that removed the credit. As of the writing of this report, the bill’s
expected next hearing in the Senate Finance Committee has not been scheduled. Staff will keep the
Board apprised of further developments.
Potential legislation related to RTD has been circulated by state lawmakers and reported on by media
outlets. Titled “Transit Reform and Governance,” the legislators’ four main areas of policy focus are:
Improve Decision Making and Collaboration with Regional and Local Planning; Support Training for
Transit Operators Across the State; Budget and Reporting Transparency; and Board Reform. RTD staff
are working closely with the Governor’s office, legislators to better understand the purpose and intent.
As of the time this Discussion Item was drafted, no bill related to these topics had been introduced.
Staff will keep the Board apprised should any legislation impacting RTD be introduced.
Local
At the local level, Director Sloan and staff attended the first gathering of the Metro Mayors Caucus in
2024. During the meeting, staff was provided an opportunity to briefly summarize the legislative
concepts outlined in the “Transit Reform and Governance” documents circulated by the state legislators
for potential consideration by the legislature.
On Monday, February 12, 2024, Director Bouquet, the GM/CEO and staff engaged with the Parker Town
Council, further the GM/CEO presented to the Council regarding the agency’s strategic initiatives and the
Partnership Program. Additionally, the GM/CEO and staff fielded questions pertaining to service delivery
and the return on investment for sales and use tax collection for the residents of Parker.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Proposed Amendments to Board Operating Guidelines

February 22, 2024

REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 26, 2019, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2019, which set
forth the RTD Board Operating Guidelines. That resolution calls for the Board to “recommit annually,
during a meeting in the first quarter of each year, to uphold these principles and to amend them as
necessary to reflect current practices.”
DISCUSSION
The Board Office worked with Chair Davidson to make initial recommendations on potential
amendments. The Chair then asked for additional input/recommendations for Secretary Guzman and
Treasurer Bouquet.
The proposed amendments are now coming forward to the Executive Committee for discussion. Upon
further input from the Executive Committee and Board, the proposed amendments will be refined and
brought back at the March meeting of the Executive Committee as a recommended action.
This discussion aligns with the strategic priority of Employee Ownership as the Board has the ability to
model effective professional interaction for the rest of the agency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no fiscal impact to RTD for the Board to review and/or amend its operating guidelines.

BOARD COMMITMENT
Our Board is committed to public transit and the strategic goals of the Regional Transportation
District. In meeting this commitment, we appreciate that the Board adds the greatest value when
it focuses on and helps clarify policy issues and plans, including the policies that underpin capital
and operating budgets. In setting policies and plans, the Board must understand the vision and
mission of RTD and its immediate and future priority objectives for coming years as well as the
long-term strategic plan. The Board appreciates that it must position RTD to be able to respond
flexibly, responsibly, and transparently to unique factors as they present, including the current
organizational shift in focus from capital development to operations and maintenance, challenges
in optimizing service levels in order to meet customer demands, and the introduction of disruptive
transit technologies, in order better to serve our constituents in new and varying ways. As elected
officials, we each represent different districts with differing needs, and we have a responsibility
to each of our constituents and to the overall well-being of the agency as a whole. We also
recognize that this Board, by statute, has both policy-setting and executive functions it must
perform.
BOARD VALUES

value openness in our discussions, diversity of perspectives, and civility in our conversations. We
also place a premium on deliberations that are both efficient and effective. Recognizing that
issues will vary in their complexity, we value timely decision-making.

Re:

RTD Board of Directors Customs Relating to Board Meetings

This memorandum (1) discusses Special Rules of Order, Standing Rules, and Customs
relating to RTD Board Meetings; and (2) sets forth RTD staff’s understanding of the
current Customs relating to RTD Board meetings. (There are no current Special Rules of
Order or Standing Rules adopted by the RTD Board.) Normal rules of order in the Bylaws
can be suspended or supplemented by special rules only by a two-thirds vote, and some
rules cannot be suspended.1 By contrast, standing rules and customs can be revised
going forward, or modified for any particular matter, by majority vote of the Board.2
This memo begins by explaining the purpose and authority for Special Rules of Order,
Standing Rules, and Customs. The meme then discusses the differences between Special
Rules of Order as opposed to Standing Rules and Customs. The memo then sets forth
RTD Board Meeting Customs as currently understood by RTD staff. These Customs
include such matters as:


Voting through RTD’s software system

Participation of Directors by phone in executive sessions
Location and authorization of public videotaping equipment
Time limits and other restrictions on public comments and questions
Recognition of retiring employees
What is “old” and “new” business
Placement of executive sessions when there are multiple Committee meetings

There may be other Customs that apply to RTD Board meetings but that have simply not
yet come to anyone’s attention. This memo will be updated as such Customs are
identified or if and when the Board adopts any Special Rules of Order or Standing Rules.

A. Introduction: Definitions, purposes, and authority for Special Rules of
Order, Standing Rules, and Customs
Special Rules of Order, Standing Rules, and Customs do not replace the RTD Bylaws
themselves, any provisions set forth in Robert’s Rules of Order, or any statutory
requirements such as laws governing executive sessions. Instead, RTD’s Board Bylaws
state:
“The current edition of Robert’s Rules of Order, newly revised, shall govern
parliamentary procedure for the Board and its Committees except as herein provided
or as otherwise provided by law.”3
Robert’s Rules recognizes that neither it nor an organization’s bylaws can address all
procedures that are used for meetings. Robert’s Rules therefore recognizes the roles of
“special rules of order,” “standing rules” and “customs” in filling gaps not covered by an
organization’s bylaws or Robert’s Rules.4 (Robert’s 11th ed., pp. 18-19).
1. Special Rules of Order
Robert’s Rules explains Special Rules of Order as follows:
“The term rules of order refers to written rules of parliamentary procedure formally
adopted by … an organization. … The usual and preferable method … is … to place
in its bylaws a provision prescribing that the current edition of a specified and
generally accepted manual of parliamentary law shall be the organization’s
parliamentary authority, and then to adopt only such special rules of order as it finds
needed to supplement or modify rules contained in that manual.”5
Robert’s Rules notes that when, as with RTD, a source such as Robert’s Rules is
identified as the parliamentary authority “except as herein provided or as otherwise
provided by law,” a special rule of order cannot supersede anything within Robert’s
Rules except by a two-thirds vote.6 Certain rules of order can never be superseded –
such as fundamental principles of parliamentary law7 – but others can be suspended for
a particular matter by a two-thirds vote.
Unanimous consent is a good way to save time by suspending the rules, effectively
creating a one-time special rule. For example, a member may “ask unanimous consent
to suspend the rules” to adopt some non-controversial resolutions before proceeding to
3

RTD Bylaws, Art. XIII (11/29/2016).
Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, pp. 15-19.
5
Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, p. 15.
6
Robert’s Rules, Sec. 2, p. 17; and Sec. 25, pp. 260-267.
7
Examples of such fundamental principles includes the rule that allows only one question to be
considered at a time (note, however, that this rule does allow unanimous consent agendas); and
rules giving the right to vote to a nonmember or an absentee member. Robert’s Rules, Sec. 25,
p. 263. The basic rights of individual members can also not be suspended except through
disciplinary action. Robert’s Rules, Sec. 25, p. 264.

1.5.2.c

another matter, and in doing so “can briefly give sufficient information to enable the
members to vote intelligibly on his undebatable motion.”8 If anyone objects, a formal
motion to suspend the rules is taken up.
2. Standing Rules
Robert’s Rules explains Standing Rules as follows:
“Standing rules … are rules (1) which are related to the details of the administration
of a society rather than to parliamentary procedure, and (2) which can be adopted
or changed upon the same conditions as any ordinary act of the society. An example
of such a rule might be one setting the hour at which meetings are to begin, or one
relating to the maintenance of a guest register. Standing rules generally are …
adopted … individually if and when the need arises. A standing rule can be adopted
by a majority vote … provided that it does not conflict with or amend any existing
rule or act of the society.”9
RTD currently has no Board-adopted Standing Rules: i.e., rules relating to details of
administration of its meetings rather than to parliamentary procedure, adopted by the
Board through motion and majority vote. Instead, RTD’s Bylaws are detailed in
prescribing certain administrative requirements.
3. Customs
Robert’s Rules describes Customs as follows:
“In some organizations, a particular practice may sometimes come to be followed as
a matter of established custom so that it is treated practically as if it were prescribed
by a rule. If there is no contrary provision in the parliamentary authority or written
rules of the organization, the established custom should be adhered to unless the
assembly, by a majority vote, agrees in a particular instance to do otherwise.
However, if a customary practice is or becomes in conflict with the parliamentary
authority or any written rule, and a Point of Order citing the conflict is raised at any
time, the custom falls to the ground, and the conflicting provision in the
parliamentary authority or written rule must thereafter be complied with. If it is then
desired to follow the former practice, a special rule of order (or, in appropriate
circumstances, a standing rule or a bylaw provision) can be added or amended to
incorporate it.”10
The rest of this memo summarizes RTD’s Board meeting Customs as understood by RTD
staff.

B. Customs at RTD Board Meetings
The following are established Customs at RTD Board meetings, as currently identified by
RTD staff. (RTD staff currently knows of no Special Rules of Order or Standing Rules.)
There may be other Customs that apply to RTD Board meetings but that have simply not
yet come to anyone’s attention. This memo will be updated as such Customs are
identified or if and when the Board formally adopts any Special Rules of Order or
Standing Rules.
1. Voting through RTD’s software system
RTD uses a special software system to display the agenda, the current location in the
agenda, Director requests to speak, and Director votes.
a. Unless the Chair of a meeting determines that the software
has malfunctioned, a Director’s vote may not be changed
after votes flash on the screen except by unanimous consent.
RTD employs an electronic voting system intended to ensure that all Board members
vote at the same time, instead of some members basing their votes upon how others
have voted. Once everyone has registered their votes on their computer terminals, the
final tally flashes up on the screen.
RTD’s custom is that the flashing up of the results on the screen constitutes the official
“announcement,” after which a vote may be changed only through unanimous consent.
This Custom is consistent with a primary purpose of the voting software: to prevent
vote-changing and to make the simultaneous “reveal” of all votes on the screen the
official “announcement.” This Custom is also consistent with Robert’s Rules, which
provide that a member may change her or his vote at any time up to when the result is
“announced.” After that, a change may be done only by unanimous consent.
For this reason, it is very important to make sure Board members understand the effect
of a “yes” or “no” vote, especially in votes on amendments or procedural matters.
b. For Committee meetings, Directors attending by phone
should state their vote before the electronic vote is
conducted. Their vote is then added to the result on the
screen, and the Chair states the final vote and result.
c. If the software system is inoperable, for matters involving a
recommended action or another act of a general or
permanent nature, Directors must vote by a roll call vote as
required by the RTD Bylaws.11
RTD Bylaws, Art. V, Sec. 5(a), p. 13. The Bylaws authorize “a roll call or electronically recorded
vote by the Executive Director to the Board …” Shows of hands, voice votes, etc. are only
permitted for other action. RTD Bylaws, Art. V, Sec. 5(e), p. 14.

1.5.2.c

2. Requesting the right to speak through RTD’s software system
a. The Chair should recognize Director requests to speak, or to
ask questions of staff, in the order of speaker requests set
forth in the software system.
b. The Chair may allow reasonable, brief follow-up questions.
c. Once all Directors on the screen have been given the
opportunity to speak at least once, the Chair should ask each
Director attending by phone whether they wish to speak.
d. After all Directors have spoken, the Chair may speak
concerning a matter.
3. Participation of RTD staff in Board and Committee discussions
a. After a staff Recommended Action item is moved and
seconded, RTD staff are customarily asked by the Chair to
provide an introductory explanation of the item without the
need for questions and answers.
b. Subsequent questions by Directors are handled as Director
requests to speak. RTD Board meetings generally allow direct
questions to staff or other Directors, and responses, without
the need to go through the Chair, but the Chair retains
discretion to handle the conduct of comments and questions.
4. Accessibility, including accessible visual aids and recordings
a. Visual aids and recordings at Board meetings should be made
accessible to participants with visual or hearing impairments.
b. Speakers should generally identify themselves by name and
title before beginning to speak.
5. Participation of Directors by phone in executive sessions
a. Directors may not participate by phone in executive
sessions.12
12

At some recent meetings, Directors were allowed to participate by phone in executive sessions.
Upon further review, it appears that Directors have not historically participated by phone in
executive sessions. Participation by phone is problematic in that other attendees cannot verify
that attendance is limited to permitted participants. As with any other custom, the Board could
vote to allow phone participation on a case by case basis. In such case, staff recommends that

6. Location and authorization of public videotaping equipment
a. Public videotaping equipment is only permitted at such
locations as authorized by RTD Transit Police and must not
disrupt the meeting.
7. Time limits and other restrictions on public comments and
questions
a. Public comments are limited to three minutes in length.
b. Questions from the public will not be answered at the
meeting but will be noted for future response.
c. Public officials are allowed to speak first.
8. Recognition of retiring employees
a. Retiring employees are recognized at the start of RTD Board
Meetings.
b. Retirees who are present are generally honored with a
statement by their AGM and/or manager and are invited to
give a brief statement.
9. What is “old” and “new” business
a. “Old business” is limited to the narrow category of nonrecommended action items that have been postponed to a
time certain at a previous Board or Committee meeting.13
b. “New business” is generally limited to Directors’ personal
announcements.14
10. Adding items to the Agenda by request of at least three Board
members
a. Items may be added directly to a regular Board meeting
Agenda by at least three Board members without having to
any Director participating by phone must first state on the record that the Director is listening by
handset or headset (not speakerphone), and that no other persons are present.
13
RTD’s Bylaws specify that recommended action items that are held over or tabled from a
previous meeting are to be taken up under “Recommended Action,” before new items from
committees. See RTD Bylaws Art. V, Sec. 3(c), p. 11.
14
Items added to the Agenda by three Board members are taken up under “Recommended
Action.” See RTD Bylaws Art. V, Section 3(c), p. 11.

first go through a Standing Committee or Executive
Committee.15
11. Placement of executive sessions when there are multiple
Committee meetings
a. Where two Committee meetings are scheduled for the same
meeting, to avoid the need for members of the public and
non-essential staff to leave prior to completion of all other
business, the Committee Chairs may coordinate to arrange
for any executive session(s) to take place at the conclusion of
the joint meeting.
b. The above procedure is subject to any Director making a
Point of Order to require the executive session to take place
in the standard order of business.
12. Safety Moment
a. Each Board and Committee meeting will begin with a Safety
Moment.
13. Pledge of Allegiance
a. Board Meetings (not Committee Meetings) will begin with the
Pledge of Allegiance.
14. Chair’s participation in matters under debate
a. When taking part in the debate on matters before committee
and Board meetings, the Chair of the Board typically does so
sparingly and at the end of the discussion period.
