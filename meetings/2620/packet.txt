Recommendation for Contract Award to HNTB
for FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant
Services

General

Board Meeting Date: August 15, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for a one-year extension with HNTB
Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for Systems Engineering consulting work.
BACKGROUND
In May of 2017, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for professional services for a Systems
Engineering Consultant for FasTracks and Base system capital programs and state of good repair
projects for RTD. This contract will award work and authorize budget based on a work order system.
On 6/27/17 RTD received one proposal from the HNTB Corporation.
RTD put together a team with representation from Purchasing, Civil Rights, Quality Assurance, Systems
Engineering and Program Management to evaluate the proposal submitted by HNTB according to the
following evaluation criteria:
Proposals were evaluated according to the following criteria, listed in descending order of
importance:

The evaluation team rated and scored the HNTB proposal and found them to be fully compliant with all
of the evaluation criteria. Based on the proven performance by HNTB in the proposal on RTD and similar
transit systems nationwide, the evaluation team recommended that RTD move forward with award of
the contract to HNTB for Systems Engineering Consulting services.
DISCUSSION
RTD has used a single Systems Engineering Consultant for FasTracks and Base systems for consistency
and standardization of design. This approach has saved RTD cost and has facilitated the operation and
maintenance of the system. The incumbent Systems Engineering Consultant six-year contract has been
extended once and will have been in place for 12 years by December of 2017. For this reason, RTD
reexamined our needs and advertised for these services in order to secure a Systems Engineering
consultant to complete the FasTracks capital construction program and continue to support RTD’s Base
systems operations and maintenance.

Packet Pg. 3

2.11.A

The selected Systems Engineering Consultant will support RTD’s Systems Engineering staff on managing
the Southeast Rail Line Extension, the North Metro Rail Line, and projects on the RTD’s Base System.
The proposed Scope of Work to be performed under this Contract Award Authorization is as follows:


RTD Base System
˗ Prepare PE stamped construction drawings and specifications
˗ Provide project management and administration
˗ Provide coordination and project control, cost estimating, cost control assistance
˗ Prepare construction drawings and specifications for State of Good repair projects that are in
the SBP such as power switch upgrades, traction power studies, traction power PLC
upgrades, OCS wire replacements, signal improvement projects and stray current
measurement.
˗ Assist RTD in coordination with civil designers and other government agencies as it relates to
System Engineering.
˗ Incorporate design changes as requested by the RTD
˗ Provide CADD and Quality Assurance services as required by RTD



North Metro Rail Line
˗ Review systems submittals and construction design documents submitted by the Contractor
˗ Assist RTD in coordination with civil designers and other government agencies as it relates to
System Engineering
˗ Assist RTD in reviewing the North Metro Rail Line schedule
˗ Assist in cost estimating and negotiations for any systems-related changes including
operations and maintenance
˗ Perform field inspections
˗ Perform quality assurance audits as required by RTD’s Quality Assurance Program



Southeast Rail Extension Project
˗ Review systems submittals and construction design documents submitted by the Contractor
˗ Assist RTD in coordination with civil designers and other government agencies as it relates to
System Engineering
˗ Assist RTD in reviewing the Southeast Rail Extension schedule
˗ Assist in cost estimating and negotiations for any systems-related changes including
operations and maintenance
˗ Perform field inspections
˗ Perform quality assurance audits as required by RTD’s Quality Assurance Program

The contract award will be for a five-year period of performance with an option for a one-year extension.
The DBE goal for this contract was set at 5%. HNTB has committed to meet the 5% DBE goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for project scope to be completed in 2017 is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget for the
FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where HNTB support would be utilized. Funding for
future year’s scope for the FasTracks projects are identified in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation and
the SBP. Projects requiring additional support identified in the 2016 SBP include: power switching on
emergency crossovers, SE corridor state of good repair, traction power substation PLC upgrade, Welton
St intersections warning signs replacement, stray current measurement and reporting and DUS signage.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for
a one-year extension with HNTB Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for
Systems Engineering consulting work.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the System Engineering approach to project
management and design. This is not recommended as RTD does not currently have the specialized
staff to meet the System Engineering needs of the FasTracks Program and Base System. Selection of
alternative two could delay implementation of the FasTracks Program and state of good repair on the
Base system.

Board Meeting Date: August 15, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).
BACKGROUND
Wells Fargo, as the District’s commercial bank, requires prompt notification of all modifications in the
authorized signatories on the District’s various bank accounts. In order to reflect any changes in District
personnel and the election of new Board officers, the Agreement is updated at least annually and
periodically as otherwise required.
DISCUSSION
The attached recommended Agreement has been modified from the previously approved Agreement only
to reflect the addition of a new checking account which will be used solely for paying invoices related to
the winding down of the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA). Funds deposited in this
account will be transferred to RTD from the DUSPA. The creation and use of this account will enable
RTD to clearly account for the remaining DUSPA funds as DUSPA’s remaining obligations are paid over
time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommended Board action poses no financial impact to the District.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the
“Agreement”).
2.
Modify the attached Agreement.
Do not adopt the attached Agreement.
