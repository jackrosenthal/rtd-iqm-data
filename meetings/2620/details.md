## II. August Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Hoy reviewed the Board Meeting agenda and asked whether any retirees would be in attendance.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, responded that Gerald Stoll, Lead Service Desk Technical Specialist, was the only retiree who had committed to attend.

Chair Hoy noted the agenda contained only two unanimous consent items, one regarding a contract with HTNB and the other for bank signature authorizations, and no recommended actions. He said both items should be straightforward and no executive session was scheduled.

Chair Hoy asked which RTD representatives would be required to sign off on the bank signature authorization resolution.

Director Menten said that the resolution included in the packet showed that the entire Executive Committee would be required to sign. She asked whether the authority for the new account granted under the resolution would still fall under the purview of the Financial Administration & Audit Committee.

General Manager Genova confirmed that the authority would still rest under the committee and noted that the account would be used to take care of remaining commitments and would fall in line with rest of the agency’s financial reporting.

Chair Hoy likened the account to an escrow account used in the purchase of a house.

Director Menten asked for confirmation that RTD had no other unexpected obligations for the maintenance of Denver Union Station other than what had previously been stated.

General Manager Genova confirmed that the account would be used for normal upkeep of the property.

Director Menten asked for confirmation that the City and County of Denver would take care of the roads in front of and behind Union Station.

Chair Hoy said that RTD does not pay for road maintenance unless the agency owns the road.

General Manager Genova confirmed but noted that RTD does maintenance on the 16th Street Mall and performs snow removal in certain areas.

Motion: Chair Hoy made the motion to approve moving the August 15th Board agenda to the full Board.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

## III. Other Matters

Chair Hoy said he had spoken with Ms. McManus, Board Office staff, and General Manager Genova to make sure that in 2018 the Board would be efficient its time and with meetings on Tuesday nights. He said the General Manager would be instructing his team to look at consolidating obligations in order to get away from convening for 15-minute meetings. He said that is the focus and that the calendar is being built for next year.

Director Deadwyler said she hoped that doing so would not create a pile-up on the next month’s meeting agenda, causing the meeting to last half the night.

Chair Hoy agreed. He said that the Board would try to make meetings more efficient and that the committee could meet on any off Tuesday if issues arise requiring a meeting.

General Manager Genova said that he had looked at the following year and asked all of the Assistant General Managers to be strategic. He said they know when items will come up and has asked them to look 18 months out to avoid having overly large agendas. He said that the Operations and Customer Service (Ops) and Financial Administration and Audit (Finance) meetings should be regular monthly meetings, because there are always items to report. He said the thinking is that the Government Relations (GR) and Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee (PCP FT) Meetings could be moved to every other month and that Civil Rights Meetings could be held on the nights those two committees are scheduled to meet.

Chair Hoy said the agency would be organizing its meetings better. He said the Board does not want to meet if staff has nothing to talk about.

Director Deadwyler asked whether all recommended actions are critical.

General Manager Genova said it depends on the timing and that staff would try to be conscientious. He said that, for example, the September 5 meeting had already been canceled due to lack of discussion topics.

Ms. McManus said that September looked to be a light month even after the cancellation of the September 5th meeting and said that the following meetings would not be overburdened. She mentioned that the FasTracks project is gearing down and there is not as much new material to be presented.

Chair Hoy said the agency probably would not talk about starting up new lines.

Director Menten asked when the agency would next look at N Line.

General Manager Genova said that nothing was planned for September and that a presentation could be given in October. He said that RTD has been in talks and back-and-forth legal proceedings with contractor, though he noted that everyone involved wants to find the best way to move forward and discuss a reasonable solution. He said he had reached out to the CEOs of the contractors involved and stated another person at Balfour, one of the companies involved, had reached out to him, which is a good sign. He said the agency did not have anything new in terms of schedule or of RTD delays that would cause the agency to pay more money to the contractors. He said a decision has not been made regarding the entity that will operate and run the N Line but noted that options would be presented to the Board in October.

Director Deadwyler said that General Manager Genova had spoken about the University of Colorado A Line at the previous meeting. She said that his presentation had been positive, but she learned that the agency would have to file for another waiver extension. She asked whether there would ever be an end to the project. She stated that the people in her district are saying that the University of Colorado A line should be shut down and that they cannot get any rest. She added that she had personally heard the piercing sound of the train horns up close.

General Manager Genova replied that he had mentioned to the Board the need for a waiver extension. He said that previous talks with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) had led RTD to believe that the design documents the agency had submitted would be sufficient to satisfy the FRA’s demands. He said that, following that meeting, the agency received a call from the FRA stating that they needed time to review the documents and that they suggested filing for the waiver extension. He noted that the University of Colorado A Line and the B and G Lines are the top priorities.

Director Deadwyler asked whether the delay was driven by paperwork.

General Manager Genova responded that the FRA had approved RTD’s crossing designs but still needed to know how to measure whether the agency met those designs. He said that piece is what needs to be approved. He said that RTD has also been in conversation with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) regarding the next filing process. He said that RTD is in a 30-day waiting period from the date of the previous filing, which will expire after Labor Day. He said that the CPUC would also decide on how the agency is performing and that it is unclear whether the CPUC will make a ruling right away or convene a hearing. He said that RTD wants to have a conversation with the CPUC to attempt to have the G Line approved for crossing testing. He also noted that more than one person at the FRA would need to grant approval.

Director Deadwyler asked whether RTD can give the FRA a deadline.

General Manager Genova said the agency is pushing hard and is in contact with the person who signs the waivers. He said that person is aware and is doing what he can, but he noted there are other forces in the FRA to manage.

Chair Hoy said he felt Director Deadwyler’s pain but noted that the project has progressed quite a bit in the last 60 days.

Director Deadwyler said that the Board knows that but the people in the affected areas do not and no longer believe the agency.

Chair Hoy said that would not believe it until they see it.

Director Menten, referring back to the meeting streamlining proposal, asked whether the GR and Civil Rights (CR) Committees would meet as needed

General Manager Genova said that CR would meet twice each year or as needed and that GR would meet every other month. He said the legislative reports would still be included in the packet.

Ms. McManus noted that legislative reports are included weekly during the legislative session.

Director Menten asked for confirmation that the Ops and Finance meetings would still take place monthly.

Chair Hoy said that those committees would need to meet every month because they are important and their topics cover what the agency does every day.

Ms. McManus noted that, in order to get timely information, Ops and Finance Meetings would need to continue to take place during the second week of the month.

Director Menten said that, as the Board heard in previous Finance meeting, the agency has lean times ahead. She said she wanted to voice her concerns regarding the Board’s direction to staff on where to go and how they should interpret that. She also noted that questions arose when she was signing checks two weeks earlier and asked for confirmation that the agency receives a discount by paying the credit card statement before a certain date, which Ms. McManus confirmed.

Director Menten continued by saying that the agency pays credit expenditures prior to the time the employees fill out their backup documentation. She said that, in reviewing the credit statement, certain things stuck out. Specifically, she mentioned an expenditure for a teambuilding exercise as part of the MAX Program and the purchase of memberships in local chambers of commerce. She said that RTD should not be putting forth any funding that goes toward campaign issues and stated that chambers of commerce are notorious for giving money to ballot issues and candidates. She said that the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce (DMCC) has donated to many campaign issues and causes. She asked how the agency could guarantee that its contributions to chambers were not used for campaigns.

Chair Hoy said that, generally speaking, if a chamber endorses a candidate, position, or ballot issue, that contribution comes from a separate collection of funds from partner entities.

Director Deadwyler said that, when she worked with the A. Phillip Randolph Institute, fundraising was accounted for in a different part of the institute’s ledger and did not go into the general fund.

General Manager Genova said that he would check with DMCC to see how they handle political contributions.

Chair Hoy said that chambers use the same model.

Director Menten asked how the agency would check with the rest of the chambers to which it belongs.

Chair Hoy said that he was a member of the Adams County Political Action Committee, which was loosely affiliated with North Metro Chamber. He said that membership dues did not go toward campaigns.

Director Deadwyler said that the chambers are responsible for their own federal reporting.

General Manager Genova said he would ask DMCC whether their practices are typical among chambers.

Director Menten asked how many Directors attend chamber meetings.

Director Deadwyler said she personally did not attend.

Chair Hoy said that the agency is involved in the Aurora Chamber.

Director Menten said she did not want to drag out the issue but is concerned, especially as the agency tightens its belt. She suggested she would like to see a fiscal note drafted for any direction given to staff that would describe the cost of the item in which the Board has shown interest.

Chair Hoy agreed with Director Menten but said that there are bigger things to go after. He said that fees paid to the Arvada Chamber would not make or break the agency. He said he would like us to focus on things that would really make a difference.

Director Deadwyler said she does not think the agency should be checking with chambers on how they do their accounting.

Chair Hoy said he did not see anything wrong with checking.

Director Menten said that she was uncomfortable signing the check for the teambuilding exercise.

General Manager Genova reiterated that the event is part of MAX week and mentioned that every credit card statement is reviewed by an Assistant General Manager.

Ms. McManus stated that adjustments to statements are made and purchases are questioned on a monthly basis.

General Manager Genova added that audits are continually performed.

Ms. McManus stated that Procurement is involved as well and that they question documentation line by line.

Chair Hoy said that the agency probably spends $50,000 each month auditing the bill.

Director Francone reminded the Executive Committee members that four or five Directors had not yet filled out the General Manager’s performance evaluation survey and would need to do so by the morning of Friday, August 11, 2017. She said that those who did not respond would be getting a phone call.

Chair Hoy asked how Director Francone would know who responded if the survey is anonymous.

Director Francone said that names were optional on the survey but noted that several Directors had included their names

General Manager Genova said that the next meeting of the Mobility Choice Blueprint Initiative would be held on Wednesday, August 23 from 3:00 - 4:30 p.m. at Arrow Electronics. He asked for any attendees to RSVP and stated that the meeting would be followed by a presentation on technology. He said he would send the information to Ms. McManus for distribution.

#### A. Recommendation for Contract Award to HNTB  for FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant Services

It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize award of a five-year contract with an option for a one-year extension with HNTB Corporation in the not-to-exceed amount of $22,368,708 for Systems Engineering consulting work.

#### B. 2017-005 : Approval of Bank Signature Authorization

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).

BACKGROUND

Wells Fargo, as the District’s commercial bank, requires prompt notification of all modifications in the authorized signatories on the District’s various bank accounts.  In order to reflect any changes in District personnel and the election of new Board officers, the Agreement is updated at least annually and periodically as otherwise required.

DISCUSSION

The attached recommended Agreement has been modified from the previously approved Agreement only to reflect the addition of a new checking account which will be used solely for paying invoices related to the winding down of the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA).  Funds deposited in this account will be transferred to RTD from the DUSPA.  The creation and use of this account will enable RTD to clearly account for the remaining DUSPA funds as DUSPA’s remaining obligations are paid over time.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

This recommended Board action poses no financial impact to the District.

ALTERNATIVES:

1.                   It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).

2.                   Modify the attached Agreement.

Do not adopt the attached Agreement.
