Local Needs Also Adding Up:
CML & CCI Presented to the Joint Transportation Committees of the Legislature

∗ CML told the Committees that they had conducted a survey of their
members gauging the state of their local transportation systems.
According to CML, the following were their key findings (excerpted
from the Move Colorado website)
∗ 90% list streets as a budgetary challenge
∗ 53% list street maintenance/improvements #1
∗ 59% report unfunded identified street projects
∗ 24% report unfunded identified bridge projects

∗ CCI backed increasing funding for transportation with an affirmative
statement:

∗ “CCI supports efforts to generate increased transportation revenue to
address state and local transportation infrastructure needs – including a
referred ballot measure to increase transportation revenues – provided that
any new revenues generated are shared among state, county and
municipal governments in the same proportions as current HUTF
payments.” – Colorado Counties, Inc.

∗ Popular with voters
∗ Relied on by local governments as a general revenue source
∗ Temporary source at best

∗ Transportation Lockbox
∗ No access for “off the top” diversions (State Patrol, Ports of Entry, etc.)
∗ No access for legislative diversion to general fund expenditure
∗ .7% sales tax
∗ 10 to 15 year sunset
∗ Distribution between HUTF and Transit at 67% and 33%
∗ Transit distribution to transit agencies and interregional transit projects
∗ HUTF distribution 60% to State, 22% to counties, 18% to
municipalities
∗ Distribution to municipalities optional by region of the state:
∗ Rural by HUTF formulas?
∗ Metro/urban by population?

∗ State and regional project list
∗ Discussion of alternate strategies is ongoing

Possible Distribution Scenario

Date:

Board Meeting Date: August 6, 2013

Subject:

Property Acquisition for the I-225 Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent
domain law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the successful proposer for the construction of the
I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project the right of way necessary for the construction of the project.
Property needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition
process. This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court
proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of all property
identified, subject to any modifications or additions required by the contractor and/or construction
activities.
DISCUSSION
On September 18, 2012 and March 26, 2013 the RTD Board approved the acquisition of properties for
the I-225 project. As detailed final design has progressed by the design-build contractor, additional
acquisitions have been identified. These acquisitions are necessary in those areas for project
construction.
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or Property Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the I-225 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed
with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2013
I-225 SEGMENT 2 LIGHT RAIL PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list the
property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation to
acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate condemnation
proceedings to acquire the additional identified Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the authority to
amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it deems necessary in the
best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the power of
eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project, although financially compensated according to the law, makes a significant personal
sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that there is
a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in furtherance of a
public purpose, and that the additional acquisitions are for the benefit of the public health, welfare and
safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as the Board’s
delegatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
The Board directs that the RTD delegatees should negotiate in good faith for the acquisition of
the property and if the delegatee is unable to acquire any property through good faith negotiations, then
the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.

Packet Pg. 33

2.C.1

The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property owners,
to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of owners to the
maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties as soon
as permitted by law.
Made and adopted this ___ day of _________________, 2013.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: August 1, 2013

From:

Richard Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

July 31, 2013

Board Meeting Date: August 6, 2013

Subject:

Sublease Agreement (RTD Park and Ride
Facilities)
by
and
between
Regional
Transportation
District
and
Stadium
Management Company, LLC

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Sublease Agreement for parking with the Stadium Management Company (SMC) on certain real
property, commonly known as Sports Authority Field at Mile High and certain parking lots proximate to
the Stadium all located in the City and County of Denver, State of Colorado. Said Subleased Premises
will be leased for the purpose of operating parking facilities for use by commuters. Funding for this
lease in 2013 is included in the 2013 Amended Budget for FasTracks operations, and future year
funding will be included in future year FasTracks operating budgets.
BACKGROUND
The West Corridor Final Environmental Impact Statement, October, provides for RTD to lease parking
spaces from the stadium for RTD parking. The Full Funding Grant Agreement by and between the
Regional Transportation District and the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Transit
Administration acknowledges this commitment.
DISCUSSION
The lease of approximately 1,100 parking spaces, known as Lot M, will be for a term of thirty (30)
years. There are provisions in the lease for early termination of the lease in whole or in part in the 3rd
Sublease Year (2016), the tenth Sublease Year (2023) and the 15th Sublease Year (2028). The lease
can be extended twice, each for an additional fifteen (15) year period.
The lease will provide that RTD may retain any and all revenues generated from the parking of vehicles
within the Subleased Premises on all dates during the term with the exception of SMC Event Days. The
SMC shall have the exclusive right to use the Subleased Premises in connection with any event to be
held at the Stadium for fifteen (15) days, guaranteed, and may designate another fifteen (15) days
during each calendar year. SMC shall provide RTD with a written schedule of the dates which SMC
designates as the SMC Use Dates as soon as practicable after SMC’s receipt of each National Football
League schedule and will provide at least thirty (30) days prior to any of the other optional fifteen (15)
days. RTD will notice patrons of the dates parking is unavailable at this location.
RTD will be obligated to provide any and all services necessary for RTD’s operation of the Subleased
Premises during the term.
The lease will also contain provisions for possible redevelopment of the site by SMC. RTD will make
certain improvements (primarily re-paving) on the lot consistent with standards at other RTD parking
facilities and as specified by the lease.

Packet Pg. 40

2.C.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The rent for the first Sublease Year shall be $677,417.00. Rent shall be subject to CPI adjustment
effective the second year. This is approximately $600 per space per year, which is significantly less
than the cost of constructing new parking. The annual rent is a result of negotiation based on the RTD
appraisal prepared by Peter D. Bowes, MAI, Bowes and Company and an appraisal prepared by David B.
Clayton, ASA, JD, Clayton and Company, Inc. for the law firm Robinson Waters & O’Dorisio, P.C., legal
counsel for the Stadium Management Company.
Funding for this lease in 2013 is included in the 2013 Amended Budget for FasTracks operations, and
future year funding will be included in future year FasTracks operating budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute
all documents necessary to enter into a Sublease Agreement for parking with the Stadium
Management Company (SMC) on certain real property, commonly known as Sports Authority Field at
Mile High and certain parking lots proximate to the Stadium all located in the City and County of
Denver, State of Colorado. Said Subleased Premises will be leased for the purpose of operating
parking facilities for use by commuters. Funding for this lease in 2013 is included in the 2013
Amended Budget for FasTracks operations, and future year funding will be included in future year
FasTracks operating budgets
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to enter into a Sublease Agreement for parking with the Stadium Management Company
(SMC) on certain real property, commonly known as Sports Authority Field at Mile High and certain
parking lots proximate to the Stadium all located in the City and County of Denver, State of
Colorado.

Board Meeting Date: August 6, 2013

Subject:

Donation of Vintage Rail

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to donate vintage rail, tie plates and wooden ties for
restoration purposes to Como Depot.
BACKGROUND
The vintage rail is located in a land locked area between Evans and East Asbury Avenue. The adjacent
properties include high density housing, storage units and a paint distribution store. The existing rail is a
mix of narrow gauge 80-90 pound connected to wooden ties with plates and steel spikes. RTD has
never or will ever use this weight of rail or our existing light rail service. With no long term plan for
restoration or use, a constrained budget, the opportunity for removal and re-use was considered in the
fall of 2012.
In summer of 2012, RTD was contacted by the Como Depot stating their desire to remove the rail,
wooden ties and plates, restore and reuse them in a historical round house located in Como, Colorado.
The Como Depot, a non-profit historic organization, is in process of refurbishing the historic roundhouse
and hotel which dates back to 1879. Como Depot has partnered with several entities which include
CDOT, State Historical Fund, Colorado Preservation, Denver South Park and Pacific Historical Society,
Park County and South Park National Heritage Area.
Pursuant to receiving this letter, RTD staff recommended to the Board of Directors that the vintage rail,
tie plates and wooden ties be donated to Como Depot. RTD staff developed an advertisement method,
described below under Discussion, and compiled a historical report which is attached.
DISCUSSION
The contracting method for transfer of the vintage rail and components was a Request for Expression of
Interest and Information (REFII). REFII No. 13JB008 was issued on 05/25/2013 and copies of the REFII
were provided to 15 prospective vendors in addition to being advertised with the Denver News Agency.
The vendor list was:
Como Depot
SRC Industries, Inc.
Railroad Specialties
United Railroad Service Co.
North American Rail Products
Pikes Peak Historical
Littleton Museum
Colorado History
Lakewood Historical Society
Colorado Historical Foundation
Arvada Historical Society

Advertisement was closed on 06/12/2013 with two proposals received, one from Como Depot and SRC
Industries, Inc.
On 06/24/2013 the RTD project team met and discussed the following:
•
•
•
•

Como Depot more than qualifies them for the project of the Buchtel Vintage Rail, Tie Plate and
Wooden Tie Removal.
Como Depot is willing to accept all aspects listed in the REFII 13HJB008 for the removal of the
vintage rail.
Como Depot funding will rely on donations and volunteers for all aspects of the REFII.
Como Depot partners include State Historical Fund, CDOT, Colorado Preservation, Denver South
Park and Pacific Historical Society, Park County, South Park National Heritage Area, with others
contributing their time and funds for the Depot restoration.

The contract for ownership transfer would be zero dollars, this proposal, if accepted would result in no
expenses for RTD. RTD will not receive any funds in return for these vintage rails, tie plates and
wooden ties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No impact to RTD’s current or future budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to donate vintage rail,
tie plates and wooden ties for restoration purposes to Como Depot.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to donate vintage rails, tie plates and wooden ties to Como Depot. Instead, leave the property as is
and do not disturb the vintage rails, tie plates and wooden ties. This alternative is not recommended
as RTD has no long-term plan or budget for restoration or reuse of these items.

RTD Real Property White Paper

Introduction
The intent of this white paper is to describe the real property management and disposition process at
RTD including how real property management interfaces with the TOD function at RTD. This white
paper outlines all existing RTD, state and federal regulations that govern RTD’s acquisition and
disposition of real property and identifies other policy (including TOD) and operational considerations
that need to be taken into account in this process. Also, this paper summarizes how other similar public
agencies approach real property management. Finally, this paper identifies some steps RTD may
consider to more proactively manage its real property assets.

Regulations Governing RTD Real Property
There are several state, federal and RTD laws, regulations and policies which govern the acquisitions and
disposition of properties. RTD must maintain compliance with these requirements.
RTD’s legal authority to acquire property is established in Colorado Revised Statutes C.R.S. 32-9-101 et
seq. “Regional Transportation Act” as amended. This legislation empowers the Board to acquire,
manage, and dispose of property in furtherance of the authorization of planning, building, operating and
maintaining a mass transportation system. This authority includes the power to condemn property for
public use. It is important to note that the authority granted to RTD by the state specifically defines
that RTD can only acquire property for the purposes of mass transit. Different regulations apply to the
disposition of property acquired by RTD depending on the funding source. The disposition of properties
acquired with local funding only are subject to the legal authority above and the Regional
Transportation District Resolution No. 10 Series of 1984 (Resolution Regarding Joint Development and
Disposition of Property Rights) attached as Exhibit A. Disposition of property requires RTD Board
approval.
The acquisition and disposition of property acquired by RTD for federally assisted programs and projects
are subject to acquisition and relocation policies and provisions contained in the government-wide rule
published in the Federal Register on January 4, 2005. The rules are reprinted each year in the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49, Part 24. All Federal, State, local government agencies, and others
receiving Federal financial assistance for public programs and projects that require the acquisition of
real property must comply with the policies and provisions set forth in the Uniform Act and the
regulation. The acquisition itself does not need to be federally funded for the rules to apply. If Federal
funds are used in any phase of the program or project, the rules of the Uniform Act apply.

April 3, 2013

In addition to the Uniform Act, the Federal Transit Administration requires Grantees to be familiar with
other regulations that specifically address the disposition of property, especially U.S. Department of
Transportation, Federal Transit Administration Circular FTA C 5010.1D Grant Management Requirements
dated November 1, 2008, Rev 1, August 27, 2012. The Circular establishes procedures to be followed by
grantees for the disposition of properties, including (1.) selling property (competitively to the extent
practicable) and reimbursing FTA its share of the fair market value, and (2) selling real property and
using the proceeds to reduce the cost of the grant if it is still open or of other FTA funded capital
projects.
A list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired without federal funding assistance is
attached as Exhibit B and a list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired as part of a
federally funded project is attached as Exhibit C.
As a general rule, property acquired for a construction project is not considered for disposition until
after the construction contract is complete. RTD construction contracts generally make property
acquired for the project available to the construction contractor for construction installation, access to
the site or storage.

Other Policy and Operational Considerations for RTD Real Property Management
There are multiple additional policy and operational considerations that need to be evaluated in the
context of the management, acquisition and disposition of RTD real property. These considerations
should be evaluated in the context of overriding rules and regulations on real property discussed in the
previous section.
Key considerations beyond the existing regulations that govern real property management include:


Financial – management decisions including the acquisition, disposition or transfer of some
other form of property rights are influenced by the general financial conditions of the district
and the financial status of individual capital improvement projects. Examples of this kind of
influence include:
o RTD’s Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) – the RTD Board approved the potential to sell
selected excess properties for the purpose of adding revenues to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA). This consideration requires RTD staff to look proactively at
selling selected parcels no longer needed for transit purposes to raise revenues to pay
for FasTracks related improvements.
o Engineering decisions on capital improvement projects – financial considerations are
taken into account in acquisition of property for RTD facilities. Budget limitations on
projects often require creative thinking and design to minimize or avoid acquiring
property for RTD rail and bus facilities. RTD staff work very hard to take only property
that is absolutely required for construction and operation of RTD facilities.

Attachment: Real Property White PaperFINALv3 (1646 : Real Property and TOD White Paper Update)

3.C.1.b

o

o

Fair Market Value – RTD establishes the value of a property for disposal through a fair
market appraisal. An offer significantly below the appraised fair market value would not
be approved.
Certificates of Participation (COPs) – COPs are used frequently by RTD to leverage
existing RTD assets, including property, for the purposes of financing other RTD
obligations such as capital improvements. The utilization of COPs on RTD real property
must be considered since the disposition of property which is encumbered by a COP will
require that the COP obligation be paid off or transferred to another RTD asset.



Current and Future Operational Needs – RTD’s current and future operational needs are always
evaluated in RTD’s property management process. There are some parcels in RTD’s property
inventory that are underutilized and/or are no longer required for its original intended purpose.
In these situations, it is incumbent on RTD staff to evaluate not only the current utilization of the
property, but the potential for future RTD use. This is extremely important because disposing of
property should only be done in cases where there is no foreseeable transit need for the
property. RTD does not want to be in the situation where it sells an underutilized property and
then determines two or three years later that it did need the property after all.



Transit Oriented Development Opportunities – the opportunity for TOD is an additional
consideration in the acquisition and disposition of property. First and foremost, RTD can only
purchase property for mass transit and cannot purchase property for development. That being
said, RTD does want to encourage the development of transit oriented communities around its
stations and does proactively look for partnership opportunities with local jurisdictions and
private developers to implement TOD at stations. Forming partnerships with others may allow
RTD to avoid acquiring property for RTD’s exclusive use. Examples of this type of partnership
include the Olde Town Arvada station and the Westminster station where the local jurisdictions
acquired property to promote the integration of RTD bus and parking facilities into a larger plan
for transit oriented development.
Additional consideration may be given to TOD in the land disposition process. When certain
conditions are present including local jurisdiction support and commitment for TOD
implementation (the presence of an adopted station area plan, TOD supportive zoning and
commitment of funding for public infrastructure) and private developer commitment and
resources (ownership of land and expenditure of resources on design and entitlements) RTD
may consider reinvesting land proceeds for the purposes of enhancing the station environment
through the implementation of TOD. Examples of this include the Boulder Junction bus transfer
facility and the Alameda TOD Pilot Project where the RTD Board chose to reinvest land sale
proceeds back into the transit facilities that are being built or being reconfigured associated
with the implementation of TOD.

3.C.1.b

A review of procedures of other public agencies, including General Services Administration (GSA),
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA),
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and
various municipalities within the RTD district was done. All emphasize obtaining the fair market value,
as determined by appraisal of the property to be disposed of and most dispose of surplus property via a
competitive sale to the public generally through a sealed bid or auction. No marketing efforts are a part
of the disposition procedures.

Potential Modifications to RTD’s Real Property Management Approach
As RTD moves forward with the build out of FasTracks and the ongoing operation of its existing bus and
light rail system, modifications to RTD’s Real Property management could be considered. The
modifications would focus on being proactive where appropriate, but understanding that RTD is only in
the business of buying and selling real estate for constructing and operating a mass transit system.
RTD staff proposes the following steps in an effort to more proactively management its real property
assets:
1. Review and Refine Inventory of Surplus and Underutilized Property. Inventories of surplus and
underutilized real properties are attached. RTD staff will evaluate all properties contained in
either inventory, federally funded and/or locally funded and will focus on larger, possibly more
marketable parcels. Small/sliver parcels and other nonmarketable parcels will not be included
in the revised inventory.
2. Conduct an Assessment of Excess and Underutilized Real Property. RTD staff will form a
multidisciplinary committee to assess the potential disposition of parcels within the inventory of
surplus and underutilized parcels. In evaluating the inventory of parcels, RTD will consider all
the factors discussed in this white paper including regulations governing RTD property
disposition and other policy and operational considerations. Following the completion of this
evaluation, RTD staff will consult with select local subject matter experts to get their
perspectives on RTD’s real property inventory in the context of the factors governing RTD’s real
property disposition. RTD staff will then inform the Board of its assessment of the inventory of
parcels. If staff were to move forward with any property disposition, the RTD Board would have
to approve the final negotiated business terms unless the Board had previously delegated that
authority to the General Manager.
3. Develop a Marketing Plan for Select Surplus and Underutilized Property. RTD staff will also
determine if there is a need to market the surplus or underutilized property. Marketing efforts
could include the development of a Request for Proposals (RFP), the installation of for sale signs
on the property to be disposed of, communication with local commercial, industrial and/or
residential property brokers who sell property in the vicinity, or other efforts to be determined.
RTD staff does not feel it would be advantageous to hire a real estate broker to market

Packet Pg. 85

Attachment: Real Property White PaperFINALv3 (1646 : Real Property and TOD White Paper Update)

Peer Agency Approaches to Real Property Management

individual properties. Hiring a broker would reduce the amount of funds that RTD could receive
on the property because of the need to pay a commission to the broker. It would also require a
competitive solicitation each time a need for representation was identified, adding additional
time and cost to any disposition. In addition, none of the peer public agencies we surveyed
utilized a separate, private real estate broker in the disposition of real property.
4. Ongoing Process to Evaluate TOD Opportunities – RTD TOD staff will continue to proactively
pursue TOD opportunities where appropriate. As identified earlier, RTD will seek out
opportunities for partnerships with local jurisdictions and/or private developers where RTD can
leverage other resources to enhance our bus and rail stations and integrate transit more
seamlessly with development.
Other factors including market viability for TOD and
opportunities to encourage affordable housing as identified by RTD Board policy will also be
considered in the pursuit of TOD. When necessary, RTD staff will engage outside real estate
experts, on-call consultants and others to help evaluate TOD opportunities and negotiate with
private developers (RTD staff has utilized this approach for multiple projects including the DUS
Historic Building, the Alameda TOD Pilot and the Arvada TOD Pilot). RTD staff may engage
additional, outside experts on TOD under the following conditions:





The outside party has agreed to not compete or bid for the TOD opportunity for which
they are being consulted
Each individual TOD opportunity should be evaluated independently on a case by case
basis to determine the type of outside expertise needed since every project has unique
characteristics
Outside experts advising RTD should have a local understanding of the Denver real
estate market

Summary
In conclusion, the sale of surplus property can provide needed revenue to RTD and relieve the District of
the cost to maintain these properties. RTD will take additional steps to inventory, access and market
surplus properties. However, as described in this paper, the disposition of property is a complex
endeavor that must take into account legal, financial, contractual, and future operational requirements
while also considering transit oriented development opportunities where applicable. As we continue to
improve our processes in this area, we will schedule a study session to gather input from the RTD Board
on this very important item.
