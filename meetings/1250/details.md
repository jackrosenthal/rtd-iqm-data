Michael commented that he was honored to be here.  We have always had a good transit system but now he believes we have a great system. He appreciates his time in the TIC Center and petitioned for funding for more resources/staff.  As RTD grows and move people, we expect more and more calling and we need more people to handle the volume. He is thankful for his experience and to be able to serve at RTD.

Austin Jenkins, AGM of Rail Operations, introduced his two retirees, John Hatton and Bobbie L. McGinnis.  He asked Phil Eberl, Manager to present John Hatton.  Phil indicated that John had begun his career in the Platte Division and moved to LRT around 1993.  John has always been their ace in the hole. He has implemented numerous retrofits and streamlined processed as an electro-mechanic.

Austin Jenkins introduced Bobbie L. McGinnis who was a MAX participant.  Prior to working at RTD, Bobbie worked at UPS so she is very familiar with moving people and process around. Bobbie started as a bus driver and in 2004 became a LRT controller.  Bobbie could be seen all over the place helping out (i.e. roadeo, COMTO, etc.).  She has three children, one of whom was there.

Bobbie thanked everyone for her experiences at RTD. She related it to be a growing experience.  She has now accepted a position with an architectural firm where she can apply some of her previous experience as well as continue in her learning.  She stated that she will still be around.

Bruce Abel, AGM for bus operations, asked Dean Shaklee to join him in the introduction of Lloyd Joe, certified mechanic with 36 years of service.  Dean stated that Lloyd spent much if his time in the bus maintenance department.  He was the first person staffed at East metro when it opened up.  He has worked primarily on articulated buses.  Lloyd has 2 boys and 3 daughters and a host of grandchildren.  He plans to travel around in his motor home.

Lloyd commented that he did not know how he made 36 years.

Mike Gil, Deputy AGM for Bus Operations, introduced David Newcomb, bus operator with 18 years of service. Mile stated that David had been married for 34 years and his wife and daughter were in the audience.  Dave plans to fish, ski, and read.  Dave has always helped out with the Broncos lot and plans to do so.

## V. Public Participation

- Peter Richard, Boulder Co, indicated that he has always been a transit advocate and served as Eco pass coordinator for 15 years.  He had observed that we have a visibility problem on the back end of our bus which creates a traffic hazard especially around the Broadway-University area.  He recommended RTD put a color scheme on the back of buses similar to fire units.  He provided the Board members with a picture of what he was recommending.  He also suggested they do a pilot project on this.

Chair Anderson stated the idea sounded interesting and asked staff to investigate.

- Nghia Nguyen, RMR, stated that he was back again with lots of work to be done.  He acknowledged some progress had been made but stated RMR should not be allowed to regress back to misclassification of wages or in compliance to DBE/SBE requirements.  He indicated they do plan to file a formal DBE/SBE compliant with the City of Denver and RTD.

- Sheila Lieder, Denver, stated she represented the Denver area Labor Federation which represents about 50K people.  They also represent thousands of rail workers.  They are very concerned with the federal wage violation as well as the issues with DBE.  She hopes that RTD will do better and help to enforce the laws affecting safety issues and DBE.  She hopes we will have responsible construction for North Metro.  She is looking forward to a better year for ironworkers.

- Ricky Martinez, RMR reiterated some of his previous claims and asked that RTD not have RMR on our job sites.  They are bad news and one of the worse companies that he has ever worked for.

- Rima Sinclair spoke about the ads running on buses.  She feels we need to differentiate between free speech and hate messages which are racism.  She feels the ads are in violation of free speech and borders on hate.  She spoke about how ADL has denounced these ads; this is a fringe extremist group. She asked RTD to (1.) Uphold free speech but do not support hate speech: targeting an ethnic group is hate speech. (2). Do what Miami Dade Transit did: pull down the ads as promoting bigotry and fueling discrimination. (3). San Francisco: similar ads came up, and board distanced themselves and dedicated funds to go to study discrimination.
