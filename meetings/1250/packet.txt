Federal Update – Patton Boggs Washington, DC Team
Committee Chair Daly introduced the Patton Boggs Team: Kevin O’Neill, Anne
Miano, Jared Fleisher and Denver 2013 Man of the Year, Mike Dino. Kevin
O’Neill shared that the Patton Boggs team prepared a presentation which is
available in the December 3, 2013 Government Relations Board Packet. Mr.
O’Neill noted the team had a great experience having an extended in-depth tour
of the rail lines under construction and the fantastic continued transformation
at Denver Union Station (DUS) earlier in the day. Kevin O’Neill shared it was a
unique and exciting opportunity to see how Patton Boggs efforts have been
helpful to RTD over past few years. Mr. O’Neill stated the team would move
quickly through their slides giving a sense of what is going on in Washington
and then focus on the Board’s questions.
Mr. O’Neill informed the Board that Patton Boggs takes great privilege in
working with one of the most outstanding General Managers in the country;
RTD is a place that had an outstanding General Manager succeeded by an
outstanding General Manager, which makes a huge difference in terms of
achieving goals and successes. Kevin O’Neill also advised the Board that the
RTD Board is the most engaged Board that the Patton Boggs team has worked
with in the transportation arena; without a doubt, the staff is the best in the
business. Mr. O’Neill commented that he thought even the people at the
Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) would agree.
Mr. O’Neill reported that RTD’s track record for success speaks for itself and

Packet Pg. 7

Directors Hoy and Rivera-Malpiede were absent.

6.A

Mr. O’Neill commented that DOT is obviously undergoing an interesting
transformation as they move from having a former House Republican member
who sat on the Committees of Jurisdiction, to Anthony Foxx as Director of
Transportation. Anthony Foxx is a former Mayor of the City of Charlotte, a
city in many respects that has a transportation record similar to Denver’s.
Charlotte is a rapidly growing region that has endeavored to have their
infrastructure keep pace and evolve with their demands and who has also had
some success at the federal level. Mr. O’Neill shared that Anthony Foxx
thoroughly understands what is happening with mass transportation in the
Denver Region. Patton Boggs hopes to have Mr. Foxx in Denver at some
future ribbon-cutting event. Last but not least, Kevin O’Neill noted that the
ability to speak with a unified regional voice is very important in Washington.
Mr. O’Neill then turned the floor over to his colleagues, Anne Miano and Jared
Fleisher, to talk briefly about the federal agenda and where things currently
stand.
Anne Miano noted that RTD’s critical issue to be faced this year is funding.
Ms. Miano noted that RTD has an FTA New Starts budget that requires over
$2 billion dollars to fully fund all the projects previously committed. However,
without a budget deal to fix the current sequester, FTA will be about $240
million dollars short on their commitments for FFGAs. Anne Miano shared that
the FTA is considering different ways to fix the shortfall; they have pots of
unallocated money and different pools of recovered funding, as well as other
creative means that the FTA can use to try to restore some of those funds.
Ms. Miano shared that some methods of refurbishing the funds may require
congressional approval and that even with all that maneuvering on the part of
the FTA, they will still be about $100 million dollars short in terms of the
overall FFGA funding.
Jared Fleisher commented that negotiations are underway and that the Patton
Boggs team is optimistic regarding some of the unobligated funds and is
looking to get more dollars into the RTD-Denver program than was received
last year.
Jared Fleisher spoke regarding MAP-21 Reauthorization, noting the Highway
Trust Fund is the real issue, which is funded by gas taxes. Federal gas taxes
have not increased since 1993; they are a fixed per-gallon gas tax that has not
increased with inflation. It does not increase with construction costs. Because
Packet Pg. 8

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 3, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

that entities do not win as many competitive grant opportunities, or get as
many things into the New Starts pipeline; nor do you get major tax initiatives
passed without outstanding staff and the ability to convince people of the
merits of these transportation projects. RTD continue to enjoy an outstanding
relationship with the congressional delegation and the major players at the US
DOT.

we now have more fuel efficient cars and because people are now driving less,
there is a major structural deficit in the Highway Trust fund to the tune of $15
billion a year. If the FTA is unable to come up with new revenues, the
Highway Trust Fund will take a $15 billion dollar hit next year. Mr. Fleisher
noted that the Highway Trust Fund has been in this position since 2008. There
has been an evidenced commitment in Congress to find a way to not make
cuts to the Highway Trust Fund program. Infrastructure is too important to
everyone in the district and too important to the economy. The question now
is what they do this time around. The optimistic take is that good bipartisan
cooperation exists between Chairwoman Boxer and Bill Schuster – they both
want to solve this problem. Congress has shown that infrastructure is one
area where they can get together and solve problems. The reality is this is a
hard problem to solve.
Anne Miano noted that there have been a number of options being considered
for raising revenues for MAP-21 and the scenario will likely be the same on
MAP-22. One option is a Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) tax; there are concerns
from some people who do not like the word VMT tax and others who do not
like any word or phrase that include the word tax. Ms. Miano shared that
there are implementation problems and technological issues. Raising monies
from new energy exploration could be part of a deal. Increasing or indexing
the gasoline tax, switching to a sales tax on gasoline, and raising nontransportation revenue are all considerations. These considerations are all very
complicated; they each have their different sponsors as well as those who are
opposed. Anne Miano commented that it is very unlikely people will come
together to create a good solution by next fall when they have to reauthorize
MAP-21 and she feels that MAP-22 will be very similar. There will likely be
some short-term patch, some pot of funds dedicated to keep the program
moving, and then look toward the future when hopefully the economy will look
better, people will be getting along with each other better in Congress, and we
can sit down as reasonable folks and look to create a transportation program
that makes sense for the country.
Kevin O’Neill stated that in the next year, Patton Boggs will work a lot on
reauthorization issues. While the betting would be we are going to have a
status quo short-term patch, we have to advocate as if there is going to be a
new six year bill. While MAP-21 is only 14 months into its existence, there are
already some obvious winners and losers; some places where we come out
ahead, other places where we come out behind, so there are some things we
have to worry about. Mr. O’Neill shared that Patton Boggs will be spending
time educating the Delegation and the authorizing committee, the people in the
Secretary’s Office, about how things should work in the future. Kevin O’Neill
expounded that RTD staff should reasonably expect to have a very visible role
in the reauthorization debate because RTD has been a shining example of how
effective money can be used to build new infrastructure that actually meets its
Packet Pg. 9

6.A

promises and in many cases exceeds the expectations.

Kevin O’Neill noted that Patton Boggs have a couple of main objectives for
2014. They will focus on the New Starts funding agenda because that is the
biggest pot of gold out there for this reauthorization period, given the
FasTracks agenda. The Patton Boggs team will be looking at MAP-21
reauthorization and will spend some time with RTD staff in the next 60-90
days developing a wish list of things that worked, things that need to be
tweaked, and things that need to be cast aside. This will be the list of things
that staff will be working on with Delegation members when staff is in
Washington.
The Patton Boggs team will be updating the Delegation on the status of RTD’s
system, so that staff has an opportunity to delve into the big picture with
members of the Delegation and some of the other offices and agencies that we
work with, and also to get down at the granular level. The Patton Boggs team
is planning on meeting with the Congressional Delegation Transit Community
Leaders and also plan to visit with the DOT as well.
In May 2014, Patton Boggs hope to have in place with RTD Staff and US DOT
leaders, the chance to have some DOT folks in Denver for the ribbon cutting at
the DUS station, and to also have an event the day before that focuses on
some of the policy successes that are driving RTD.
Committee Chair Daly opened the floor for questions.
Director Lubow commented that she is interested in the Northwest Line which
is a line that has not yet been funded and will continue to have trouble getting
federal funding and grant money. Director Lubow wondered if the Patton
Boggs team has thought about ways through the reauthorization process or
through re-thinking New Starts that perhaps could help a line like the
Northwest line get federal funding.
Kevin O’Neill responded that when staff looks back, they’ll be able to be very
happy historically that FasTracks happened when it did. Federal spending has
reached a tipping point where the appetite to grow the New Starts projects
Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 3, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Kevin O’Neill stated that regarding plans for 2014, Patton Boggs will continue
to work with everyone on the Delegation to provide them with briefings. When
the Patton Boggs team was out on their tour earlier today in Denver, they were
working with Sheri and with some great folks on the PR staff to walk through
things like the status of construction, planned operations to figure out what
material needed to be passed along to Hill staff so they can understand the
significant progress being made. The more the Delegation understands how
progress is being made, the easier it is for them to advocate on RTD’s behalf.

6.A

Director Lubow commented that Mr. O’Neill’s answer didn’t really help the
Northwest Line. Mr. O’Neill stated that he wasn’t sure that there was an
answer that would satisfy Director Lubow’s question. He noted that Patton
Boggs will obviously do their best to make sure that the criteria fit all the future
plans of FasTracks and other objectives of RTD. Kevin O’Neill shared that
Patton Boggs sees policy choices being made that mean fewer projects qualify
for federal aid in the future in the New Starts program than qualify today.
Director Deadwyler commented that on one of the slides on keeping federal
Stakeholders informed and on board, they had included the Southeast corridor
extension. Director Deadwyler was not aware that staff had moved in the
direction of that being the choice based on extensions previously discussed.
Kevin O’Neill responded that paperwork has been filed with the FTA to start
the process of moving that project forward, which is why that information was
included in the slide.
General Manager Washington commented that last year or a year and a half
ago, staff came to the Board and the Board approved staff applying for a New
Starts grant for the Southeast corridor, primarily because the Southeast
corridor fits the existing New Starts criteria. Currently, we are in the final
stage of the project development phase for the Southeast. The next phase
would be final engineering. The Southeast corridor is the only project right
now that is in the application phase of the extension.
Director Deadwyler wondered if the Southeast corridor was also in the running
for the Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon project. General Manager Washington
responded that the North Metro corridor is not a federal corridor; it is not in the
New Starts program, and the project is not federalized.
Director Bagley noted that Patton Boggs presentation spoke about the ability to
speak as one voice in DC. Director Bagley stated he could not stress enough
that understanding the “speak as one voice” fact is critical. Everything RTD
does as a Board and a District has to be coordinated and must be seen as
speaking with one voice.
Director Bagley also mentioned Patton Boggs talking about their 2014 strategy
plan. He commented that Patton Boggs believes the Eagle P3 project and
RTD’s work with the private sector is a key project to highlight. Director
Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 3, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

does not exist; yet, demand for projects remains extraordinary high. In the last
two bills, there has been a concentrated effort to ratchet the pipeline down in a
way that makes it harder to enter and harder to stay in so that projects that
were not likely to get funded today are less likely to get funded in the future.
RTD, as well as other agencies, will have to assess which of their current
projects are going to be most likely to procure federal funding.

6.A

Bagley believes the other project to think about is the work RTD has done with
the Denver Union Station project in working both with FRA and FTA as well as
the funding through TIFIA and RRIF loans. He stated the success RTD has had
had with those two silos where we’ve somewhat integrated and worked with
both of those together. That’s another one that can be utilized in future
strategies, not only as far as what we have done, but other jurisdictions being
able to replicate those sorts of things.

Director Sisk thanked the Patton Boggs team for attending the meeting and
stated that he personally really appreciates the ongoing relationship between
RTD and Patton Boggs. Director Sisk noted that his challenge to all of Patton
Boggs is to ensure that RTD has a robust BRT in the US36 corridor. He hopes
there will be a robust schedule in March, 2014, in terms of visits while the
Board is in Washington. Director Sisk would like the Board to be more active
than they were for the visit in 2013.
Director Sisk wondered if we are working with Senator Bennett and Senator
Udall. The Senators had a meeting in Greeley earlier this week regarding quiet
zones. Direct Sisk stated that he is hopeful RTD will follow up working with
the Senators in a very positive way to make sure quite zones are addressed
and addressed very soon. Director Sisk looks forward to RTD and staff
continuing to be the leaders that we are and that it’s time to seize on this
opportunity.
Kevin O’Neill asked Director Daly if he could gather input from the Board to
provide back to the Patton Boggs team regarding collective wisdom and how
the Board would like things to operate. The Patton Boggs team would greatly
benefit from that information. It would be most helpful for Patton Boggs to
have this information in early January.
Committee Chair Daly agreed gathering that type of information for Patton
Boggs was a great idea. Noting no other speakers in the queue, Committee
Chair Daly thanked the Patton Boggs team for their visit and wished them a
good flight home.

Local Update – CRL Associates – Maria Garcia Berry
Maria Garcia Berry greeted the Board and shared that she was presenting this
evening on behalf of Roger Sherman. CRL’s update is to keep RTD and staff
apprised on a statewide attempt to go to Ballot on a transportation issue.
Maria Garcia Berry noted that as RTD staff is aware, there is a group called
MPACT64, which is a coalition of different governmental entities throughout
the state. The private sector also has been having conversation about whether
Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 3, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Daly noted for the record that Director Menten has joined the
meeting.

6.A

to go to the ballot at some point for more transportation dollars, along with the
Metro Mayors Caucus and the metro area Commissioners.

To refresh RTD staff’s memory, Ms. Garcia Berry shared that the issue being
polled is about a three-quarters of a of 1% sales tax increase. One third of the
revenues from this increase would come straight off the top to go to transit
statewide and would be determined by population only. The balance of the
two thirds revenue would be divided in respect to the HUTF formula currently
in statute, which is 60% would go directly to CDOT and 40% to the locals, of
which that 40% is divided into 22% going to the counties and 18% going to
the cities. There continues to be ongoing dialog going on from some of the
groups. Some people want to change the formula on the local side, not the
state or transit side.
Maria Garcia Berry commented that the good news here is that if in fact this
initiative ever goes forward, there are two pretty dramatic public policy moves
that are being contemplated. One is that the public would no longer depend on
the gas tax for transportation funding and the second one is that transit would
be recognized statewide with one third of the money being devoted to transit
statewide. These issues are all being tested in next few weeks; we’ll get some
poll results back shortly. CRL have been having conversations with General
Manager Washington regarding how this can all play out. She said they are
testing some projects statewide and are also trying to oversample in the metro
area. All of this will be unfolding in the near term and will become public right
before Christmas. There are many players involved, including the Governor
and other elected officials, as to whether any of this initiative moves forward.
Maria Garcia Berry then asked if there were any questions.
Director Menten inquired about the two December dates that were important;
Maria Garcia Berry replied that on December 17 the MPACT64 Group will
meet, which is the broad coalition of statewide entities that have been working
together, and then on December 18 the Metro Mayor’s Caucus will meet to
digest data.
Director Menten wondered about polling. Maria Garcia Berry stated that there
was a private coalition called the Colorado Transportation Coalition, about a
year ago convened a poll that did the first major transportation poll statewide
since prior to TREX to really understood where voters stood with regard to gas
Packet Pg. 13

Maria Garcia Berry reported that there are two pretty significant dates coming
up this month, December 17 and December 18 where hopefully, as soon the
first draft of the poll has been reviewed, CRL will have some data to share with
the coalition regarding whether it makes sense to move forward. Obviously
there will need to be a great deal of analyses, given the aftermath of
Amendment 66.

State Update – Jenifer Brandeberry
Jenifer Brandeberry of Brandeberry-McKenna passed out a brief memo that
summarizes the interim activities Brandeberry-McKenna has been working on in
RTD’s behalf. The thicker memo is a little bit dated, but she felt that as folks
that are engaged in transportation issues, RTD staff and Board might
appreciate the report that CDOT recently provided to the flood disaster
committee that has been meeting since September. That committee has one
more meeting which is scheduled for December 30th. Again, this report is a
little dated but does provide some general background of what a lot of the
legislation this upcoming session might be focusing in terms of both statutory
and potentially constitutional changes that might come up and that are being
recommended by this committee that may have tangential implications to
transportation infrastructure funding in general.
Jenifer Brandeberry noted that the other interim committee that is most
important to RTD is the Transportation Legislative Review Committee who
Brandeberry and Associates presented to this past summer. This committee
has wrapped up their work; and the Flood Disaster committee will finish at the
end of December.
Jenifer Brandeberry commented that other activities that Brandeberry and
Associates has worked on for RTD include 3 legislative tours conducted at
DUS. Ms. Brandeberry shared that the tours were very well received and it’s
been amazing to actually physically get Legislators in that space to have them
start to see what RTD staff already knows, how getting DUS and FasTracks
working together are really going to transform the Denver metropolitan area.
Legislators are actually starting to see physical, real things: the line out to the
airport, the West line that opened early last April, and now DUS. BrandeberryMcKenna had the chairs of the transportation committees come to that, some
of the staff members at TLRC and some other transportation committee
members. A couple of the Legislators had their pictures taken outside the hotel
rooms, and were sending them to their wives saying things like when this
complete, this is where we are going to spend our anniversary.
Jenifer Brandeberry noted that Brandeberry and Associates implemented
something new, thanks to General Manager Washington and Sherry Ellebracht,
offering conference calls to the transportation committee members. These
calls were not hugely attended but were hugely appreciated. The outreach
was made proactively saying “before you read about this in the paper” you as
transportation leaders, we want to offer you a briefing from our staff and from

tax. This year, we hired a different Pollster; we hired David Hill of Hill
Research. Hill Research has done a lot of work in Colorado, particularly on tax
issues, and he has the first preliminary draft which has not been approved. We
are planning to go into the field in the next 6-7 days.

our General Manager. Jenifer Brandeberry thanked General Manager
Washington and Sherry Ellebracht for working with Brandeberry-McKenna on
this project. She noted that their efforts show legislators that RTD cares and
that we certainly want to share information with them.

Based on the retirement of Representative Claire Levee, Brandeberry and
Associates have also met with Casey Becker, the new representative in
Boulder. Ms. Becker has extensive background and will be a great asset to the
legislature. There was one other recall election going on and that was for
Senator Evie Hudak, who was recently last elected to a competitive Senate
seat in Jefferson County; she elected to resign her position the day before
Thanksgiving, which allows the Democrats to appoint someone to fill her seat.
There are now two candidates in the ring, former Democratic House member
Sara Galardi and Arvada City councilwoman Rachel Zenzinger. BrandeberryMcKenna looks forward to meeting with whoever gets that appointment.
Jenifer Brandeberry shared that this means the Senate will stay in the
Democrats hands, and that it’s pretty unusual to have 3 new people midsession.
Other issues that may come up that RTD Board will have some interest in
beside flood stuff is the issue of construction defects. Many of RTD staff has
participated in DRCOG. That study has come out and there is lots of interest
from very diverse parties, ranging from housing authorities, to business
community to the metro mayors caucus. There are conversation going with
both the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate and that the
Metro Mayors led by Jim Gunning and Mayor Murphy are working on a smaller
subcommittee of folks to come together to review current trends and what
might be done to reverse the trends. Jenifer Brandeberry reported that no bills
have been drafted at this point, but Brandeberry and Associates will keep RTD
staff apprised of legislative ideas and that Brandeberry and Associates look
forward to working with RTD in the upcoming legislative sessions. Jenifer
Brandeberry then opened the floor for questions.
Director Folska wondered if CRL or Brandeberry-McKenna were aware that
CDOT was taking out public opinion on whether or not to move forward with
some commuter rail from Fort Collins to Pueblo. Maria Garcia Berry responded
that yes, CDOT has been doing a study for quite some time on whether they
would do a commuter rail project. It’s been going on for 3-4 years.
Director Folska wondered if there was a new public opinion, Maria Garcia Berry
Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 3, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Finally, Brandeberry-McKenna has done a lot of outreach; we have 3 new
members, not due to an election but due to two recall elections. BrandeberryMcKenna has met with a new Senator from El Paso county, Bernie Helpin, and
the new Senator in Pueblo, Senator Rivera.

replied this was not a new study; it has been an ongoing study.
General Manager Washington shared that there was a public meeting 2 weeks
ago where they presented on a commuter rail from Ft. Collins to DIA.

Jennifer Brandeberry replied that some of the changes can be viewed as
housekeeping changes and some are much more substantive. This reflects the
girth of issues that various folks from the CML and CCI, first responders,
brought to this committee to say let’s put everything on the table so that if and
when this does happen again, what can be done to be better prepared.
Director Menten then stated that the statutory changes could be in either 2014
or 2015; Jennifer Brandeberry confirmed that was correct.
Director Menten then commented that details appear to be pretty unknown at
this point on the 4th item on the list, Jennifer Brandeberry stated that was
correct; as things come up, Brandeberry and Associates will refer them to the
Board.
Committee Chair Daly asked to be reminded who will be the Chairman of the
Transportation Committees next year. Jennifer Brandeberry responded it is
now Senator Todd and Max Tyler in Lakewood. Committee Chair Daly thanked
Brandeberry and Associates for their presentation.

Director Menten noted on page 2 of the distributed memo, under the statutory
changes, Director Menten wondered if it would be a safe assumption that
would be the 2015 legislative session based on the constitutional changes
being passed in November 2014. Director Menten wondered if some of those
changes were just housekeeping changes.

B. Denver Union Station Update
Bill Mosher, Denver Unions Station Project Authority Board Owner’s Representative,
reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the
December 3, 2013 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Folska thanked Bill Mosher for his presentation. She said it is always great
to hear his description of how things are moving forward and the progress is very
excited. Director Folska noted that while she is from California and there are a lot
of great artists, she wondered why an artist from Colorado was not selected for the
art at Denver Union Station. Bill Mosher explained that it was decided early on that
Denver Union Stations Project Authority (DUSPA) would contract with the City of
Denver’s public art program. The public art program decided not to limit artists to
Colorado but to see what the interest would be nationally and even internationally.
Bill Mosher shared that there were between 800 and 1,000 submittals and this
artist was selected.
Director Bagley thanked Bill Mosher and Mike Sullivan as the Owner’s
Representatives on the DUSPA Board for getting the project where it is today. He
believes this demonstrates the strong working relationship between RTD and
DUSPA. He thinks it has really been a great effort on their part to be the Owner’s
Representatives; the presentation shows the quality and class of Bill Mosher’s
organization. Director Bagley stated that he is very appreciative personally and
thinks the Board echoes his sentiment. Bill Mosher noted that there are so many
people and organizations involved in the success of DUS and that have a great
working relationship. He said it was rocky at the beginning because there was no
money but everyone worked together. Bill Mosher stated that he is a great believer

6.B

Director Menten noted Bill Mosher’s statement that due to the art project being
steel there would need to be structural changes. She asked what the cost of these
changes would be and who would be responsible. Bill Mosher explained that his
team worked with the structural engineers who were able to easily accommodate
structural changes necessary to support the art piece in a fairly easy and cost
effective way. He said that they were negotiating the cost of the modifications
with the artist. He stated that since the Request for Proposal (RFP) RFP was
worded in a way that included all costs of the project his team feels it should be
part of the art cost. Bill Mosher noted that his group would be willing to come up
with funding if necessary so the artists could produce the piece; however in any
scenario this is not large sums of money.
Director Menten shared that several constituents have asked her what happened to
the artwork that was at Market Street Station. Marla Lien, General Counsel, shared
that many years ago there was an art gallery across the street that worked with
RTD to install their statues at Market Street for free. She explained that when they
moved they took their artwork with them as it was never RTD’s property.
Committee Chair James acknowledged the RTD staff for the vision to acquire the
Unions Station property; that vision created the possibility for this project to
happen. He stated that it has been great to watch the collaboration and
commitment to the project from all parties involved.
Bill Sirois, Manager of Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Planning, said that
as an addendum to Bill Mosher’s presentation he wanted to review the status of
the Wynkoop Plaza RFP process that staff is wrapping up. He reminded the Board
that there have been previous presentations discussing the process to look at how
RTD would manage the open space in the Plaza. Bill Sirois said that staff released
an RFP to manage the space in September and received on bid from Downtown
Denver Partnership (DDP). There was an evaluation committee made up of RTD
staff and area stakeholders who came to a unanimous decision to move forward in
the process with DDP. He explained that staff will be working to develop a master
lease with DDP where DDP will be managing the plaza as well as be responsible for
maintenance and programming. Bill Sirois noted that DDP has experience working
Downtown and can coordinate activities throughout the area.
Director Folska asked if DDP would be putting kiosks in the area similar to those
along the 16th Street Mall. She also wondered how long the lease would be. Bill
Sirois said that negotiations have not progressed that far but the plazas would fall
under the rules and regulations of RTD’s other agreements with DDP. He stated
that currently the lease would be for one year with a two year option thereafter.

Packet Pg. 19

that great projects get delivered in great ways because they become bigger than all
of the parties involved; this is a high quality project that is a national model.

6.B

Director Menten noted that at certain rail stops there are signs that say ‘No
Pedicabs’. She wonders if this is an RTD policy, City ordinance just for safety.
She asked how close the pedicabs can be to the stops. Bill Sirois said staff would
get back with Director Menten on further information related to the pedicabs.

C. Recommended Actions
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to
market and to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to dispose of
real property owned by RTD in the vicinity of WCR 27 and WCR #6 and #8,
Lot 1, Block 1, Aurora Highline Subdivision, Filing No. 4 (Alameda/Havana
park-n-Ride), remnants associated with the West Corridor Rail Line at 1395
South Zuni, and vacant land at 104th and Riverdale, Thornton, Colorado to at
least 90% of the current fair market value as determined by appraisal.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 17, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Susan Altes, Manager of Real Property, reminded the Board
that in April she and Bill Sirois provided an overview of RTD’s
real property and Transit Oriented Development policies and
practices. She reviewed the Board Report that is available in
the December 3, 2013 Planning and Development Committee
Agenda Packet with the Board.
Committee Chair James asked if the appraised value remains
confidential until a transaction takes place. Susan Altes said
that it would most likely remain confidential if we sold a
property through an RFP but in other cases people would
probably want to know the asking price and we would tell
them. She recommends that the asking price be at least 90%
of fair market value as outlined in the Board Report.
Committee Chair James clarified that this action would
authorize staff to negotiate prices for the properties and
execute a transaction at no less than 90% of the appraised
value. Susan Altes confirmed that was correct.
Director Tobiassen wondered why RTD would want to sell a
property for anything less than 100%. He also wondered why
RTD would sell the property to the adjacent land owner rather

Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 3, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program

than offer it to everyone. Director Tobiassen noted that there
is an art piece on our property at Alameda and Havana that
was paid for by the City of Aurora. He asked what would
happen to the piece. Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager
of Capital Programs, stated that staff always wants to sell the
properties for more than 90%. He explained that staff just
wants some flexibility to negotiate a sale if it is a bad market.
Susan Altes stated that the City of Aurora has known of
RTD’s interest in disposing of this property for a long time;
however, the sale will be made subject to easement of a parkn-Ride sign on the property. She said that staff could also
include the portion leased by the City of Aurora should we
decide to do so. Bill Sirois stated that staff coordinated with
the City of Aurora about our intentions so market the land to
the adjacent landowners and they support that approach.
Director Folska asked why RTD does not look at leasing the
property in Weld County for something along the lines of
fracking where RTD could get a lot more money over a long
period of time. Susan Altes said that there are no mineral
rights attached to the property; there are only water rights
attached to one parcel. Director Folska requested that when
staff goes to market the property they also market for leasing
the property with water rights as that is something that would
be very valuable.

D. Updates

• TOD Update
Bill Sirois reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the December 3, 2013 Planning and Development Committee
Agenda Packet.
Director Bagley asked if there has been any revival of activity on the old bus
barn that was tangential to the Alameda Station project. Bill Sirois explained

that staff would begin looking at a process for that parcel once RTD closed
with D4 Urban.
Committee Chair James asked when staff anticipated the closing with D4.
Marla Lien stated that staff was hoping for a January, 2014 closing.

Director Lasater commended General Manager Washington, Marla Lien, and the rest
of the staff on the visit from the Utah Transit Authority (UTA). He thought the tour
of Denver Union Station (DUS) and the bus facilities went very well. Director
Lasater noted that the UTA delegation was very animated and quite the
contingency including Board members, City Council members, staff, developers,
and legal counsel. He explained their purposes was to learn about DUS in the
hopes of duplicating something similar.

C. Recommended Actions

• Renaming of I-225 Rail Line City Center Station
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt the Aurora Metro Center Station name for the station on the
I-225 Rail Line currently referred to as the Aurora City Center Station in the
Environmental Evaluation document. This recommendation is consistent with
the current Board policy on station naming. It is also recommended that the
existing Centrepoint/Sable bus transfer facility located at the station area
also be renamed to be consistent with the light rail station.

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the December 17,
2013 Board meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Tina Jaquez, Public Information Manager for I-225, stated that

D. Other Matters
Rick Clarke said there was a pending organizational change that he wanted to
discuss with the Board. Jim Starling, Project Manager for the West Line and now
on North Metro, will be leaving RTD for a job in the private sector. Rick Clarke
stated that this will be a loss to RTD. He noted that Jim has come up through the
ranks, starting as a Construction Inspector, moving to Head of Engineering on TRex, and then becoming Project Manager on the West and North Metro Lines. Rick
Clarke stated that this will be a loss to the organization but changes like this are
not uncommon. He said that Jim Starling will be with RTD until January and staff
has already begun the recruitment process.
General Manager Washington provided the Board with a fact sheet on the
DesignLine issue. He noted that staff has discussed DesignLine with the Board
several times. General Manager Washington informed the Board that there was a
recent newspaper article stating that DesignLine owes RTD about $31K and made
it sound like we gave them $21 million; however, he stated that this is completely
untrue and inaccurate. RTD purchased two 16th Street Mall buses with a five year
option to purchase an additional 57 buses. He shared that RTD began testing the
buses in 2012. Staff came to the Board for approval of the purchase of 34
additional buses at a not to exceed cost of $24.1 million but RTD did not pay
DesignLine. General Manager Washington stated that our agreement with
DesignLine was to only pay them when RTD received the buses. He noted that in

two previous members and likes the diversity of the three new
members.

August Deisgnline filed for bankruptcy and RTD is still negotiating with the
bankruptcy court.
Director Tobiassen asked when we might get released from our agreement with
DesignLine so we can issue a new RFP. Marla Lien shared that when staff met
with the new owners they did not indicate they would voluntarily release us. She
informed the Board that RTD retained a bankruptcy attorney on the East Coast who
will petition the bankruptcy court that the contract be released. She said that staff
expects that to be granted but we cannot safely go out with an RFP until that
happens.

B. State of the District (Phil Washington)
General Manager Washington greeted the Board and provided a presentation on his
State of the District address reviewing 2013 goals, achievements and challenges as
well as identifying 2014 goals and anticipated challenges.
General Manager Washington shared RTD is a fiscally sustainable organization and
also sustainable with personnel, with our leadership programs and investment in
human capital. Staff has developed a learning and innovative organizational culture
that allows ideas that come from the bottom up.
The full presentation of the State of the District Address is available in the
December 10, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting Agenda
Packet.
Director Bagley thanked General Manager Washington for his comprehensive
presentation. Director Bagley inquired about a safety related issue, Positive Train
Control (PTC); he hadn’t noticed anything directly related to PTC in the General
Manager’s presentation. Director Bagley shared that he knows there has been an
attempt at the federal level to push for federal funding for PTC and wonders how
staff will be dealing with that in the coming year.
Rick Clarke noted that Positive Train Control is designed to stop the train
automatically. RTD have the PTC system embedded in our Eagle Project; this
mandate is applicable to all commuter rail operations as a Federal Railroad

Packet Pg. 30

Chair Anderson and Director Solano were absent.

6.D

General Manager Washington informed that PTC it is embedded in our Eagle
contract so we will have PTC on our Eagle project and is also embedded in our
North Metro contract. The history behind the PTC mandate was a result primarily
of the Metro Links accident in Los Angeles back in 2008. This mandate, as many
government programs, was an unfunded mandate. The Federal Government says
you will install PTC, but won’t provide the money to do it. The APTA’s position is
that the Federal Government should fund this requirement on the commuter rail
operations. The deadline to have PTC in place is December 31, 2015 for this entire
country. There is a scramble on right now for how transit agencies pay for
instituting PTC, when they’re struggling with the day to day Base-System state of
good repair operations.
General Manager Washington expounded that there is an East/West coast debate.
The West Coast properties, specifically in California, want that mandate and are
pushing for the entire country’s commuter rail operations to meet the December 31,
2015 deadline, mainly because they experienced that 2008 accident; where elected
officials went on the scene of the accident and saw bodies being pulled out, it was
a horrible, emotional experience.
On the East Coast, their thinking is that they have an adequate system and they
don’t have the money to put PTC in place. There is also the East Coast accident on
Metro North where they had a system that did not have PTC; the date is not here
yet but they say it is impossible for them to make that deadline. These are the
factors in the ongoing East/West coast debate.
Austin Jenkins noted that regarding PTC, staff could add that there are issues
related to technology. PTC is extremely complex; it involves radio, it involves
availability, it involves testing and proving of systems on a wide spread basis.
Austin Jenkins commented ultimately PTC involves the freight railroads; it’s not a
small issue that’s just limited to the commuter rail community, PTC really applies to
the entire country and the whole general railroad system.
Rick Clark confirmed that General Manager Washington is correct; staff has ensured
that PTC is in our contracts, both for the Eagle project and for North Metro. Rick
Clark stated that so far, he’s been assured by DTP and Waptec, the supplier; that
they’ll be ready at the time we start service.
Director Folska commented that General Manager Washington gave a great
presentation; that General Manager Washington, the SLT and everyone at RTD
have done a phenomenal job, yeomen’s work, particularly this year.
Director Folska inquired about the DUS opening dates. General Manager

Administration (FRA) requirement; it is not an FTA requirement which is the
government body that governs our Light Rail operation.

6.D

Washington confirmed that May 9 is the festivities; May 11 is the actual move of
operations from Market Street to DUS.

Marla Lien reported that nothing will happen to the parking lot on May 9th or May
11th. However, Marla Lien informed that the parking lot was part of the land that
was sold, along with Market Street Station. RTD reserved an easement for twenty
(20) spaces in whatever is built by whatever developer takes over the site. RTD
have the existing parking lot space until the space is developed; then we have to be
provided twenty (20) spaces somewhere in the Market street block when the
development occurs.
Director Folska shared that Bill Sirois, Kate Iverson and Patrick McLaughlin are
doing a wonderful job with Transit-Oriented Development (TOD); she hopes to see
RTD put in additional resources in 2014 to ensure that department continues to be
successful.
General Manager Washington noted Director Folska’s comment regarding TOD and
shared there will be a number of areas where RTD will grow, but RTD will grow
smartly.
Committee Chair Walker thanked General Manager Washington and everyone for
their presentations. Chair Director Walker shared that it is still great to be a part of
the RTD agency, and to ride the buses and trains every day.

C. Recommended Actions

• Resolution No. _, Series of 2013 Related to the Issuance of RTD Certificates
of Participation
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Reimbursement Resolution”), declaring the intent of the District to use
proceeds from a tax-exempt obligation in the form of a lease purchase
agreement to reimburse itself for certain capital expenditures made in
connection with the North Metro rail line project.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 17, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Packet Pg. 32

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 10, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska wondered what would happen to the RTD parking lot the Board of
Directors use when they attend RTD Board meetings, once the move from Market
Street to DUS takes place.

6.D

Doug MacLeod presented on behalf of Terry Howerter. Doug
MacLeod stated that this action item is a resolution to
authorize RTD to reimburse itself for costs incurred related to
the North Metro Rail Line project once the Certificates of
Participation are issued. The plan is to issue approximately
$480 million in Certificates of Participation to finance the
North Metro project in the early part of the last half of 2014.
However, RTD will be incurring costs prior to that date. In
order for those costs to be reimbursed from the proceeds that
we will receive later in the 2nd quarter of 2014, staff is asking
for the Board to approve this resolution.

• Radio-CAD/AVL Owner’s Representative Contract Sixth-Year Amendment
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with IBI Group (IBI)
as the Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL)
Systems (Contract 18DH016). This contract amendment is for the sixth
year, which is the final option year of the contract. The scope and fee are
renegotiated annually.
The sixth-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of
$2,400,000 for a total contract value to date of $12,022,000.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 17, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Doug MacLeod stated that this action item is asking for
approval to extend the final year option with IBI Group for the
IT support on the CAD/AVL system and associated systems.
Director Tobiassen asked for a quick update; he knows staff
went live with the 800 megahertz system this past year and

Discussion:

6.D

Director Tobiassen asked if there would be a future
maintenance contract on this effort and if IBI were part it. Eric
Farrington replied that staff is working on operation and
maintenance planning; IBI will not be providing any assistance,
IBI is only assisting staff with planning.

• Approval of Sales and Use Tax Compliance Review Contractor
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to approve a two
year contract with an additional one year option with Revenue Recovery
Group to provide sales and use tax compliance review services. The
contract will be paid on a labor hour basis with an annual not-to-exceed
amount of $607,500.
Motion:

Director Lasater made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 17, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Doug MacLeod stated that this action item is a culmination of
recommendations from the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force,
followed by direction from the Board to staff to seek out
supplementary compliance reviews with the Department of
Revenue (DOR). The DOR currently collects all of RTD’s sales
and use taxes and performs those services for us. This
contract would supplement those services; focusing mainly on

Packet Pg. 34

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 10, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

wonders what work is left to be performed. Eric Farrington
replied that staff is doing an expansion of the radio system
where staff is using some tower sites greater than the
capacity that was added; staff are closing out a lot of
transition issues and testing; staff are going through and
verifying system acceptance; and staff are also doing planning
for business processes that need to change as part of this new
technology implementation.

6.D

For comparison purposes, the November report received from
DOR resulted in assessments from their compliance reviews of
$310,000 credits of $43,000 so a net of $266,000 from
those compliance services and staff believe there are
additional opportunities for greater compliance. These
services will start in January, as General Manager Washington
mentioned in his State of the District presentation. This is the
action item to support one of the largest RAM items that will
fund the FasTracks internal saving account.
Director Sisk advised Doug MacLeod that he is in favor of
supporting this action item but is hopeful that since a thirdparty agency will be acting on behalf of RTD, that there is a
certain lessons-learned philosophy for this entity to follow in
terms of how staff wants the contractor to deal with RTD
customers. Revenue Recovery Group (RRG) has a job to do,
but Director Sisk prefers they perform their service without
using a hard or heavy-handed approach, as some collection
agencies do.
Doug MacLeod shared that within the RFP process, part of the
Scope of Work staff requested was qualifications and
experience. Revenue Recovery Group happens to have a fairly
large presence in the State and currently performs a lot of
work for smaller municipalities. They have worked with the
DOR extensively, and in our conversation with DOR, they
stated that Revenue Recover Group is one of their
recommended firms.
Staff does have safeguards in place; there are statutory
requirements regarding confidentiality which is part of the
reason RTD entered into an IGA with DOR before seeking the
RFP. Finally, Doug MacLeod reminded the Board the contract
is paid on an hourly basis as opposed to a contingency basis,
where there might be a tendency or perception that there
would be a more aggressive compliance review process.

Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 10, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

some of the mid-size companies in the district boundaries that
DOR does not have the resources to adequately ensure
compliance at this time. RTD did enter into an IGA with DOR
several months back followed by the issuance of an RFP. We
made a selection through that RFP process of Revenue
Recovery Group. This contract would be paid on hourly basis,
with a not-to-exceed amount of $607,500 the first year.

• October 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report
The October 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report was presented by Doug
MacLeod. Mr. MacLeod briefly reviewed some items on the Dashboard. He
stated that since the time the Packet was posted, staff is only 1000 riders
off therefore numbers are fairly accurate. The West Line had 419,000
riders, with October ridership the highest month to-date and staff does
expect to hit budget by the end of the year. Staff has received and will be
reviewing the CU Leeds December forecast, which will be presented to the
Board soon.
Several staff attended the 2014 CU Leeds Business Economic Outlook forum
yesterday. The CU Leeds presenters made mention, verbally and in a
handout shared with the audience, about the impact FasTracks construction
is having on the local economy; it’s the main driver in the construction
industry; the project is paying off both in income gains and in jobs. The
Leeds Forecast also expects retail sales to be up 5% in 2014 from 4.2% in
2013; this will bode well for our sales tax going forward.
Doug MacLeod stated that General Manager Washington had spoken earlier
in his presentation about a line item in our financial statement pointing out
the FasTracks internal savings account. Please refer to Packet Page 18, Line
Item 1.d.1.A – Statement of Position, the section where it states “Net
Position.” Note the item highlighted in a brown color; it notes FasTracks
Savings account at $5.5M ($5,563,000). Doug MacLeod concurred what
General Manager Washington stated in his presentation. This figure will
ramp up in 2014 with the addition of the sales and use tax compliance
audits, the Union Pacific Railroad relocation cost savings, etc.
Director Daly remarked that it is very good news that ridership is increasing
on the West Line; he wondered if staff had daily ridership numbers? Doug
MacLeod noted he could get that information for Director Daly.
Director Bagley commented that early on in the presentation on the

Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 10, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

D. Updates

6.D

Dashboard, there was discussion about ridership increases. Director Bagley
shared that it is apparent to him, the opening of the new service on the
West Line; a totally differentiated service, is the cause for the significant
increase in ridership. The increase is due to offering a brand new service
back in April, which is now starting to mature. Staff said it had the best
ridership in October; when we talk about growing ridership, it’s opening up
new service, especially a differentiated kind of service.

The Third Quarter 2013 Performance Report was presented by Jannette
Scarpino. The full presentation of the Third Quarter 2013 Performance
Report is available in the December 10, 2013 Financial Administration and
Audit Committee Meeting Packet, beginning on page 24. Ms. Scarpino’s
presentation was for year-to-date Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for 9
months ending September 30, 2013. The report narrative explains the
variances but Ms. Scarpino noted that some areas are showing improvement
in 3rd Quarter.
Facility Maintenance complaints are trending down from Quarter 1 and
Quarter 2; ridership is higher than it was in the first half of 2013. The West
Line and staffing challenges in certain areas is having an impact on final
resolution of customer complaints which has extended by 4.8 days. This
measure reports on all complaints, against all subject matter in the district.
Staff has not had the resources to rectify this delay but is examining
departmental responses and impact by department on this number; staff is
looking for ways to improve. Bus mechanic vacancies are higher than goal
but recruitment is continuing. Bus performance will be addressed in the Bus
Operations report later in the evening

E. Other Matters
Committee Chair Walker shared that this evening may be his last meeting as a Chair
and he wanted all the Board members to know “it’s been a blast”. He’s thoroughly
enjoyed working with everyone and all the Board members have been phenomenal.
Committee Chair Walker also reminded the Board that tomorrow, Wednesday,
December 11 at 11:00 a.m., the Board office is holding a Board Meet and Greet in
the Atrium; the event is also in honor of and a fundraiser for former Director Matt
Cohen.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Division 2013 Annual Report
Mr. Kenn Hardin presented the 2013 Annual Report and stated the full
Annual Report is included in the December 10, 2013 Civil Rights Committee
Board Packet and contains a wealth of information.
Kenn Hardin shared that this was the Civil Rights Division’s first Annual
Report to the Board as the Division was just approved last year, and the
Board approved the Civil Rights Committee this year. Mr. Hardin noted that
he will be introducing a couple of the Civil Rights Champions at the end of
the presentation.
Kenn Hardin stated that it was a great vision of our General Manager Phil
Washington to create the Civil Rights Division and the need for staff to
switch from the DBE Committee to the Civil Rights Committee. Staff is
better able to get an idea of the areas and functions that come underneath
the Civil Rights Division. Mr. Hardin extended his thanks and appreciation to
the two co-chairs; Director Rivera-Malpiede and Director Deadwyler for their
support throughout the entire past year.
Kenn Hardin reviewed a few of the 2013 highlights. The Civil Rights

Mr. Hardin shared often times small businesses say all they do is
subcontract. However, many of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
(DBE) and Small Business Enterprise (SBE) firms do move into Prime
Contract awards.
RTD has enjoyed watching several such entities grow into Prime Contractors
such as Sky Blue Builders, Rose Electric and Rodriguez Construction. The
Equal Opportunity Office provided educational training to over half of RTD
employees. Mr. Hardin reported that Mowa Haile, President and CEO of
Sky Blue Builders, is here tonight to comment on that experience a little later
in the presentation.
Mr. Hardin stated that 2014 Goals include taking the program on the road to
RTD District; educating internal and external constituents and customers
about what staff does in the Civil Rights Division and how staff supports our
organization so there is greater understanding about the Civil Rights service
functions.
The WIN program plans to introduce several new programs such as the
Ambassador Program and getting more young people involved in the
industry. The Civil Rights Transit Tech Institute will be another exciting
piece of the WIN program. As we move forward, staff will also engage in
fund raising activities to keep the WIN program active and alive.
The SBO is creating partnerships and training for business development
assistant programs. Staff wants to provide more programs like mentor
protégé programs, helping small businesses become more engaged and
having a greater understanding about building capacity in their business; and
offering far more capacity building orientation workshops.
Mr. Hardin commented that staff will also introduce Sensing Sessions within
the organization; helping different departments to become more engaged and
to increase morale; enabling staff to understand more about EEO and how
important EEO is within the RTD Organization.

Packet Pg. 41

Committee was established; the ADA program was approved; and the WIN
program was very robust. Mr. Hardin reported that the Program Director
was invited to speak at the Utah Transit Authority (UTA). Other agencies
were also interested in the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) Program. The
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) came to Denver as part
of their interest in RTD’s wonderful Capital Program; they also wanted to
take a look at the WIN Program.

Director Folska commented that the Civil Rights Division has put together a
really ambitious program. She inquired about the human capital available to
enable the Civil Rights Division to be successful on delivering their goals.

Mr. Hardin introduced the small business team: Adrina Gibson, Mica
Maniece, Amanda Murray, Martel Dyles and Dan Pearsall; the entire team
worked on this presentation.
Director Daly complimented the team and the quality paper product the Civil
Rights Division prepared. Director Daly also appreciated the ability to put
faces to names.
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede shared that it has been her distinct
pleasure to work with this amazing staff. Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede
commented that tonight was her last night to be overseeing and co-chairing
the Civil Rights Committee; that this is the best staff in the country sitting in
front of the Board.
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede stated that when she first started
attending the DBE quarterly meetings, they were not well attended; now it is
standing room only. Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede commented that this
Division has brought every diverse community into the equation to be part of
the process that we call FasTracks, WIN; and for creating opportunities for
folks to learn how to grow their business and learn. Committee Chair
Rivera-Malpiede thanked Kenn Hardin and his staff for their hard work.

 Civil Rights Champions Presented
Kenn Hardin introduced Zami Silva, Small Business Manager who introduced
a couple of the Civil Rights Highlighters for 2013. The first Champion is
Mowa Haile, President and CEO of Sky Blue Builders. He is one of the Prime
Contractors on the On-Call contract, where we have 3 DBE’s as Primes.
Sky Blue Builders is also on the I225 project where they just won a
maintenance facility contract. It is amazing to see the DBE’s growing from
Sub to Prime Contractors, which is the goal of the program. Ms. Silva
introduced Mr. Haile to say a few words about the experience.

Mr. Hardin replied that when he first started many years ago, it was just
himself. Currently the Civil Rights Division has a very robust staff of 22
staff. Director Folska advised it would be really helpful if the documents
prepared for the Committee Meeting Board Packets could be made available
for screen readers. Director Folska observed all other divisions have been
able to make documents legible for screen readers. Kenn Hardin committed
to address that issue.

Mowa Haile thanked the Board for the opportunity and for everything RTD
has done for Sky Blue Builders. Sky Blue Builders have been in business for
7 years and have 3 lines of business: Infrastructure - which is RTD type of
work along with CDOT as well as a lot of DOD paving contracts; a building
division which is tenant finish type of work such as maintenance on
buildings; and their 3rd line of business is land development.

Hopefully, 4-5 years from now, you will see Sky Blue Builders bidding on a
large contract. Sky Blue Builders acquired a full time WIN person in
accounting who is responsible for doing certified payroll, not only for our
RTD work, but also for the private sector, Federal and City work; Sky Blue
Builders are growing.
Rodriguez Construction - DUS, I225, Eagle P3 and West Corridor. Manny
Rodriguez, Rodriguez Construction greeted the Board and stated that
Rodriquez Construction was fortunate enough to get a contract at DUS 3
years ago. Work has snowballed into bigger projects and additional work.
Rodriguez Construction has been doubling its volume for the past 3 years. A
lot of Rodriquez Construction’s success is attributable to the RTD Projects.
Director Walker pointed out that the Civil Rights Champions are present
tonight because they’ve worked for it, they’ve earned it. They represent the
best. Director Walker thanked the Champions for the hard work they have
put in for RTD, and Director Walker expounded that the Champions are
helping to build the RTD agency into a great success where RTD can help
others in the industry, in the nation and the economy.
Director Bagley thanked Sky Blue Builders and Rodriquez Construction
for sharing their two wonderful stories. Director Bagley commented he
appreciated the Champions for coming down and sharing the stories
of their success with RTD and hearing about their opportunities to launch
into larger business.
Manny Rodriguez reported that Rodriguez Construction is also a Hub zone
contractor, a lot of the WIN participants fall right in. In order to stay
certified, Rodriguez Construction have to keep a certain percentage inside of
a hub zone, which helps on the federal side. Mr. Rodriguez informed that
about 40% of contracted dollars make it out in labor costs and this filters
out into the community.
Director Bagley thanked the Champions, advising it was very beneficial to
hear their stories.

Mr. Haile noted it is interesting that RTD Civil Rights Division state that the
DBE’s are their champions. RTD is certainly Sky Blue Builder’s Champion,
not only for the opportunity to work on RTD contracts, but also for helping
Blue Sky Builders to grow and become a Prime Contractor, which is the
spirit of the Civil Rights program.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the
not-to-exceed amount of $2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery
Unit (HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be made from the State of
Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of $322,103.
Committee Chair Tobiassen indicated that this item was being pulled from
the agenda.

• Increase the General Manager’s Signature Authority for the Rio Court
Maintenance-of-Way Renovation/Tenant Finish Project.
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager’s contract amendment
signature authority for the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way Renovation/Tenant
Finish Project be increased from $500,000 to $700,000.
Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 17, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities, explained that
staff has exceeded their signature authority at this point in
time due to Denver Fire Department requirements that were
unknown at the time this was originally approved.
Director Bagley remembers when RTD used imminent domain
to obtain this property when building the West corridor. He
recognized that there were questions about whether the whole
building would be razed. Director Bagley thinks it is great that
we are now going to use 75-90% of the building for a
maintenance-of-way facility. He thanked staff for their efforts
in reconfiguring this property.

Eagle Project
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to
approve the purchase of four Electric Multiple Units (EMU) cars for the
Eagle Project through the Denver Transit Partners (DTP), for an amount
not to exceed $18 million.
It is further recommended by the Operations Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to transfer $7.5 million
from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to the Eagle Project budget to
fund the purchase of the additional four EMU cars.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the December
17, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs,
stated that this is a request for the Board to authorize funding
for an additional 4 Electric Multiple Units (EMU) cars for the
Eagle P3 project. He explained that the reason staff is
bringing this recommendation to the Board now is due to the
stage of manufacturing our other EMU cars are in; this is
RTD’s last chance to get an EMU car similar to all the other
EMU cars we will have. Rick Clarke noted that in approving
the action to build the North Metro to 124th the Board
authorized the purchase of an additional 6 EMU cars. He said
that if RTD buys 10 cars RTD will get a better unit price per
car so this action will also help the North Metro budget. Rick
Clark said that $10.5 million would come from the Congestion
Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Grant from DRCOG and
allocated to the Eagle P3 project. The remaining funding
would come from a requested transfer of $7.5 million from the

6.F

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations,
stated that this is a prudent action for the Board to take. He
said that from staff’s perspective these are extremely complex
vehicles no matter who makes them. Austin Jenkins noted
that with the Siemens light rail cars, there was an issue
related to the breaking system that fell under warranty. He
commented that having enough vehicles to deliver service
while still getting the warranty is a great advantage to
acquiring a few extra cars. Austin Jenkins reiterated that for
his team, having a uniform fleet is critical; when a new car is
introduced into the fleet that requires new parts and training.
Austin Jenkins stated that another critical issue is having extra
vehicles for event service. He stressed to the Board that from
staff’s perspective this is a wise move and they hope the
Board will take action.
Director Bagley asked for a clarification on the number of cars
being purchased. He noted that the recommended action
discusses purchasing four cars but staff had also discussed 6
and 10. Rick Clarke stated that the original Eagle P3 order
was for 50 EMU cars. He said that when staff thought we
would build North Metro to 72nd staff asked for and received
approval to purchase an additional 6 cars. He explained that
this action asks for an additional 4 cars for Eagle P3 on top of
the 6 already approved. This order would be lumped in with
what RTD is already buying for North Metro to get a better per
car price.
Director Bagley commented that the video staff sent showing
the vehicles from the Hyundai Rotem facility was fantastic.
He asked staff to keep up the good work.
Director Lubow said that it seems smart to lower the price per
vehicle but said on the other hand, RTD does not have extra
money. She wonders if this $18 million could be better used
by putting the money into the fund to build the North Metro
line up to 162nd. She believes if we had all the money in the
world this would be very smart to do but she wonders if we
really need these cars in comparison to finishing FasTracks.

$30 million FasTracks Contingency Reserve. Rick Clarke
reiterated that if the Board does not more this item forward in
December, should RTD want to order commuter rail cars in the
future we will be doing a very small order and getting a car
that is completely different from the rest of the fleet.

Rick Clarke stated that staff struggles with the best use of
RTD’s limited money all the time; however, what staff is really
talking about here is $7.5 million that will not get us any
additional lines. He said that ideally staff would wait to make
a recommendation but they cannot. Rick Clarke believes that
if RTD needs any vehicles in the future we will kick ourselves
that we did not order them when we had the chance because
it will be much more expensive and they will be different
vehicles. General Manager Washington stated that whenever
staff brings a recommendation to the Board they do a costbenefit analysis. He said that over the past 4 or 5 years RTD
has been inundated with riders for special events. Staff
believes that ridership is going to exceed projections on Eagle
P3 and North Metro, especially as more of the system is built
out. General Manager Washington reiterated that staff
believes this is the best use of the $7.5 million and this is a
great price for the vehicles if we act now.
Director Lubow asked for clarification on the cost. She noted
that the recommended action indicated the cars will cost $18
million but staff is saying it will only cost $7.5 million. Rick
Clarke explained that the total cost is $18 million but of that,
$10.5 million is coming from CMAQ funding which is
dedicated to the Eagle P3 project; if we do not use the funding
on this purchase it will have to be used on something else for
the Eagle P3 project. He said that $7.5 million will come from
the FasTracks contingency reserve. Rick Clarke stated that
while staff does not like to dip into this fund, the purpose of
the fund is that is can be used when staff is faced with timing
issues like this. He said that staff’s goal is to replenish the
$7.5 million from the Eagle P3 contingency but they have to
wait until the project gets further along.
Director Lubow believes it is almost standards that there are X
amount of vehicles and RTD will need more. She wonders if
this is built into staff’s analysis each time so it is not a
surprise. Director Lubow thinks needed additional vehicles
should not be a surprise nor should the manufacturer giving us
a deadline to order more.
Rick Clarke said that staff has always been tracking this. He
explained that when staff does their analysis they look to buy
the least number of cars possible so projects can stay in
budget; however, if there is an opportunity to buy more cars
and the financial situation allows, staff likes to jump on the

General Manager Washington reiterated that purchasing all of
the FasTracks vehicles at once was one of the best decisions
RTD has ever made. He noted that in anticipation of building
North Metro RTD purchased additional vehicles and expanded
the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility without knowing
when the project would commence. General Manager
Washington believes RTD will dramatically exceed ridership
projections on the Eagle P3 corridors and this is an opportunity
to jump on vehicles at a good price.
Austin Jenkins told the Board that one of the things RTD will
struggle with is who we are. The building period is the
shortest period; this is the most intense period but really
operation and maintenance demand that when RTD can take
advantage of items that will pay off in the long term that is
what we owe the taxpayers. Austin Jenkins share that in L.A.
there are six different cars for six different lines; a mechanic
from one line cannot work on another because of the
differences. He reiterated that if RTD does not buy these cars
but later purchases different vehicles, this will be something
that operations pays for forever.
Director Walker stated that he will support this action because
the census figures show that is where the population is going
in the Denver metro area. He said this is the type of foresight
that he appreciates; in the long run it benefits RTD’s
customers and taxpayers.
Director Folska believes that RTD can purchase later and these
funds can be used for a better purpose. She believes that
even if we purchase vehicles now at some point we will need
more and will then have a mixed bag. Director Folska said
that she does not like to be pressured and this feels like high
pressure sales. Director Folska stated that she will not be
supporting this recommendation. She would rather see station
improvements or believes these funds should be saved in case
Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 10, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

opportunity. Rick Clarke stated that staff’s experience is that
when there is an opportunity to get vehicles at a reasonable
price take advantage of it. He reminded the Board that when
RTD first started FasTracks we bought all of the light rail cars
up-front before we knew if we had funding for all of the
corridors. At the time it seemed foolish but now it seems like
one of the best decisions made by staff’s and the Board’s
predecessors.

the money is needed should something go wrong. Director
Folska reiterated that she would like to see improvements like
signs, lighting, painting, parking lots, etc. Rick Clarke noted
that staff’s goal is to replenish the FasTracks Contingency
funds from the Eagle P3 contingency.

Director Bagley stated that this is an important Board decision
to approve something that makes the most sense. He
commented that if the Board looks at the fact that RTD has
close to $5 billion under construction, $7.5 million is fifteenhundredths of one percent. He reminded the Board that when
there is a project as large as FasTracks RTD has to be
adaptable, thinking ahead, and innovative. Director Bagley
recommends that every member of the Board look closely at
this action and see that staff is coming to the Board as
professionals in the industry and saying that they believe this
is necessary.
General Manager Washington stressed that the CMAQ funds
have to be used on the Eagle P3 project in some way before
the project is finished. He also expressed concern that if there
are funds not being used the FTA could claw back money as
they have been doing with unused Full Funding Grant
Agreement funds.
Director Hoy wondered if this order will be enough to supply
all the cars as the North Metro line goes to Highway 7. Rick
Clarke said that it depends on headway; if the North Metro line
has a 30 minute headway this will be enough vehicles.
Director Hoy noted that we have better headway on the other
rail lines. He asked if there was a possibility RTD would still
need to purchase additional cars at a higher price. Rick Clarke
stated that if staff had the funding available they would
recommend buying all the commuter cars necessary but they
are trying to be prudent with the funding available; this action
is recommending the purchase of as many vehicles as can be
purchased at this time. Director Hoy summarized that we are
in a stretch to get these vehicles, staff wants more, but they

Packet Pg. 52

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 10, 2013 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten wondered if there was a problem with the
braking system on the cars staff was recommending RTD
purchase or if Austin Jenkins was just using that as an
example. Austin Jenkins stated that was just an example of a
situation in which having additional vehicles was valuable.

6.F

are recommending what can be purchased now to take
advantage of pricing.

Director James stated that this falls into the category of risk
management; there are many potential positives and negatives
but he trusts staff to have the best judgment. He noted that
they are far better qualified to make this recommendation so
he is in support.
Committee Chair Tobiassen thinks that from a system
perspective, this will provide the managers with a great deal of
flexibility and redundancy for the system. He believes that in
a few years RTD will be looking back saying we are glad we
bought those extra cars.

Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the December 17, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
shared with the Board that the City of Englewood (Englewood)
applied for a CMAQ grant to demonstrate the effectiveness of
a circulator operated from the Englewood light rail station. He
said that performance during that period was very successful
and it operated at a low subsidy per boarding. Bruce Abel
explained that based on this, RTD took over the base funding.
Englewood continues to wish to make this a free service so
they make up the fares that would have been collected. Bruce
Abel stated that staff is recommending that RTD support this
again as performance continues to merit support and this is
the most cost effective method to run the service.
Director Walker shared the Englewood is very appreciative of
this service. It is a great service for the elderly and employees
to get to the local hospitals. He said that Sheridan is also very
appreciative because many people use it to get to work at
their shopping center.
Director Menten confirmed that the cost to RTD is $282K.
Bruce Abel stated that was the correct not to exceed amount.
Director Daly noted the number of passenger boardings per
hour is 30.9 with ridership averaging 828.3 boardings per day.

C. Updates

• Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 3rd Quarter 2013
There were no questions from the Board.

• 3rd Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis
Director Folska commented that in reviewing the complaints, it seems that
there is an ongoing problem with contractors not meeting RTD’s goals and
expectations. She believes this is also in alignment with contractors as it
relates to ADA issues. She requested that staff do an audit to try and better
understand the issues with our contractors. Bruce Abel said that staff
would do a more in-depth evaluation. He noted that there has been an
increase in customer complaints in the last several years, especially with
RTD’s enhanced fare enforcement policy and the priority seating areas.
Bruce Abel said that it would also be beneficial to create a category of valid
versus invalid complaints as currently any complaint is reported even if it is
proven untrue. Director Folska reiterated her concern that our contractors
seem to have higher complaints than RTD drivers.

• 3rd Quarter 2013 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
There were no questions from the Board.

• Special Services 3rd Qtr Report
Director Daly noted that under the Call-n-Ride Comments section there was
nothing on the South JeffCo Call-n-Ride. He wonders if that meant there
was anything of note. Bruce Abel said that those comments were related to
Call-n-Rides where it is staff’s desire to improve performance.

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that going forward, staff will be providing
Smart Card updates on a quarterly basis. He said that the highlight of the
program is that staff is completing the CollegePass update for the winter
semester. He shared that staff has begun the EcoPass renewal process as
current contracts expire on December 31, 2013. Bruce Abel said that staff
continues to work with Xerox on web portal improvements.
Director Hoy asked if the CollegePass issue with Metro State was resolved.
Bruce Abel noted that there were challenges with the renewal process for all
of the colleges as summer ended and fall started. He stated that staff has
been working through those issues. He said that he cannot speak to Metro
State specifically but he believes everything with the CollegePass has been
resolved.
Director Sisk noted that previously General Manager Washington indicated
that RTD did not need to have the full implementation of the Smart Card
program prior to beginning the Fare Revenue Task Force. Director Sisk
believes the more information the Task Force has the better handle RTD will
have on the adjustments that need to be made. He wonders why General
Manager Washington thinks this will not be helpful in making fare
determinations. Bruce Abel stated that there are two components the Task
Force will be evaluating: structure and level. He explained that to start the
Task Force will be focused on structure, meaning the types of fares offered
by RTD. This will be done through a lot of peer comparison and a focus on
the number of different fare products available. Bruce Abel said that this
evaluation will be independent of data from the Smart Cards. He stated that
when the Task Force gets to the next phase, which is the level at which
RTD should establish our fares, then the data will be important.

D. Other Matters
Director Menten wondered if vehicle break-ins was broken out in Park-n-Ride
incidence reports. Chief Tarbert said that he would get that information for
Director Menten.

Director Menten inquired about the report from the Denver Police Department that
was going to be sent to the Board. She indicated she had not yet received this
report. This report was sent to the Board as part of the November 26, 2013 Board
Packet and staff said that they would re-send.
Director Walker noted that the Board Member Meet and Greet on Wednesday,
December 11, 2013 was also a benefit for former Director Matt Cohen. He said
that former Director Cohen could really use the support from as many friends as
possible because he is going through a very difficult time.

Recommended Action
P. Resolution No. ___, Series of 2013 General Manager Performance Evaluation

Other Matters
Director Bagley indicated that even though the Board Effectiveness Workshop was
cancelled, he feels it is important that we tighten up our processes with some absolute
procedures, etc., on how frequently people can move or speak, etc. We need more
uniformity across our committees and Board meetings.
Director Bagley stated that he wants to see all of the Travel tics that were prepared in
2013. Each of the Board members receives $6000 per year for travel and he thinks the
travel tics should be a mandatory requirement for travel on the use of taxpayer’s funds.
Chair Anderson agreed on the importance of the travel tics and noted we have this as part
of our recommended request. However, in a previous conversation with legal counsel, it
was discussed not desirable to have one Board member try to control another. We will
ask legal counsel to bring us a legal opinion on the matter.
Director Daly inquired if any other agencies such as the CML require travel tics. Chair
Anderson responded that in her experience with CML and the City of Arvada, she did not
provide travel tics. Arvada did not have a designated budget and she always provided a
verbal report.
Director Hoy commented about the action item for the disposition of surplus land. He
stated that staff is moving in the right direction. It is good that we are using partners and
starting to market our property. He applauds staff for this effort.
Director Bagley added that our revised disposition strategy takes into account the types of
properties and how to best market. The white paper helped to define the issue.
Paula Perdue asked the Executive Committee to please help get the word out to the
committee chairs that their term is technically not over until a new Chair of the Board is
elected and appointments are made. That normally flows through one cycle in January.
General Manager Washington shared that he had met this morning with 3 stakeholders
selected to represent the US 36 group over the selection of BRT buses. It was initially
staff’s recommendation to exercise the over the road MCI vehicles. Staff has a concern
about having to go through the bus procurement for a RFP which is generally higher cost
and could attract small startup companies who want to be in the business. Staff has
already experienced this with a couple of small companies and knows some of the risks
involved. What they agreed upon was to go with the MCI over the road buses for opening
day. They will issue an RFI identifying the desired characteristics with national and

General Manager Washington shared that in early January, they will talk to the Board
about the process of MPACT 64. They will need to educate the Board about the process
and how the list of projects will work.
Director Daly inquired about what percent RTD will get of MPACT 64. General Manager
Washington responded that right now the agency including CDOT is working on an “AList” which 85% of the projects will probably get funded. The initial thought is transit will
get 1/3 of the funds on a statewide basis. Of this 1/3, RTD will get 60%. However, he
was quick to add that these numbers are being discussed and re-evaluated and could
change.
Director Hoy commented that it is important the Board members understand there are
multiple options for cuts and changes to this list. Staff will provide their recommendations
to the Board which could be changed. It could also be changed when it goes to the
MPACT committee.
Director Bagley inquired if it makes sense to wait until after the results of the NAMS study
to provide this list. General Manager Washington commented this is a timing issue.
Chair Anderson made these comments:
 She attended the APTA Board meeting via web. This is very exciting to see their
program for next year. There are recommendations from APTA that is important to
how we function. We hope to coordinate our issues with APTA for the conference
in March.
 One of things she noted from the APTA BOD meeting is they had assigned an adhoc committee to review all of their policies. She thinks this is a good idea and is
looking at a possible ad hoc committee to review our policies on record. This
committee would recommend change, deletion or modification to the existing
policies. She will ponder on how to do this so it is not a major drain on staff.

international companies to see who may be in the market for the replacement cycle later.
General Manager Washington also noted that he had conveyed his concern about if the
solicitation is not good for the District, RTD will state so. He is concerned about possible
pushback from the stakeholders. He made this issue clear to the stakeholders.
The committee indicated their general support of this position, noting that the type of bus
is an RTD decision and the Board will weigh in on any recommendation. Director Daly
noted that General Manager Washington had made a good point about why the low floor
vehicles do not work well along the US 36 corridor terrain due to weather, climbing hills
and other factors.

She spoke to the graduating class of Leadership Academy today. This is a
wonderful program and the participants are jazzed. The participants are doing their
regular job and working on projects in the Leadership program at the same time.
She had the opportunity to talk with the employees at Matt’s fundraiser yesterday
as well as some of the participants in Leadership Academy. Although the Board
got off on a rocky start this year, she was happy to hear that they believe the
Board is doing a good job. We have had many difficult issues to address. As she
looks at the issues ahead in 2014, she believes it is important that we have
consistent leadership and someone who is neutral about the upcoming issues. She
has consulted with her husband and for these reasons, she has decided to run for
Chair of the Board for 2014. She is jazzed to be a part of this agency and she is
proud of what we have accomplished.

Director Bagley commented how important the investment in human capital is and asked
General Manager Washington to comment on that next week.
Director Daly thanked Chair Anderson for stepping up to run for Board chair. He thinks it
is important to the Board’s image not to change Chairs every year. This is his last year on
the Board and he will not be running for Secretary.

Retiree Awards
There were no retirees present for the retiree award. Chair Anderson acknowledged June
Eckwall, Administrative Assistant for Safety, Security and Facilities, for her 19 years of
service.
Special Recognition – American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC) Awards
Chair Anderson noted that RTD has a great staff and that we are frequent recipients of
various awards honoring our staff. She turned it over to General Manager Washington and
Ricke Clarke who introduced these awards.
Ricke Clark shared that RTD was the recipient of two engineering excellence awards
presented by the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC). The awards were
presented at ACEC awards luncheon on November 18. The Table Mesa pedestrian bridge
project received a merit award. The new Table Mesa pedestrian bridge connects the
existing parking structure on the north side of US36 with a new bus stopping area on the
south side. This saves our buses approximately three to five minutes per trip. Civil
Engineering Manager Stan Szabelak along with design partner, Huitt-Zollars, accepted the
award . The West Rail Line project received an honors award. The West Rail Line is a
new 12.1 mile, $707 million Light Rail line that opened ahead of schedule and within
budget in April 2013. The project presented numerous engineering challenges including

Manager, Paul Von Fay along with design partner, David Evans and Associates, accepted
the award.

Al Moghtader shared with the Board that he received a fine for parking at the Alameda
and I-225 light rail station. He learned when parking there that his license plate is not
registered in the District. Al Moghtader stated that he lives in Roxborough and is only
15 minutes from the C and D lines. He is hoping there is something he can do to be
exempted from the parking fees without having to move. Chair Anderson indicated
staff will followup with him.
Doug Gragg stated that he had three talking points this evening. He wonders what the
reasoning was behind not including limited or express capability on RTD’s light rail
system. He noted that people have told him that parking is needed at the Red Rocks
Station. Doug Gragg also asked if there will be fountains at Denver Union Station; the
picture depiction shows fountains but so far he has not seen any.
William McMullen, former RTD Board Member, stated that he was fat and happy this
evening. He shared that when he ran for the RTD Board in 2004 he ran for FasTracks.
He told constituents that if they did not want FasTracks they should not vote for him.
William McMullen stated that coming from the South where they allegedly have it all
he says no we do not. The South will not have it all until the full system is built out.
He commented that RTD is still on time for the most part. William McMullen stated
that RTD has taken advantage of economic downturns to save hundreds of thousands
of dollars on the light rail. He said that he is not surprised to see RTD getting and
those awards mean something. William McMullen stated that when you go to other
places around the country you see that they are completely mismanaged while RTD is
at the top of the Peak. He thanked the Board for doing a great job.
Kathy Hodgson, City of Lakewood, thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak.
She congratulated RTD on the award for the W Line. Kathy Hodgson shared that she
was at the meeting to speak to the City’s support of Item M, Support of Lakewood
Master Developer Solicitation for Federal Center TOD Pilot. She said that on behalf of
the Mayor and City Council, they really appreciate the designation of a TOD pilot
project in Lakewood. Kathy Hodgson thanked all the staff that has worked so hard on
this program from both RTD and the City. She stated that General Manager
Washington has exhibited amazing leadership and great integrity. She also expressed
appreciation of the great work done by Bill Sirois. Kathy Hodgson noted the large area
of almost 70 acres comprising this project and how well three government entities
have worked together. She reiterated the excitement of the Mayor and City Council
for this project; this will be a beautiful community that really reflects the sentiments of
the community.

Chair's Report

Chair Anderson noted that on November 5, 2013, the Board received a report from
General Manager Washington regarding the recommendation from staff and the
stakeholder committee to choose Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH)
as the preferred contractor. She said that one year ago when the Board was approving
the I-225 Light Rail, no one thought it would be possible to entertain the thought of a
contract on North Metro; this happens because of dedication, innovation and hard
work of a team of people wanting to build a transit system for our area. Chair
Anderson commended General Manager Washington and his capable staff, the Board of
Directors past and present, along with local governmental stakeholders who have
worked together in good and bad times to get this done. Chair Anderson noted that
the North Metro line involves the Districts of five Board members. She said last month
she asked Director Solano to move the recommended action forward at the FasTracks
Monitoring Committee meeting and for Director Lubow to second. Chair Anderson
explained that this evening when it comes time to move she would like to have
Director Hoy make the motion and Director Rivera-Malpiede second. Chair Anderson
stated that this gives each of the Directors along the line a chance to be part of this
momentous occasion.
Chair Anderson shared that the Pine Junction Park-n-Ride Grand Opening was held on
November 2, 2013 with Director Daly speaking. Directors Bagley, Hoy and Lasater
were also in attendance.
Chaired Anderson thanked all veterans for their service. She noted that on November
8, 2013 there was a Veterans’ Day Luncheon attended by Directors Daly, Hoy, RiveraMalpiede, Sisk and Tobiassen.
Chair Anderson attended the Last Mile Connection Symposium on November 20, 2013.
She shared that both Directors James and Rivera-Malpiede were panelists. Chair
Anderson thought it was a great event and very successful
Chair Anderson reminded the Board of the Board Effectiveness workshop being held on
December 4, 2013.
Chair Anderson encouraged the Directors to donate to Operation Give-a-Gift. She
noted that there were boxes around Blake for people to donate. She stated that there
will be an Operation Give-a-Gift event at the Aquarium on December 16, 2013.

Chair Anderson reminded everyone that the Board office is having a fundraiser for
former Director Matt Cohen as he fights the battle of his life against Multiple Myeloma.
There will be a meet and greet with the Board members and a hot lunch will be served.
She noted that the cost is $10 and all proceeds will go directly to the Matt Cohen
Family Support Fund.

General Manager Washington reported to the Board that he was asked to be on the
2014 Military Service Academy Nomination Panel with Director Rivera-Malpiede. The
Panel interviewed young people that are applying for Service Academy slots. He
stated there were some very outstanding young people. General Manager Washington
said that he felt safer already knowing these young people will be going to our military
academies.
General Manager Washington shared that Monday, December 2, 2013, a delegation
from Salt Lake City will be visiting RTD. He said that originally staff through it would
only be staff from the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) headed by their CEO; however,
General Manager Washington shared that he just found out they will also be brining
several Board members as well as the Mayor. He explained the purpose of the visit
was to visit Denver Union Station and learn how the project was done, specifically the
financing.
General Manager Washington informed the Board that RTD’s Multi-Agency Exchange
Program (MAX) was just selected to receive a prestigious award and honor from the
National Transit Institute at Rutgers University. He reminded the Board that the MAX
program is an exchange program that RTD created with other agencies around the
country to learn best practices.
General Manager Washington invited the Board to the Grand Illumination Event on
November 29, 2013 at Denver Union Station where Chair Anderson will introduce
Director Rivera-Malpiede for comments.

Recommended Action
U.
Approval of Contract Award to Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors for the
Design and Construction of the North Metro Rail Line Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors ("Board") authorize the General Manager to award the design/build contract and
negotiate final terms with Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon Contractors (GBBH) to serve as
the Contractor for the North Metro Rail Line Project ("Project"). The Project consisting of
the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 162nd Avenue with a Notice to
Proceed to 124th Avenue, which will be constructed for a lump sum amount of US $343.3
million. Acceptance of this proposal would complete the North Metro corridor to 124th
Avenue with options to extend to 162nd Avenue as funds become available.
In addition, it is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into all
contracts, and intergovernmental agreements for the North Metro Project in the amount
not to exceed the remaining project budget to 124th Avenue of $633.8 million. This
authority shall include the ability to negotiate and execute all contracts; work orders;
change orders and contract modifications; and Intergovernmental Agreements that are
necessary or advisable to complete the North Metro Project to 162nd Avenue within the
scope of the North Metro Project budget and to accept grants or other contributions and to
increase the project budget in the amount of third-party contributions for project work. The
General Manager will also be granted authority to exercise the option to extend to 162nd
Avenue and issue a notice to proceed for that phase, should funding become available.
This option would be presented to the board through the annual budget appropriation and
with approval of financing provisions.
It is also recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors direct RTD staff to proceed with the submittal to the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) of an amendment to the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan (2035
RTP) consistent with the Project scope as described herein.
This contract provides major benefits to RTD, the FasTracks program and the entire
region.
 It demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the northern suburbs toward completion of the
FasTracks program.
 It provides a firm, fixed price commitment to complete a key part of the FasTracks
program. It also provides a fixed capital cost. The commitment to this cost and scope
is not likely to be available at a later time due to time escalation of prices.
 This proposal is consistent with the stated goals of the FasTracks program to seek
innovative approaches to delivering the program.

XIV. Old Business
Director Folska reminded everyone that RTD was a joint recipient of a Transit Alliance
award on November 8 for the Peoria Street Crossing. Director Bagley accepted the award
on behalf of the agency. Chair Anderson added that the City of Denver and the City of
Aurora were also part of the joint award. Altogether she believes there were about 8
different entities involved.

New Business
Director Rivera-Malpiede shared with the Board that she spoke with Terri Cohen regarding
former Director Cohen. She said that Terri Cohen extends her thanks to everyone that has
been so supportive. Former Director Cohen went through a stem-cell transplant very well.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that the upcoming week would be tough for him but asked
everyone to keep him in their prayers.
Director Menten shared that in light of recent discussion regarding the safety of the D Line
along the Welton Corridor, she rode the line to the 30th and Downing station after last
Tuesday’s meeting. She began her trip at about 9:30 p.m. Director Menten said that she
planned to wait at 30th and Downing for a while but it was just too plain quiet. She
decided to walk to 27th and Welton and did speak with several ladies who were out for the
evening. Director Menten commented that she spoke to them about the concerns they
had. She said that the women did not feel there was anything in their area to be more
concerned about than in other metro areas. Director Menten noted the women also were
surprised that so many stations were built in such a short distance. Director Menten
commented that while she walked she did not encounter any problems and felt the lighting
was sufficient.

Director Bagley said that last Thursday on a snowy day, he too went with John Perry and
Jessie Carter to ride the D Line to the end. He recommends that every Director ride the
Line to understand what is going on in the corridor. Director Bagley noted that the driver
of the train was on his first week but he conducted himself extremely well. Director
Bagley stated that because the corridor is single track there can be big issues if there are
any problems; while he was riding the train there were doors that could not be closed.
This created approximately a 20 minute delay. He said it demonstrated how problems
could really be magnified if this happened during rush hour. Director Bagley believes this
demonstrates that the closing of the station at 29th and Welton is imperative in keeping
the system running on-time.
Director Deadwyler stated that she is thankful and grateful that Board members are paying
attention to what is going on in this corridor. Director Deadwyler said that even though
Director Menten did not have any encounters, if people visit more they will get a better
flavor of what is going on.

Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to market and to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to dispose of real property owned by RTD in the vicinity of WCR 27 and WCR #6 and #8, Lot
1, Block 1, Aurora Highline Subdivision, Filing No. 4 (Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride), remnants associated
with the West Corridor Rail Line at 1395 South Zuni, and vacant land at 104 th and Riverdale, Thornton,
Colorado to at least 90% of the current fair market value as determined by appraisal.
BACKGROUND
In April, 2013, staff presented to the Board an Overview of Real Property and Transit Oriented
Development, including a discussion of regulations governing real property owned by the District and
other policy and operation considerations, including Federal State and RTD regulations, financial, current
and future operational needs, and transit-oriented development opportunities and goals to consider in the
management and disposition of RTD property.
A subsequent presentation to the Board in August, 2013 proposed a Pilot Program involving the four
properties that are subject of the recommended action of this Board Report. The Pilot Program allowed
for a diverse set of disposal considerations providing an opportunity to evaluate and review the process,
review lessons learned and propose any policy changes.
An Interdisciplinary Task Force was convened including representatives from Planning, Bus Operations,
Rail Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Facilities, Transit Oriented Development and Real Property.
The four properties included in the Pilot Program were reviewed, discussed and studied by the Task
Force for a recommendation to dispose of the property and a plan for marketing the property.
DISCUSSION
1. Property located in the vicinity of WCR27 and WCR #6 and #8, Weld County, Colorado containing
approximately 243 acres was determined to be surplus by the Task Force with no foreseeable future
need by the District. The recommended marketing plan for this property is to post with FOR SALE
signs, develop a marketing brochure for mail and on-line marketing. On-line marketing will include
the use of on-line brokerage sites such as LoopNet.com. The property will be sold with water rights.
It is recommended that the property be sold for at least 90% of fair market value as determined by
appraisal.
2. Vacant land adjacent to the Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride also known as Lot 1, Block 1, Aurora
Highline Subdivision, Filing No. 4 consisting of approximately 2.3 acres was also determined to be
surplus. The recommended marketing plans for this property is to market to adjacent property owner
including a car dealership at this location. The City of Aurora is supportive of this approach by RTD
and has suggested that the expansion of car dealership use at that site is appropriate. It is

Packet Pg. 88

11.A

recommended that the property be sold for at least 90% of fair market value as determined by
appraisal.
3. Remnants of vacant land acquired as a result of West Corridor Light Rail acquisition program in the
vicinity of 14th and Zuni containing approximately 1.6 acres have also been determined to be surplus.
RTD will be required to seek Federal Transit Administration concurrence in the disposition of this
property. It is recommended based on multiple inquiries related to this property, that a request for
proposal (RFP) for the sale of this property be issued with a minimum bid based on the fair market
value of the property as determined by appraisal. The RFP for this property will include incentives to
support transit-oriented, mixed-use development at this site as identified in the recently adopted
Federal Decatur Station Area Plan by the City and County of Denver.
4. The North Metro Rail project and station at 104th and Colorado will eliminate any need for a park-nRide at 104th and Riverdale as originally envisioned when this property was acquired. The plan for
marketing the approximately 8.74 RTD owned acres at this location is to pursue joint marketing
opportunities with the adjacent property owner. It is recommended that the property be sold for at
least 90% of fair market value as determined by appraisal. Any joint marketing effort agreements
will be reviewed by legal to ensure RTD is able to participate fully in all joint efforts.
Staff will evaluate each process, review and recommend changes to process and or policies based on
results of the four anticipated sales. Staff will review any recommended changes to the process and or
policies with the Board and will seek Board approval on changes to existing Board approved policies and
procedures.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
It is anticipated that the disposition of all four properties subject to this report could total $5-10 million.
Proceeds will be added to the appropriate account – either the base general fund or the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to market and to
negotiate and execute all documents necessary to dispose of real property owned by RTD in the
vicinity of WCR 27 and WCR #6 and #8, Lot 1, Block 1, Aurora Highline Subdivision, Filing No. 4
(Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride), remnants associated with the West Corridor Rail Line at 1395 South
Zuni, and vacant land at 104th and Riverdale, Thornton, Colorado to at least 90% of the current fair
market value as determined by appraisal.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to market and to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to dispose of real property owned
by RTD in the vicinity of WCR 27 and WCR #6 and #8, Lot 1, Block 1, Aurora Highline Subdivision,
Filing No. 4 (Alameda/Havana park-n-Ride), remnants associated with the West Corridor Rail Line at
1395 South Zuni, and vacant land at 104th and Riverdale, Thornton, Colorado to at least 90% of the
current fair market value as determined by appraisal.

RTD Real Property White Paper

Introduction
The intent of this white paper is to describe the real property management and disposition process at
RTD including how real property management interfaces with the TOD function at RTD. This white
paper outlines all existing RTD, state and federal regulations that govern RTD’s acquisition and
disposition of real property and identifies other policy (including TOD) and operational considerations
that need to be taken into account in this process. Also, this paper summarizes how other similar public
agencies approach real property management. Finally, this paper identifies some steps RTD may
consider to more proactively manage its real property assets.

Regulations Governing RTD Real Property
There are several state, federal and RTD laws, regulations and policies which govern the acquisitions and
disposition of properties. RTD must maintain compliance with these requirements.
RTD’s legal authority to acquire property is established in Colorado Revised Statutes C.R.S. 32-9-101 et
seq. “Regional Transportation Act” as amended. This legislation empowers the Board to acquire,
manage, and dispose of property in furtherance of the authorization of planning, building, operating and
maintaining a mass transportation system. This authority includes the power to condemn property for
public use. It is important to note that the authority granted to RTD by the state specifically defines
that RTD can only acquire property for the purposes of mass transit. Different regulations apply to the
disposition of property acquired by RTD depending on the funding source. The disposition of properties
acquired with local funding only are subject to the legal authority above and the Regional
Transportation District Resolution No. 10 Series of 1984 (Resolution Regarding Joint Development and
Disposition of Property Rights) attached as Exhibit A. Disposition of property requires RTD Board
approval.
The acquisition and disposition of property acquired by RTD for federally assisted programs and projects
are subject to acquisition and relocation policies and provisions contained in the government-wide rule
published in the Federal Register on January 4, 2005. The rules are reprinted each year in the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49, Part 24. All Federal, State, local government agencies, and others
receiving Federal financial assistance for public programs and projects that require the acquisition of
real property must comply with the policies and provisions set forth in the Uniform Act and the
regulation. The acquisition itself does not need to be federally funded for the rules to apply. If Federal
funds are used in any phase of the program or project, the rules of the Uniform Act apply.

Packet Pg. 91

Attachment: Real Property White Paper April 3 2013 (1785 : Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program)

April 3, 2013

In addition to the Uniform Act, the Federal Transit Administration requires Grantees to be familiar with
other regulations that specifically address the disposition of property, especially U.S. Department of
Transportation, Federal Transit Administration Circular FTA C 5010.1D Grant Management Requirements
dated November 1, 2008, Rev 1, August 27, 2012. The Circular establishes procedures to be followed by
grantees for the disposition of properties, including (1.) selling property (competitively to the extent
practicable) and reimbursing FTA its share of the fair market value, and (2) selling real property and
using the proceeds to reduce the cost of the grant if it is still open or of other FTA funded capital
projects.
A list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired without federal funding assistance is
attached as Exhibit B and a list of properties, vacant and/or underutilized originally acquired as part of a
federally funded project is attached as Exhibit C.
As a general rule, property acquired for a construction project is not considered for disposition until
after the construction contract is complete. RTD construction contracts generally make property
acquired for the project available to the construction contractor for construction installation, access to
the site or storage.

Other Policy and Operational Considerations for RTD Real Property Management
There are multiple additional policy and operational considerations that need to be evaluated in the
context of the management, acquisition and disposition of RTD real property. These considerations
should be evaluated in the context of overriding rules and regulations on real property discussed in the
previous section.
Key considerations beyond the existing regulations that govern real property management include:


Financial – management decisions including the acquisition, disposition or transfer of some
other form of property rights are influenced by the general financial conditions of the district
and the financial status of individual capital improvement projects. Examples of this kind of
influence include:
o RTD’s Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) – the RTD Board approved the potential to sell
selected excess properties for the purpose of adding revenues to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA). This consideration requires RTD staff to look proactively at
selling selected parcels no longer needed for transit purposes to raise revenues to pay
for FasTracks related improvements.
o Engineering decisions on capital improvement projects – financial considerations are
taken into account in acquisition of property for RTD facilities. Budget limitations on
projects often require creative thinking and design to minimize or avoid acquiring
property for RTD rail and bus facilities. RTD staff work very hard to take only property
that is absolutely required for construction and operation of RTD facilities.

Packet Pg. 92

Attachment: Real Property White Paper April 3 2013 (1785 : Disposition of Surplus Property Pilot Program)

11.A.a

o

o

Fair Market Value – RTD establishes the value of a property for disposal through a fair
market appraisal. An offer significantly below the appraised fair market value would not
be approved.
Certificates of Participation (COPs) – COPs are used frequently by RTD to leverage
existing RTD assets, including property, for the purposes of financing other RTD
obligations such as capital improvements. The utilization of COPs on RTD real property
must be considered since the disposition of property which is encumbered by a COP will
require that the COP obligation be paid off or transferred to another RTD asset.



Current and Future Operational Needs – RTD’s current and future operational needs are always
evaluated in RTD’s property management process. There are some parcels in RTD’s property
inventory that are underutilized and/or are no longer required for its original intended purpose.
In these situations, it is incumbent on RTD staff to evaluate not only the current utilization of the
property, but the potential for future RTD use. This is extremely important because disposing of
property should only be done in cases where there is no foreseeable transit need for the
property. RTD does not want to be in the situation where it sells an underutilized property and
then determines two or three years later that it did need the property after all.



Transit Oriented Development Opportunities – the opportunity for TOD is an additional
consideration in the acquisition and disposition of property. First and foremost, RTD can only
purchase property for mass transit and cannot purchase property for development. That being
said, RTD does want to encourage the development of transit oriented communities around its
stations and does proactively look for partnership opportunities with local jurisdictions and
private developers to implement TOD at stations. Forming partnerships with others may allow
RTD to avoid acquiring property for RTD’s exclusive use. Examples of this type of partnership
include the Olde Town Arvada station and the Westminster station where the local jurisdictions
acquired property to promote the integration of RTD bus and parking facilities into a larger plan
for transit oriented development.
Additional consideration may be given to TOD in the land disposition process. When certain
conditions are present including local jurisdiction support and commitment for TOD
implementation (the presence of an adopted station area plan, TOD supportive zoning and
commitment of funding for public infrastructure) and private developer commitment and
resources (ownership of land and expenditure of resources on design and entitlements) RTD
may consider reinvesting land proceeds for the purposes of enhancing the station environment
through the implementation of TOD. Examples of this include the Boulder Junction bus transfer
facility and the Alameda TOD Pilot Project where the RTD Board chose to reinvest land sale
proceeds back into the transit facilities that are being built or being reconfigured associated
with the implementation of TOD.

A review of procedures of other public agencies, including General Services Administration (GSA),
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA),
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and
various municipalities within the RTD district was done. All emphasize obtaining the fair market value,
as determined by appraisal of the property to be disposed of and most dispose of surplus property via a
competitive sale to the public generally through a sealed bid or auction. No marketing efforts are a part
of the disposition procedures.

Potential Modifications to RTD’s Real Property Management Approach
As RTD moves forward with the build out of FasTracks and the ongoing operation of its existing bus and
light rail system, modifications to RTD’s Real Property management could be considered. The
modifications would focus on being proactive where appropriate, but understanding that RTD is only in
the business of buying and selling real estate for constructing and operating a mass transit system.
RTD staff proposes the following steps in an effort to more proactively management its real property
assets:
1. Review and Refine Inventory of Surplus and Underutilized Property. Inventories of surplus and
underutilized real properties are attached. RTD staff will evaluate all properties contained in
either inventory, federally funded and/or locally funded and will focus on larger, possibly more
marketable parcels. Small/sliver parcels and other nonmarketable parcels will not be included
in the revised inventory.
2. Conduct an Assessment of Excess and Underutilized Real Property. RTD staff will form a
multidisciplinary committee to assess the potential disposition of parcels within the inventory of
surplus and underutilized parcels. In evaluating the inventory of parcels, RTD will consider all
the factors discussed in this white paper including regulations governing RTD property
disposition and other policy and operational considerations. Following the completion of this
evaluation, RTD staff will consult with select local subject matter experts to get their
perspectives on RTD’s real property inventory in the context of the factors governing RTD’s real
property disposition. RTD staff will then inform the Board of its assessment of the inventory of
parcels. If staff were to move forward with any property disposition, the RTD Board would have
to approve the final negotiated business terms unless the Board had previously delegated that
authority to the General Manager.
3. Develop a Marketing Plan for Select Surplus and Underutilized Property. RTD staff will also
determine if there is a need to market the surplus or underutilized property. Marketing efforts
could include the development of a Request for Proposals (RFP), the installation of for sale signs
on the property to be disposed of, communication with local commercial, industrial and/or
residential property brokers who sell property in the vicinity, or other efforts to be determined.
RTD staff does not feel it would be advantageous to hire a real estate broker to market

Peer Agency Approaches to Real Property Management

individual properties. Hiring a broker would reduce the amount of funds that RTD could receive
on the property because of the need to pay a commission to the broker. It would also require a
competitive solicitation each time a need for representation was identified, adding additional
time and cost to any disposition. In addition, none of the peer public agencies we surveyed
utilized a separate, private real estate broker in the disposition of real property.
4. Ongoing Process to Evaluate TOD Opportunities – RTD TOD staff will continue to proactively
pursue TOD opportunities where appropriate. As identified earlier, RTD will seek out
opportunities for partnerships with local jurisdictions and/or private developers where RTD can
leverage other resources to enhance our bus and rail stations and integrate transit more
seamlessly with development.
Other factors including market viability for TOD and
opportunities to encourage affordable housing as identified by RTD Board policy will also be
considered in the pursuit of TOD. When necessary, RTD staff will engage outside real estate
experts, on-call consultants and others to help evaluate TOD opportunities and negotiate with
private developers (RTD staff has utilized this approach for multiple projects including the DUS
Historic Building, the Alameda TOD Pilot and the Arvada TOD Pilot). RTD staff may engage
additional, outside experts on TOD under the following conditions:





The outside party has agreed to not compete or bid for the TOD opportunity for which
they are being consulted
Each individual TOD opportunity should be evaluated independently on a case by case
basis to determine the type of outside expertise needed since every project has unique
characteristics
Outside experts advising RTD should have a local understanding of the Denver real
estate market

Summary
In conclusion, the sale of surplus property can provide needed revenue to RTD and relieve the District of
the cost to maintain these properties. RTD will take additional steps to inventory, access and market
surplus properties. However, as described in this paper, the disposition of property is a complex
endeavor that must take into account legal, financial, contractual, and future operational requirements
while also considering transit oriented development opportunities where applicable. As we continue to
improve our processes in this area, we will schedule a study session to gather input from the RTD Board
on this very important item.

Board Meeting Date: December 17, 2013

Subject:

Renaming of I-225 Rail Line City Center Station

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Aurora
Metro Center Station name for the station on the I-225 Rail Line currently referred to as the Aurora City
Center Station in the Environmental Evaluation document. This recommendation is consistent with the
current Board policy on station naming. It is also recommended that the existing Centrepoint/Sable bus
transfer facility located at the station area also be renamed to be consistent with the light rail station.
BACKGROUND
During the Environmental Evaluation process it was determined that a light rail Park-n-Ride station at
Sable Boulevard and Centerpoint Drive would be an appropriate location because of the existing bus
transfer facility. Proximity to the facility would provide efficient connections between multiple bus routes
and the future light rail route. The City of Aurora has expressed an interest in renaming the station the
Aurora Metro Center Station and on September 9, 2013, Aurora City Council passed a resolution
supporting the change of the name.
DISCUSSION
The City of Aurora Council supports this change because they believe it better reflects the station that
will serve Aurora citizens and visitors. The City envisions the station to be a vital element of the future
main street area of Aurora. The City also believes the name change will fit better with the future
development plans for the area around the station.
There currently is a bus transfer station adjacent to the future light rail station and since it is integral to
connectivity to RTD services including light rail and bus, it is important the name represent both the rail
and bus components.
The May 2011 Board Station Naming Policy revision grants the Board flexibility in allowing station
naming and the proposed station name fits the general criteria established by the Board as follows:
a. The proposed name is recognizable as a general geographic area to the public;
b. The name does not incorporate any trademark name;
c. The station is not set to open until 2016 (which is more than two years away); and
d. The name does not violate any existing naming agreement.
Consequently, the proposed station name is consistent with the Board station naming policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommendation would have no immediate financial impact on RTD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors adopt the Aurora Metro Center Station name for the station on the I-225 Rail
Line currently referred to as the Aurora City Center Station in the Environmental Evaluation

document. This recommendation is consistent with the current Board policy on station naming. It is
also recommended that the existing Centrepoint/Sable bus transfer facility located at the station area
also be renamed to be consistent with the light rail station.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and request the City of Aurora to consider further
alternatives. This action is not recommended since this name no longer reflects the plans of the City
or adjacent property holder.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and keep the station name as identified in the I-225
Environmental Evaluation. This action is not recommended since this name no longer reflects the
plans of the City of Aurora or adjacent property owner.

Subject:

Station Names for Eagle P3 Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
following station name changes for the Eagle P3 Project. For comparison, the current station names in
use are shown in parentheses.
Gold Line:
Pecos Junction (change from Pecos)
Clear Creek • Federal (change from Federal)
60th & Sheridan • Arvada Gold Strike (change from Sheridan)
Wheat Ridge • Ward (change from Ward Road)
East Corridor:
40th Ave. & Airport Blvd. • Gateway Park (change from 40th Ave. & Airport Blvd)
Denver Airport (change from Denver International Airport)
BACKGROUND:
Station names were originally assigned during the Gold Line Corridor and East Corridor Environmental
Impact Statements, both completed in 2009, and the Northwest Rail Corridor Environmental Evaluation
completed in 2010. These initial names were based on geographic locations and have been used on
plans, fact sheets and the website. Denver Transit Partners, the concessionaire on the Eagle P3 Project,
has given the Eagle Design Team a deadline of December 31, 2013, to confirm the official station names
in order for it to integrate the names into the signage design package, systems packages for LED and
LCD monitor displays, and audio announcements; and operations documents.
The Board previously voted to change the names of two stations on the Eagle P3 Project. On September
20, 2011, the Board approved changing the name of the East Corridor’s Colorado Station to 40th &
Colorado, based on Denver Fire’s request to differentiate the location from the existing Colorado Station
on the Southeast light rail corridor. Subsequently, on November 22, 2011, the Board approved changing
the name of the Northwest Rail Corridor’s South Westminster Station to Westminster Station, based on
a formal request from the City of Westminster to better fit into its land use planning in that area.
In order to respond to DTP’s deadline, Eagle Project staff met in early September with RTD Marketing to
apply RTD’s station naming policy to the station names on the project. Following that discussion, the
staff recommended these names, with three of them changed from their current names:
Northwest Rail Corridor:
Westminster (no change)
Gold Line Corridor:
41st & Fox (no change)
Pecos (no change)
60th & Federal

Packet Pg. 106

11.C

60th & Sheridan
Olde Town Arvada (no change)
Arvada Ridge (no change)
Wheat Ridge • Ward
East Corridor:
38th & Blake (no change)
40th & Colorado (no change)
Central Park (no change)
Peoria (no change)
40th & Airport (no change)
Denver International Airport (no change)
In Mid-September, the Eagle Design Team issued official letters to the six local governments on the
project to advise them of the proposed station names and provide them with the opportunity to request
alternate station names, if deemed appropriate and conforming to all the requirements of the RTD
Station Naming Policy. Local governments also would have to submit a completed RTD Station Naming
Form. The goal was to avoid later requests from stakeholders after DTP’s deadline.
DISCUSSION:
After RTD notified the local governments of the RTD recommended station names, RTD received the
following change requests:
Adams County requested the station at Pecos be changed to Pecos Junction.
Staff Recommendation: Change to Pecos Junction
This proposal supports Adams County’s land use planning for the southwest portion of the county along
the Gold Line and Northwest Rail, and takes its name from the geographical location of the physical
track interlock – or junction – where the Northwest Rail and Gold Line diverge from their shared
alignment south to Union Station.
Adams County requested the station at 60th & Federal be changed to Clear Creek • Federal.
Staff Recommendation: Change to Clear Creek • Federal
This proposal also supports Adams County’s land use planning for the southwest portion of the county.
It resolves the issue of multiple stations containing “Federal.” For fire and life safety reasons, it is
important to eliminate duplicate station names in the system and distinguish this station from West
Corridor’s Federal Center and Decatur • Federal stations. It adds a geographical identifier to the name,
including Clear Creek and the Clear Creek Trail, which can be accessed across 60th Avenue from this
station.
The City of Arvada requested the station at 60th & Sheridan be changed to 60th & Sheridan • Arvada
Gold Strike.
Staff Recommendation: Change to 60th Ave & Sheridan • Arvada Gold Strike
The proposal resolves the issue of multiple stations starting with “Sheridan” while also including a
geographical and historical identifier that is important to the City of Arvada. It is important to distinguish
this station from Sheridan Station on the West Corridor. The station is located less than a half mile from
the site of the first gold strike in what was to become the state of Colorado, in 1850 at Ralston Creek’s

Packet Pg. 107

11.C

confluence with Clear Creek. Arvada’s Gold Strike Park is located there. The Gold Line takes its name
from this historical point of fact.
The City of Aurora requested the station at 40th Ave & Airport Blvd be changed to 40th Ave & Airport
Blvd • Gateway Park.
Staff Recommendation: Change to 40th Ave & Airport Blvd • Gateway Park
The proposal includes the Gateway Park neighborhood in the station name while adhering to RTD policy
of listing street location identification. It also follows the precedent set at several stations including
Stapleton park-n-Ride, Southmoor Station and Arapahoe at Village Center Station. The 40th & Airport
Blvd park-n-Ride is an existing RTD facility, and under RTD policy third parties are to be responsible for
costs of changing the name. The master developer of the Gateway Park area has agreed to cover the
costs of updating station signage.
The City and County of Denver requested the station at Denver International Airport be changed to
Denver Airport.
Staff Recommendation: Change to Denver International Airport to Denver Airport
The proposal retains the most important element, that of the prominent destination. Airport managers
prefer the shorter name to facilitate designation on maps, signs and Ticket Vending Machines. More
importantly, airport managers have undertaken a marketing effort to reduce the use of the term “DIA,”
which is not the Airport Code known to most travelers. The Denver airport’s code is DEN. Airport
managers are concerned that visitors to Denver, who will make up a higher percentage of riders on the
East Corridor than other RTD rail lines, not face confusion when looking at maps or schedules by seeing
“DIA” as shorthand for the DEN rail station. It is likely that going forward, there will be more effort to
reduce the use of the word “International” in the airport’s name as well, so changing this station’s name
now eliminates the potential need to go through the expense of changing it later. RTD staff concurs with
the reasoning of airport managers for removing “International” from the station name and reducing the
likelihood of use of “DIA Station.” Clarity and consistency are important elements in communicating with
visitors to DEN and our new rail station there.
Staff Recommendation: Change to Ward Road to Wheat Ridge • Ward
In addition to changes requested by local governments, RTD staff recommends changing the name of
the Ward Road Station on the Gold Line to Wheat Ridge • Ward. This change is consistent with current
RTD policy. With only one exception, RTD does not use street name suffixes such as “St,” “Ave” or
“Blvd” as part of the station name. In addition to dropping “Road,” the recommendation adds the city’s
name, more consistent with the West Corridor’s “Lakewood • Wadsworth” and Southwest Corridor’s
“Littleton • Downtown” and “Littleton • Mineral.”
No Board action is required for the remaining Eagle P3 Project station names, which are unchanged.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no negative financial impact to the project at this time. DTP is requiring RTD confirmation of the
official Station Names prior to December 31, 2013, in order to avoid costs that would be incurred with
changing station names after DTP commences with station signage and systems packages. RTD sought
local government input now in order to avoid redesign costs later. Any station name changes after
December 31, 2013, would have cost implications to either RTD or stakeholders.

ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the following station name changes for the Eagle P3 Project. For
comparison, the current station names in use are shown in parentheses.
Gold Line:
Pecos Junction (change from Pecos)
Clear Creek • Federal (change from Federal)
60th & Sheridan • Arvada Gold Strike (change from Sheridan)
Wheat Ridge • Ward (change from Ward Road)
East Corridor:
40th Ave. & Airport Blvd. • Gateway Park (change from 40th Ave. & Airport Blvd)
Denver Airport (change from Denver International Airport)
2. Accept the initial RTD staff recommended three station name changes, not including the key
stakeholder requested changes: 60th & Federal, 60th & Sheridan, and Wheat Ridge • Ward. This is
not recommended as it is not responsive to key stakeholders’ land use planning and marketing
strategies around RTD rail stations, and invites renewed attempts to revisit station names after DTP’s
deadline, which would incur costs.
3. Do not accept the recommended action. Instead leave the names as currently defined. This is not
recommended as it would not be responsive to key stakeholders making the request. In addition, it
would leave in place several duplicate or similar rail station names in the RTD system at the risk of
fire and life safety response in emergency dispatch situations. The Board already has changed the
Colorado Station name to 40th & Colorado based on this reasoning.

approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Reimbursement Resolution”), declaring the intent of
the District to use proceeds from a tax-exempt obligation in the form of a lease purchase agreement
to reimburse itself for certain capital expenditures made in connection with the North Metro rail line
project.
BACKGROUND:
The District is currently in the process of negotiating a contract with Graham, Balfour Beatty, Hamon
Contractors for the design and construction of the North Metro rail line project. The FasTracks
budget anticipates that the North Metro rail line project will be partially financed with lease purchase
obligations (“Certificates of Participation” or “COPs”).
DISCUSSION:
Under a COP structure, RTD leases certain assets and makes rental payments under a lease, subject
to appropriation by the Board of Directors. The COPs are sold to investors and are evidenced by
assignments of proportionate interests in the rights to receive payments under the lease. The leased
assets serve as collateral for the COPs such that, in the event of RTD non-appropriation or default,
the assets may be sold, leased, repossessed, liquidated or otherwise disposed of with proceeds being
utilized to redeem COPs.
With limited exceptions, proceeds from COPs may not be used to reimburse the issuer for expenses
made prior to the execution and delivery of the lease unless the issuer has executed a reimbursement
resolution similar to the attached Reimbursement Resolution. Reimbursement resolutions similar to
this one have been adopted by the Board in the past for bond and COP issuances.
In order to allow the District to finance any expenditures related to the leased assets which may
occur prior to the execution of the financing, the Board is being requested to adopt the
Reimbursement Resolution.
It is currently anticipated that the COPs will be issued in April of 2014. The lease, indenture, official
statement and other pertinent documents will be presented to the Board of Directors for review and
approval prior to the marketing of the COPs.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisor on the
transaction.

Packet Pg. 113

11.E

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Lease rent and lease interest costs on the COPs are included in the 2014 budget. Costs associated
with the issuance of the securities will be funded out of COP proceeds. These costs include
underwriters’ discount, financial advisory fees, attorneys’ fees, printing costs and the like.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.

Authorize Resolution No. ___, Series of 2013 declaring the intent of the District to use
proceeds from a tax-exempt obligation in the form of a lease purchase agreement to
reimburse itself for certain capital expenditures made in connection with the North Metro
rail line project. This is the recommended action.

2.

Do not authorize Resolution No. ___, Series of 2013 declaring the intent of the District to
use proceeds from a tax-exempt obligation in the form of a lease purchase agreement to
reimburse itself for certain capital expenditures made in connection with the North Metro
rail line project. This is not the recommended action and may disallow the District from
reimbursing itself for any expenses made prior to the close of the transaction.

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 5, 2013

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

December 4, 2013

Board Meeting Date: December 17, 2013

Subject:

Radio-CAD/AVL
Owner’s
Representative
Contract Sixth-Year Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend the
contract with IBI Group (IBI) as the Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Systems (Contract 18DH016).
This contract amendment is for the sixth year, which is the final option year of the contract. The scope
and fee are renegotiated annually. The sixth-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of $2,400,000 for a total
contract value to date of $12,022,000.

BACKGROUND
RTD has been in the process of replacing our radio and CAD/AVL system over the past several years.
RTD formerly operated a 450MHz analog radio communication system that supported voice and data
communications between dispatchers, bus and light rail operators, Transit Police and field support staff
for RTD’s operations. The radio system was integrated with the CAD/AVL system. The system was
initially implemented in 1993 and was past the last years of the industry’s common 15-year service life.
Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required changes to the available radio
frequency bandwidth, which were not compatible with the former radio and CAD/AVL design. This
narrow-banding requirement has been met.
The scope of work and fee for this Board-approved contract is negotiated annually to allow the contract
to adjust to changes related to the design choices RTD makes. Although the installations are complete
and the system is operational, there are many remaining efforts required as a foundation for the
extended operations and maintenance of the systems, processes and infrastructure. These and a few
supplemental assignments include general program management, documentation of various elements,
activity planning and administration, establishment of ongoing long-term operations and maintenance
structure, and a variety of system acceptance testing.
RTD requires the services of an Owner’s Representative (OR) for the Radio-CAD/AVL Replacement
Project to provide highly technical, managerial, business services to support the agency through the final
stages of the project and planning for moving into operations. The OR will provide unique technical
skills unavailable internally to RTD.
RTD issued Contract No. 18DH016 to obtain an Owner’s Representative for the Radio-CAD/AVL
Replacement Project. IBI was selected in 2009 by competitive procurement to be RTD’s Owner’s
Representative for the Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project. The contract requires eight (8) percent
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) participation. IBI is currently exceeding their goal.

Packet Pg. 119

11.F

This is a complex and dynamic project. IBI has successfully completed the work anticipated for the
earlier years and it is in RTD’s interest to authorize a contract amendment for the sixth year of the
contract to continue needed support.
DISCUSSION
This is the start of the optional sixth year of a Board-approved contract. Due to the complexity and
changing conditions of the project, each year’s scope of work and fee are reviewed and negotiated
annually.
Although implementation for the CAD/AVL project is winding down, significant work remains to conduct
system acceptance testing, review and finalize as-built documentation, develop reporting, and conduct
planning to move into operations and maintenance of the system.
The anticipated sixth-year activities are:








Final system acceptance testing, which will extend well into 2014
Implementation of pending INIT contract amendments, addressing elements such as the HOP and
Call-n-Ride installations and enhancements
Radio system capacity expansion
Testing and implementation of subsequent phases of Smart Media Technology
Disaster Recovery (DR) and Continuation of Operations Plan (CoOP) update and implementation
Study of scheduling tools feeding the CAD system for service optimization and operational
interactions with fleet and resource management
General Intelligent Transportation System / CAD / Communications consultancy demands in
support of RTD operations and FasTrack activities.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost to the District for amending the Owner’s Representative contract with IBI Group for the sixth
year is a not-to-exceed cost of $2,400,000. Funding has been included in the 2014 Finance and
Administration Department’s Information Technology Division capital and operating budget. The
contract values for the first five years is cumulatively $9,622,000 and with this 6th year addition total
award is $12,022,000.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the request for the Radio-CAD/AVL Replacement Project Owner’s Representative
contract amendment which will reduce risk and allow current RTD employees to continue
focusing on operating and improving the system. This is the staff recommended action.
2. Attempt to accomplish the project with in-house staff. RTD staff does not have the necessary
skills or available resources to undertake this project.
If the IBI agreement is not approved and these resources are not available, the project would proceed
with a combination of Work Order contractors and RTD staff. It is likely that Alternative 2 will incur
additional cost for another vendor’s learning curve.

Subject:

Architectural / Engineering Contract with Short
Elliot Hendrickson (SEH), Contract 11 DO-025 Contract Amendment.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to amend contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional
architectural / engineering design services in the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed
contract amount of $3,000,000. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended
amount is to be funded by various Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing
projects under contract.
BACKGROUND
Services rendered under this contract provide mechanical, civil, architectural, electrical, structural, and
landscaping, design and engineering services for the development of selected projects included in RTD's
SBP program and grant funded projects. The contract duration was specified for a three year term from
October 13, 2011 to October 13, 2014 with award being in the amount of $500,000. Allowable, are
two, one-year extensions to the contract. This board action is to increase the existing not-to-exceed limit
in the contract. All other terms and conditions of the contract remain unchanged. Consultant
responsibilities include preparation of drawings and specifications for construction in addition to
estimating and other construction related services such as change order documentation, preparation of
as-built drawings, and site inspections. The purpose of this contract is to assist the Facilities Engineering
Division with design services that cannot be completed with in-house staff.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract amount was $500,000. In May of 2012 the Board approved an additional
$1,500,000 that was based primarily on the Civic Center rehabilitation project. To date, including the
Civic Center project the contract has obligated $1,931,381 for nine projects leaving a contractual
balance of $68,619. Additional funding to the contract is required to accommodate approved 2014
through 2015 SBP projects.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
This contract does not have a SBE/DBE goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This contract utilizes grant and local funds. The types of funds are dependent upon the funding source
of each individual project. Individual work orders will be funded as the project requirement is processed.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to amend contract 11 DO025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in the amount of
$1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $3,000,000. Work is administered on

an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract.
2. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to amend
contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in
the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $3,000,000. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract. Not
accepting the recommended action is not recommended because it would delay the schedule of
the approved 2014 SBP projects.
3. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to amend
contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in
the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $3,000,000. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract.
Instead, proceed with the implementation of a new Architectural / Engineering RFP for a contract
with a new consultant team. This is not recommended because of the delay it will cause on the
approved 2014 SBP projects.

Subject:

Increase the General Manager’s Signature
Authority for the Rio Court Maintenance-ofWay Renovation/Tenant Finish Project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager’s contract amendment signature authority for the Rio Court Maintenanceof-Way Renovation/Tenant Finish Project be increased from $500,000 to $700,000.
BACKGROUND
The site/facility was acquired to accommodate the relocation of the Burnham Yard lead track due to
construction of the West Line project. The lead track that was relocated was aligned through the south
end of the property. The original plan was to raze the entire building that resided on the site. After
consideration, it was determined to remove only a portion of the building and utilize the rest for a new
light rail maintenance-of-way (MOW) facility needed to accommodate growth of the light rail system.
The renovated facility will house all light rail MOW requirements to maintain all track work, signal,
communication and power systems for all RTD light rail corridors including the West Line and I-225. All
functions will be relocated from the existing Mariposa MOW facility that no longer accommodates light
rail’s expanded needs.
DISCUSSION
The Board authorized award to Calahan Construction in March of 2013 in the amount of $3,472,630.
To date, two amendments have been processed for a total of $123,511. Some of these unforeseen
conditions were; a new fire hydrant, waste water utility upgrades for code compliance, communication
feed by Century Link, and fire sprinkler revisions to comply with Denver Fire Department codes. Pending
changes include; a second fire hydrant which includes a fire loop, RTD security equipment, suitable
backfill dirt for utility trenches, and the utility connection from the facility to the new fueling station.
SBE INVOLVEMENT
The SBE goal was advertised at 25%. Currently, Calahan Construction is performing at 47%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the project is included in the 2013 approved budget. The construction budget is
$4,905,403 with $495,452 being CDOT FASTER grant funding and $4,409,951 of local funding.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services

of the project.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. It is not recommended by the Operations and Customer
Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager’s contract
amendment signature authority for the Rio Court Maintenance-of-Way Renovation/Tenant Finish
Project be increased from $500,000 to $700,000. Alternatively, complete the project as is and rebid
all remaining pending work. This alternative would delay the project and present several challenges in
regards to warranties, construction permits, and the certificate-of-occupancy.

DRCOG Vanpool Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement
is for calendar year 2014 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $700,000.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.

DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
on marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.

Packet Pg. 128

11.I

RTD financial support is used to help to underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans in service grew from 11
to 107 vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an
average of 5.8 riders per van and the fleet is at 80% capacity.
DRCOG vanpool performance through the 3rd Quarter in 2013 resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger
trip of approximately $2.21. For comparison, the subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in
2012 ranged from an average of $2.85 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of
$6.66 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.23 subsidy per passenger
for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2014 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool service in order to continue
to provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area
who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

North Front Range Vanpool Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the North Front Range Metropolitan Planning Organization (NFRMPO) to provide RTD
support and continued expansion of the NFR VANGO vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area.
This agreement is for calendar year 2014 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $450,000.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.

DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool program since 2003. The program targets long
distance commuters who live in Northern Colorado and who travel to the Denver metropolitan area. Of
the vans in operation, 75% provide service in the RTD district. The RTD subsidy is based on vanpool
travel within the RTD district. The vanpool program had been limited by perceived high fares, insufficient
funding for van acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary
marketing activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the NFRMPO entered into a
partnership in 2003 to expand vanpool service coming into the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so,
RTD and NFRMPO believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting
shared goals of offering desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality
in the Denver metropolitan area. RTD financial support is used to help to underwrite the vanpool pricing
structure in order to make vanpool fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By
subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived
as a more attractive alternative for area commuters. In addition, RTD’s support is used to provide
incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling
stock to provide vanpool services. In return for this funding NFRMPO provides RTD with National
Transportation Data. This data is included in the NTD numbers reported by RTD and used by the Federal
Government to determine the amount of federal funding allocated to RTD. Since the advent of RTD
support for the vanpool program in late 2003, the number of vans serving the Denver metropolitan area
has grown from 28 to 54 vans.

Packet Pg. 131

RTD shall contribute funding to NFRMPO to support the provision of the VANGO vanpool service in an
amount not to exceed $450,000.00 in 2013. NFRMPO vanpool performance through the 3 rd Quarter in
2013 resulted in an RTD subsidy of approximately $4.24 per passenger trip. For comparison, the subsidy
per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2012 ranged from an average of $2.85 subsidy per
passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $6.66 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service
and an average of $5.23 subsidy per passenger for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool program are included in the approved 2014 RTD
budget. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of Northern Colorado who commute to
and work in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the VANGO vanpool program which would result in an
increase in single occupant commuting.

City of Boulder Hop Cost Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of
the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2014 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,484,378.00.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount
not to exceed $1,484,378.00 in 2014.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of
Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision
of HOP service through 3rd Quarter in 2013 resulted in 27.5 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy
per HOP passenger trip of $1.61. For comparison, the subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route
service in 2012 ranged from an average of $2.85 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an
average of $6.66 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.23 subsidy
per passenger for regional service.

5311 Cost Share Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County,
Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2014 and for amounts
not to exceed $343,680.00 for Boulder County, $338,250.00 for Adams County and $104,804.00 for
Jefferson County.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEALU), along with previous transit legislation, provided for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized,
or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addressed the provision of services in non-urbanized areas
was Section 5311 and thus these services were often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013,
SAFETEA-LU was replaced by new transportation authorizing legislation known as Moving Ahead for
Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private,
non-profit agencies to assist with the provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District
and to provide local match money for federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in
the District. RTD has provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in
Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized
service in Adams and Boulder Counties since 1993.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $343,680.00 in 2014. RTD shall also
contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams
County in amount not to exceed $338,250.00 in 2014.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $104,804.00 in 2014.
These Agreements will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of
the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of
the funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected
party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311
service thus far in 2013 (current numbers available) has resulted in monthly performance that has
ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from
approximately $2.15 to approximately $4.66 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a
comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly performance averaged 4.4 passengers per hour in 2012 while

Packet Pg. 135

11.L

RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at approximately 1.2 passengers per hour.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2014 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource
Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the
non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Subject:

Approval of Sales and Use Tax Compliance
Review Contractor

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to approve a two year contract with an additional one year option
with Revenue Recovery Group to provide sales and use tax compliance review services. The
contract will be paid on a labor hour basis with an annual not-to-exceed amount of $607,500.
BACKGROUND
Following the recommendations from staff and the RTD Fiscal Sustainability Committee, the Board of
Directors authorized the General Manager to pursue sales and use tax compliance reviews as a revenue
enhancement initiative. This initiative is also included as a Risk Allocation Matrix item. In September,
RTD completed negotiations and entered an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the Colorado
Department of Revenue (DOR) to allow RTD to issue a request for proposals (RFP) for a third party to
provide tax compliance review services to supplement the services currently performed by the DOR.
DISCUSSION
The DOR performs sales and use tax collection and compliance services for RTD’s 1.0% sales and use
tax. The DOR is spending an annual amount of $1.4 million to provide these services for RTD while RTD
is paying the DOR $0.5 million based on a statutory formula. RTD is looking to enhance its partnership
with the DOR to increase sales and use tax revenues through these supplementary compliance services.
Sales and use taxes comprise approximately two thirds of RTD’s annual revenues. Due to RTD’s
reliance on this substantial source of revenue to provide services and to service its debt, it is critical that
tax remittances are accurate and timely. To date, RTD has improved its sales and use tax forecasting by
contracting with the CU Leeds School of Business and has streamlined its tax base through legislation
establishing exemption parity with the state. With the issuance of the tax compliance review services
RFP, RTD is taking a further step towards completing its sales and use tax initiatives.
RTD received three proposals in response to this RFP. The proposal evaluation committee selected
Revenue Recovery Group (RRG) as the firm to be awarded this contract. Proposal selection criteria were
based on best value in providing an understanding of the scope of work, firm experience, personnel
experience and cost.
Services provided will be paid on a labor hour basis with an estimated 4,500 hours of service provided
annually. Potential engagements will be presented to RTD by RRG after a discovery period. RTD will
then approve the engagement, along with DOR’s concurrence, before fieldwork begins.
Each
engagement will be evaluated before approval to proceed is granted. Under the terms of the DOR IGA,
RRG may also perform compliance reviews for state and municipal sales and use taxes during the same
engagement to avoid multiple engagements for a single vendor.

Packet Pg. 137

12.M

While RTD expects that, overall, these services will result in additional tax revenues, it is also expected
that some engagements will result in refunds to vendors. A benefit of providing these services is also to
assist and educate vendors with the complexities of tax filing requirements with the primary goal being
to provide assurance that tax filing compliance is met.
In addition to tax compliance reviews, the scope of the services includes providing information and
reporting, to the extent permissible under state confidentiality regulations, to RTD for analysis.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
It is anticipated that the additional sales and use tax revenues recovered will significantly exceed the
cost of this service. The cost of these services has been included in the 2014 Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to approve a two year contract with an additional one year
option with Revenue Recovery Group to provide sales and use tax compliance review
services. The contract will be paid on a labor hour basis with an annual not-to-exceed amount
of $607,500.
2. Further modify the compliance review services contract. This is not recommended because it will
delay the implementation of these services which are constrained by a fixed term under the DOR
IGA.
3. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a two year contract with an additional one
year option with Revenue Recovery Group to provide sales and use tax compliance review
services. This is not the recommended action because RTD would not have the opportunity
to ensure greater tax compliance and enhance its tax reporting capabilities.

Approval of the Purchase of Four Electric
Multiple Units (EMU) Cars for the Eagle Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the purchase of four Electric Multiple Units
(EMU) cars for the Eagle Project through the Denver Transit Partners (DTP), for an amount not to
exceed $18 million.
It is further recommended by the Operations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to transfer $7.5 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to the Eagle
Project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU cars.
BACKGROUND
As part of the Eagle Project, RTD defined the minimum service requirements through year 2044 for
which DTP are responsible and DTP has demonstrated that the 50 EMU cars included in the
Concession are adequate to achieve those goals.
Subsequent analysis by staff has shown that some additional special event service to serve large
events in the region, as well as heavy travel days such as around Thanksgiving and others, would be
beneficial. In addition, while staff has conducted numerous and extensive planning analyses to
determine the anticipated operational requirements for the Eagle Project, these studies are not an
exact science and it is likely that operational needs over the years of operations will be somewhat
different from that anticipated. Having some additional EMU cars will provide the flexibility to allow
these revised needs to be met.
In order to achieve these goals for our customers, staff has determined that an additional four EMU
cars would be adequate to provide this additional capability, greatly enhancing the service RTD can
provide over the life of the EMU fleet.
DISCUSSION
As part of the North Metro project RTD is planning to purchase six additiona l EMU cars to facilitate
operation on the segment from DUS to 124 th Avenue as approved by the Board on November 26,
2013. During discussions with DTP, in order to purchase these EMU cars for the North Metro
project it has been established that the window of opportunity in the manufacturing process to
purchase any additional EMU cars technically consistent with the current fleet and at an acceptable
cost is rapidly closing. It has also become apparent during these discussions that increasing the
number of EMU cars that RTD purchases now will have a significant effect on the unit cost of each
of the EMU cars, resulting in a cost savings for the North Metro project.
We recommend purchasing four EMU cars through the Eagle Concession Agreement (CA) because
the price is reasonable, allows for interchangeable parts with the Eagle EMU fleet, and facilitates

Packet Pg. 139

12.N

improved special events service on the East Rail Line, the Gold Line, the Northwest Rail Line and the
North Metro Line.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the purchase of the four EMU cars would be provided through use of CMAQ monies
available to the Eagle Project and through the recommended transfer of $7.5 million from the
FasTracks Contingency Reserve. Staff will investigate additional funding sources to replenis h the
FasTracks Contingency Reserve at a future date.
Payment for each EMU car shall be made by RTD to the Concessionaire consistent with the payment
schedule provided in CA Section 31.1(i).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the
purchase of four Electric Multiple Units (EMU) cars for the Eagle Project through the Denver
Transit Partners (DTP), for an amount not to exceed $18 million.
It is further recommended by the Operations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to transfer $7.5 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve
to the Eagle Project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU cars.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Remain with the current fleet and accept reduced
capacity to serve special events, reduced flexibility to meet needs that may develop in the future
and pay a premium for any future small order size for North Metro project.

Englewood Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2014 and is for
an amount not to exceed $282,000.00.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was a free service. In September 2007, with the
expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood
continues the management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing
and related expenses. The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of
Englewood. The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art
shuttle charged a RTD fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 828.3 boardings per day or 30.9 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $282,000 in 2014.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through 3rd Quarter in 2013 resulted in 30.9 passengers per hour and
an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.30. For comparison, the subsidy per passenger for
RTD fixed route service in 2012 ranged from an average of $2.85 subsidy per passenger for CBD local
routes to an average of $6.66 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.23
subsidy per passenger for regional service. The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the
art shuttle.

Packet Pg. 141

12.O

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2014 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Englewood for the art shuttle circulator bus
service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the art shuttle circulator service.
