that the committee can be called back to order and work through the day's agenda.
I will now entertain a motion to discuss the following. Executive Session pursuant to Section 24-6402(4)(f)(I) CRS for consideration of personal matters regarding interviews of candidate finalists for
Executive Manager, Board Office Recruitment. Do we have a mover and a second?
PEGGY CATLIN: So moved.
LYNN GUSSINGER: I heard Catlin mover and Sloan as second. Is there any discussion? Anyone
opposed to the motion? All right. I see that Director Dishell has joined us, and we are now ready to
adjourn this meeting to the Executive Session as of 11:18. All those entitled to participate in the Executive
Session, please move to the other room. Thanks, I'll see you over there.

week, Melanie. Guess you're back, huh?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yeah.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Good. OK, let's see. We have everyone-- Debra's not here yet. And I think I could
probably-- I guess-- I know she's in transit. I guess she will let know, Tai-Shrae, if she's missing the
information. We'll give it a couple of minutes and then we got some introductory stuff, the public comment
and stuff, but we'll-- maybe I'll text her.
Oh, there she is. OK. All right. I would like to call the Executive Committee back-- meeting back to order.
It is 12:37 PM. I'd like to open public comment to anyone who would like to address the committee
regarding any topic listed in the published meeting agenda for the current and immediately preceding
month. If you wish to speak and have not already done so, please either raise your virtual hand or press
star-9 on your phone. Are there any hands raised for public comment?
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: No, there's no hand-raised and no emails.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. Thanks. Then we will close the public comment at this point. All right. We have
two recommended actions on the agenda today. Item A was mistakenly listed. We're going to move that
to the-- it's the Bylaws Amendment Director Informal Meeting Process. We're going to move that
discussion to the agenda discussion of the Board meeting.
It was originally presented at the September 2022 Board meeting and reintroduced in October, and was
postponed to the April 2023 Board meeting. So it will be considered there.
Our first action is the Zero Emission Policy. The-- this first recommended action. The Regional
Transportation District, RTD, under the General Manager and CEO's leadership shall achieve net zero

emissions by 20-blank-- I thought we had filled that in with 2050-- as measured by scope 1 and scope 2
emissions as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
RTD's Board shall reevaluate this policy after receiving an asset transition plan or similarly named plan
which details RTD's plans to transition to a zero-emission fleet, and no less than annually to measure
progress towards this policy.
In the event working toward this policy is in conflict with RTD's ability to deliver service, staff shall bring a
recommended action to the Board to weigh the options against this policy and to determine whether
adjustment is necessary. Bobby, I'm not sure-BOBBY DISHELL: Yeah. I think-LYNN GUSSINGER: We have-- right.
BOBBY DISHELL: Oh. Does someone need to second it first or are we-LYNN GUSSINGER: Well, we can go ahead and take a motion. Do we have a motion and the second?
BOBBY DISHELL: I'll move it.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Second? We have a second?
ERIK DAVIDSON: Second.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. Thanks. We got Dishell as the movement and Davidson as the second. Go
ahead, Bobby.
BOBBY DISHELL: I move to amend this motion to include the read language that was previously
distributed and included in the April 12 Operations and Safety Committee packet, which was not included
in this packet, but that is my amendment. I don't know, Melanie, that's procedurally kosher.
MELANIE SNYDER: You can read it into the record. Tai-Shrae, I don't know if you have that handy, that
would be helpful to read it into the record so that we're clear on what the amendment is.
LYNN GUSSINGER: If you need to, we can come back to this.
BOBBY DISHELL: Yeah, if we could do the next one first, and I'll find the language. So I move the table
until after the Board discussion of the recommended action related to the Termination of Contract for
Battery Electric Buses with New Flyer of America Inc.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK, that actually is not a discussion on this. It's-- the New Flyer Buses
recommended action is-- it's actually under unanimous consent, we may want to move it. But that's just
part of approving the Board meeting agenda. So we can move on to the April Board meeting agenda
review and come back to this recommended action, can't we, Melanie?
MELANIE SNYDER: It might be cleaner since you're trying to-- I think it would be easier because you
want to have the recommended action included on the agenda.
LYNN GUSSINGER: True. OK.

BOBBY DISHELL: All right. Everyone, bear with me.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Yep. Great. Wanna read it into the record?
BOBBY DISHELL: Yes. I move to amend the language of the recommended action such that it reads as
follows in its entirety. The Regional Transportation District, open paren, RTD, closed paren, comma,
under the General Manager and CEO's leadership shall achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as
measured by scope 1 and 2 emissions as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
RTD's Board shall reevaluate this policy after receiving an asset transition plan, open paren, or similarlynamed plan, which details RTD's plans to transition to a zero-emission fleet, close paren. Open paren,
transition a plan-defined term, close paren, and no less than annually to measure progress towards this
policy.
Staff shall exercise best efforts to deliver the transition plan to the November 2023 operations-convention-- Operations and Safety Committee meeting. In the event the transition plant is not ready prior
to the November 2023 Operations and Safety Committee meeting, staff shall present monthly updates to
the Board of Directors until such time as the transition plan can be completed.
In the event including scope 2 emissions will delay the completion of the transition plan, staff shall apprise
the Board of Directors at the same and the Board of Directors may elect to remove scope 2 emissions
portion from the transition plan. In the event working towards this policy is in conflict with our RTD's ability
to deliver service, staff shall bring a recommended action to the Board to weigh the options against this
policy and to determine whether adjustment is necessary.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Great. We have a motion to amend the recommended action as read. Do we have a
second?
ERIK DAVIDSON: Second.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. Motion from Director Dishell, second from Director Davidson. Is there additional
discussion? Bobby, you want to explain? I see Debra's hand up. go ahead.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes. Thank you very kindly, Madam Chair. I just had a quick question. Recognizing
that on the agenda, we have the facilities and fleet transition plan, and recognizing the timeline that's
outlined, pursuant to the language that was read into the record as an amendment by Director Dishell, is
it still germane to say that there will be a plan readily available in November of 2023 as opposed to just
merely saying that staff will provide updates on the status of said transition plan?
BOBBY DISHELL: I'm not opposed to that, to striking that second paragraph and changing it to, "Staff
shall provide monthly updates to the Board of Directors beginning in November-- on the transition plan
beginning in November 2023."
DEBRA JOHNSON: OK. Thank you very kindly, Madam Chair. That's all I had.
LYNN GUSSINGER: I guess I would be interested to have monthly updates before November-BOBBY DISHELL: We can start now.

LYNN GUSSINGER: Yeah. So we know how the process is going. Doesn't have to take much time. It
could just be part of your Chair's report or something.
DEBRA JOHNSON: So Madam Chair, I would say, then change the language to say, upon a notice to
proceed to be issued, because it's all contingent upon us having a consultancy that's on board. And if
we're in the midst of an act of procurement, I can't speak in public session about that due to the blackout
period adhering to our procurement protocols.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. I'm also OK leaving it as November and people can ask you or you can give us
an update during your Chair's report if others are OK with that-- before that it's things go along.
BOBBY DISHELL: I think that means I have to read it again, right? Yes.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Yeah.
BOBBY DISHELL: I withdraw all my prior motion procedurally, right? I withdraw my prior amendment and
make a new one.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Mm-hmm.
BOBBY DISHELL: Great.
MELANIE SNYDER: As long as Director Sloan's OK with that. She seconded it. Or pardon me, that was
Director Davidson that seconded this.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yes, go ahead.
BOBBY DISHELL: Before I do, Ms. Johnson, I see your hand is still up.
LYNN GUSSINGER: [INAUDIBLE] I will take it through.
BOBBY DISHELL: [INAUDIBLE]. OK. A move to amend the recommended action so that it reads as
follows. The Regional Transportation District, RTD, under General Manager and CEO's leadership shall
achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as measured by scope 1 and 2 emissions as defined by the
Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
Our Board shall reevaluate this policy after receiving an asset transition plan or similarly-named plan
which details RTD's transition plan to a zero-emission fleet transition plan, and no less than annually to
measure progress towards this policy.
Beginning with the November 2023 Operations and Safety Committee meeting, staff shall present a-staff shall present a monthly report on the transition of the plan. In the event including scope 2 emissions
will delay the completion of the transition plan, staff shall apprise the Board of Directors of the same and
the Board of Directors may elect to remove the scope 2 emissions portion of the transition plan.
In the event working towards this policy is in conflict with RTD's ability to deliver service, staff shall bring a
recommended action to the Board to weigh the options against this policy and to determine whether
adjustment is necessary.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. Do you still second this motion, Director Davidson?

ERIK DAVIDSON: Yes, I do.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Great. Thanks. OK. OK. Let's see. Are there-- is there any further discussion? All
right. Are there any no votes on this action? With five yes votes and zero no votes, the motion passes.
Great. April Board meeting agenda review. Is there a motion-PEGGY CATLIN: Chair, Madam Chair, we just voted on the amendment.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Oh, thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: --didn't vote on the whole-LYNN GUSSINGER: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: --action item.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Great. Do we have a motion-- did we get a motion already on? We did.
MELANIE SNYDER: We have a motion and a second. You just to call for the vote on the main motion.
LYNN GUSSINGER: All right. Calling for the vote on the main motion. Are there any no votes on the main
motion on this action?
PEGGY CATLIN: I have a comment. We haven't had a discussion yet. I'm not going to be very popular
here, but I had a long discussion last night at a Conifer town hall where a director of CORE, which is the
Colorado Rural Electric Association, we had a discussion about transition plans and the fleet and
everything.
And he was very pragmatic and was familiar, actually, with this proposed action. And was questioning the
practicality of achieving this.
Now I appreciate the qualifiers that Director Dishell put forward in his motion to amend, but I am
concerned not necessarily about-- I like the qualifier about should it impact RTD's ability to deliver service,
but I would be more comfortable with something that talked about cost-effectiveness of our policy.
And I think maybe the annual review and the monthly reporting could probably cover that, and it gives the
Board the ability to modify and to change this policy. But I just wanted to state that for the record that we
don't have anything in there that talks about the cost-effectiveness other than tangentially, perhaps, the
ability to deliver service.
If we're going to spend a lot of money to make this transition plan to the extent that it does compromise
our ability to deliver service, I just might have some concerns about that. This gentleman that I talked to,
the Director of CORE, was cautioning me about the fact that we are completely at the mercy of public
service and we don't have anyone else that-- and that it could be very costly for the agency.
So I just wanted to state for the record that I do have some concerns about this. Leading edge,
admittedly, that when you gave the other agencies plans, that we do want to be leading edge on this.
But I also know that there's quite a bit of research on some of the other components of scope 1 and
scope 2 emissions, and I am very mindful of some of the changing science. And just I just want to keep

that in the back of our minds. I just don't want to go blindly or blithely toward this policy without really
giving it all of those considerations.
And I don't want to in any way diminish the work that the Ad Hoc Committee has done. It's really great
work. But we're hanging our hat on the Paris Climate Change Accord, and I think there are some other
studies out there that we may want to at least take a look at to be well-informed.
BOBBY DISHELL: Can you say what those are?
PEGGY CATLIN: Actually, no, but I have some calls in. I don't know if you-- and I'm not prepared yet.
That's why I-BOBBY DISHELL: Got it.
PEGGY CATLIN: But I spent eight years on the Standing Committee of the Academy of Sciences
Transportation Research Board, and I know there's a lot of information that I would personally like to
pursue. And I don't think it should impede the ability for us to move forward right now. I just want to make
sure we have enough wiggle room or latitude that we can make adjustments as we go forward. So sorry.
BOBBY DISHELL: No, [INAUDIBLE]
PEGGY CATLIN: [INAUDIBLE] sorry. Thank you.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Yeah. Other discussion, Erik?
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yeah. I just wanted to react to that. So thank you, Director Catlin, for bringing that up. I
do think that given-- there's a challenge here that as we've move to-- move towards zero emissions and a
full transition, there's a lot of things that are going to be very new here. And I just wanted to offer for the
group that I think some of your questions are valid considerations about how we rectify all of this against
financial policy.
And it may be there's actually some great resources out there that I'd be happy to share offline. Just that
there are some gaps in terms of holistic approaches in marrying what financial policy looks like in the
absence of financial modeling of the cost of emissions and environmental impact and extraction of
different types of fuels.
So I think this is where, A, it's important that we don't overspecify exact fuel types over the course of the
transition, and that we move forward with a transition plan. And I would just offer up to the group that it
may be, over the next year, two, three, four years, even, we'll need to do some work on the financial side
of things to frame our policy to be in alignment with our fiduciary responsibility as well as changing
economic models and conditions for the costs of various fuel types and the transition.
Also, there will be-- I think this will change as political winds change, but there will be various funding
opportunities that are attached to transition. So it's also a consideration in terms of what our policy is.
So a long-winded way of saying, I support moving forward this now. I think Director Catlin, you identify
some questions that we collectively have across agencies, across businesses, across states, across
countries. And we'll probably need to be prepared to react with formal financial policy and perhaps other
policies to remain in alignment with our mission and with the transition plan.

LYNN GUSSINGER: Great, thanks. Any other discussion? Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Yeah. And Director Catlin, I only ask like what studies are there because all the
studies I get in my day job are yeah, 2050 is the year, this decade is the most crucial, and that's what's
out there. So if there is new data and new science, I think it's important that we're taking it into
consideration, which is why I think it's so-- that annual evaluation is so critical.
And I can certainly commit to at least, while I'm here for what would be the second-- or the first annual
evaluation, working on building out, what are we looking at? Who are we talking to? What do we need to
take into account? Because as Director Davidson said, there's all sorts of headwinds, direct pay being
one of the big ones.
That municipalities and, I don't know, state agencies and others are able to do in order to leverage tax
credits. It opens a whole different world of P3 that no one, to be honest, really has a good answer on.
Most people are still waiting on IRS guidance.
But it is there's certainly a lot of other letters. But I do think it's critical that we are getting new updated,
always checking what's best, what is the climate science say? Are we working towards reducing carbon?
Because that's the-- right? To reduce carbon emission.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Director Catlin, First Vice Chair.
PEGGY CATLIN: I want to thank you-- both you and Director Davidson for that flexibility. And I just-- like I
said, I just wanted to go on the record to erase some of these concerns, and I will continue my dialogue
with this Director of CORE, because he's an electrical engineer by degree, has his own company, and
just really wants to look at a pragmatic approach. And I just felt I needed to bring it up.
I'm no expert, and I know, Director Dishell, that you and your committee have done a lot of work toward
this goal, s I just wanted to provide some cautionary words. So thank you for being flexible.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Thank you. Thank you for raising it. Thank you, all of us. I think we understand and
share the concerns. All right, are there any no votes on this action? All right. The vote-- the recommended
action is approved with five yes votes and zero no votes. Thank you very much.
Now we're going to look at the April Board meeting agenda review. I think there are some amendments,
but first, I'm going to start with a motion to move the April Board agenda to the Board meeting on April 23.
Need a motion and a second. Did we get a motion?
BOBBY DISHELL: Oh. So moved.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Second?
MARJORIE SLOAN: Second.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. I hear Director Dishell and Director Sloan Here. Marjorie, I know you have an
amendment. I think Erik has to leave, so I'm going to go to him real quick first.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yeah, thank you, Chair. I'd just like to apologize to my colleagues in the Executive
Committee here. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I do need to leave the meeting, but thank you
very much for the understanding.

LYNN GUSSINGER: Thank you, yeah. Let's see. Marjorie, I think you were next. So, we have a motion
and a second. Is there any discussion on this? And Marjorie, you go ahead. Probably you're muted, I
think.
MARJORIE SLOAN: I got my hand up but didn't unmute. Yeah. I would move to withdraw the informal
meetings bylaws amendment from the Board April 25 agenda. Do we need a second? And then I will
explain the reasoning behind that.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK, great. Do we have a second on that motion?
BOBBY DISHELL: Second.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK, I have-MELANIE SNYDER: Pardon me, Madam Chair. So if I'm just thinking about the procedure. So that
matter's already on the agenda for the Board meeting. So I think the more appropriate time to make that
motion would be at the Board meeting. It's not-LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. Not appropriate. Even though we're approving the agenda here?
MELANIE SNYDER: So are you making a motion to postpone it to another date certain? Because it's
already-- or are you making a motion to remove it for separate consideration and discussion?
MARJORIE SLOAN: Remove it and for later consideration and discussion of the entire subject of informal
meetings, and both the other two requesting Board members are here and I believe they would confirm
that they're also willing to withdraw that request.
MELANIE SNYDER: OK. So I think, then, if I'm understanding you correctly, then I think the motion is to
postpone it to another-- pick a date certain that the Board would take that up? Or are you-- maybe-- I
apologize if I'm not understanding you.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Yeah. I understand you were in-- out of the loop during a recent flurry about this
proposal. Would it help if I would explain the reasoning behind this and then you could give us your
advice on how to deal with it on the agenda?
MELANIE SNYDER: Sure.
MARJORIE SLOAN: OK. I'll start. As you probably are all tired of hearing, the intent of this proposal was
to facilitate more effective governance by allowing Board meetings to have informal meetings on topics
that they were interested in or geographic areas that they were interested in and could set the location.
And yet still comply with the Open Meetings Act.
So there were three purposes behind this. One, efficiency and flexibility; two, transparency; and three,
complying with the Open Meetings Act. It's my personal belief that efficiency and transparency would still
support the informal meetings proposal.
However, recently, we have heard of another interpretation of the Open Meetings Act. And I believe,
Melanie, you were on vacation and out of the office. And that was that Board members were free to have
informal meetings, meetings that met the definition of a meeting under the Open Meetings Act, but did not
require notice under the Open Meetings Act.

So that this provision actually hampered anyone who wanted to have a meeting that was public, but was
lacking in notice to anyone-- other Board members or to the public.
So it's my feeling that if we want to pursue this more efficient way of having smaller informal meetings, we
need to have another interpretation by you of the Open Meetings Act and the notice requirement and then
follow it up with a Board discussion of what we want our Board custom to be.
If it's going beyond the notice requirements of the Open Meeting Act in the interest of transparency, the
Board would certainly be free to do that, but it would require some discussion. So with this controversy
that has arisen, I'm certain that this proposal is not ready for Board consideration at this point.
LYNN GUSSINGER: So I guess the question we're looking at now is-- I think that was a good summary,
and I think we feel like a discussion to make sure everybody understands the Open Meetings law is
probably our next step. So if the motion is to withdraw this and not to table it, Melanie, do we approve this
as an agenda item and do that at the Board meeting? Is that what you're saying?
BOBBY DISHELL: Or is it procedurally easier for me to just-- for any-- or all three of us to say, I'm
withdrawing my signature, I'm no longer signed on to bringing forward a director-recommended action
that procedurally it can't go if you don't have three?
MELANIE SNYDER: I think-- hearing the conversation, it sounds like you're not asking for it to be
postponed, you're asking for it to be withdrawn and all of the directors that were originally in support of
this through director-initiated action have now withdrawn their support. So I think it is proper for the
motion-- it's proper to make the motion to withdraw that from consideration.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Great. All right. Did we get a second on that? I think Bobby-- I think the Dishell was
the second on that. OK. Do we have any no votes on-- Bobby, did you have more to say?
BOBBY DISHELL: No, sorry, this is for a different amendment to the agenda.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. I'm sorry. And is there other discussion? Director Ruscha?
JOYANN RUSCHA: On the procedural question, because we are-- it sounds like that the three directors
are essentially asking to kill their own resolution, I wonder because a previous Board meeting had already
acted on it to table it, does the Executive Committee have the authority to not put it on the agenda
because it was already voted on by a whole board?
And I wonder-- and I don't-- I wouldn't die on this hill, I'm just putting it out there, if it might be better for it
just to go to the Board and then just explain that you're asking for a no-vote for the purpose of going back
to the drawing board. So that way, it reconciles what you're asking for procedurally as well as our bylaws
and previous Board action. But again, I just wanted-- it was just a thought.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK, thanks. I would be inclined to go back to Ms. Snyder. Doug, did you have
something you wanted to add to this before that?
DOUG TISDALE: If I may, Madam Chair, procedurally, I think, number one because the three directors
have withdrawn their support, it is appropriate to withdraw the item from the agenda, and that the
Executive Committee can sanction that. Secondly, in terms of the prior Board action, I believe the only
prior Board action was to postpone to a future date, and that action is rendered null by virtue of this
withdrawal.

That having been said, if counsel is concerned about having the Executive Committee taking the action to
withdraw, then when the meeting is called and this matter is brought up, there could simply be a motion to
table. People often confuse table versus postpone.
Table is to lay on the table, and that means it is not an action that would be taken up by the Board when
it's tabled, it's tabled. That's effective killing of the bill. So we could, if counsel feels it's required, go
through this exercise at the time, but I think it need not take much time.
And I also submit that given the procedural posture, the Executive Committee actually has the authority at
this point in time to allow the withdrawal and remove the item from the agenda. Thank you very much,
Madam Chair.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Thank you. Marjorie, do you want to say something before we go back to Melanie?
MARJORIE SLOAN: Yes, because this is directed toward our general counsel. And I've said, no, I don't
want consideration of this particular proposal, but I do believe a prompt legal opinion on the validity of
informal meetings of smaller groups of the Board without notice to the Board or the public would be more
than desirable to have an opinion on that provided to the Board.
LYNN GUSSINGER: And I'll broaden that to say to really to help the Board understand what the Open
Meetings law-- when the Open Meetings law is triggered. There's some case law and some limits on
when it's triggered, I think, that are worth getting the Board's understanding and having some thought and
discussion. So Ms. Snyder?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes, Chair, I'm always happy to provide a legal opinion to the Board. It probably
would be helpful to get a little bit more clarity on where you're feeling like there's a disconnect so I can
make sure I'm addressing the question that's being asked.
LYNN GUSSINGER: We can do that, yeah. I don't know that we need to do that here. I mean, I think
there's some legislative services, FAQ and documents that-- it's mostly-- in my opinion, Marjorie, you can
change that-- getting that information to the Board and giving the Board what is the law and what do we
need to do if we want to do something different.
We can do more-- in other words, we can do more detail with the legislative services documents offline if
everybody's OK with that. So, back to our question. Do we decide this today or do we take this to the
Board? You've heard all the arguments.
MELANIE SNYDER: Yeah, and I agree with Director Tisdale. I think there's authority right now. You have
a motion and a second to withdraw this recommended action, and I think the Executive Committee could
vote on that and remove it from the agenda.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. We have had a bit of a problem in the past when we made a change that some
of the directors didn't appreciate, but in this one, if we don't have three directors wanting to move it
forward, I don't know how you move it forward. So any further discussion before we have a vote on the
motion to withdraw this? I don't know if you want to restate your motion. Is it just to withdraw this
recommended action, Marjorie?
MARJORIE SLOAN: Exactly, from the agenda.

LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. We have a motion and a second. Seeing no further discussion, are there any
no votes? All right. Dr. Davidson had to leave. We have four yeses and zero no votes. Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Yeah, I moved to amend the agenda to add item 20 to label the current Executive
session as 20A you to add an Executive session as 20B. Executive session pursuant to Section 24-6402(4)(f). Plus, everyone's going to start shaking their heads. One, CRS for consideration of personnel
matters regarding interviews of candidate finalists for Executive Manager Board Office Recruitment.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK.
BOBBY DISHELL: My understanding was that that is what is desired by this group.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Yep.
BOBBY DISHELL: Based on earlier discussions.
LYNN GUSSINGER: And I think there's another amendment to the Executive session that we're going to
make as well.
PEGGY CATLIN: I second that.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. Any discussion on that amendment? Any no votes? All right. With a vote of 4 to
0 with Director Davidson absent, we will have that Executive session to the agenda.
I have another Executive session to add. Are there any other amendments to be proposed before I do
that? All right. I received this from Tai-Shrae and talked with Ms. Johnson about it a little bit before the
meeting, but Safety and Security would like to provide the Board with some security arrangements during
Tuesday's Board meeting.
CRS 24-6-402(4)(d), Specialized Details of Security Arrangements or Investigations, Including Defenses
Against Terrorism, Both Domestic and Foreign, and including where disclosure of the matters discussed
might reveal information that could be used for the purpose of committing or avoiding prosecution for or-pardon me-- a violation of the law. Is there a motion to add this Executive session? Yeah, Ms. Snyder?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes, Chair, thank you. I didn't have a chance to get back to Tai-Shrae. If we could, I
would work-- can I make the recommendation that I would work with staff to get the correct language that
would meet the Open Meetings law in the agenda?
But my understanding that the purpose of this Executive session would be under the correct basis the
statutory basis you notice, but this is related to active shooter training. So we just need to get that
language updated and I can work with Board staff to do that.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Is there a motion to add the Executive session to deal with-- we will have the exact
language once Ms. Snyder works with the Board Office, but to deal with active shooter training.
MARJORIE SLOAN: So moved.
LYNN GUSSINGER: And a second?
PEGGY CATLIN: I'll second.

LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. I hear Director Sloan and Director Catlin as the motion-- as the movement and
the second. Any discussion on this item? All right. Are there any no votes? The motion passes with four
votes. Director Davidson is no longer with us.
And I don't know if this is an amendment, but I would like to see the three-- I'm going back to my agenda.
The three unanimous consent items, those seem to me to be items that are worthy of being on
recommended action. I don't think they need a big discussion. I've talked with Ms. Johnson about this.
Is the holistic low/no -emission facilities and fleet transition plan scope of work summary approval and
contract authorization, the termination of contract for battery electric buses with New Flyer of America.
And I guess the third one was the informal meeting. So it's just those two. I think any director can ask to
pull those into recommended action. So I am asking that at this point. It seems worthy of having the
availability of discussion by Board members. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. You're quite correct, that any director can ask that
an item be removed, and I think just for the sake of order, they came through as unanimous consent
items. And I think, therefore, it would be more appropriate to have them remain on the agenda as
unanimous consent items and then be removed to recommended action that the time of the meeting. And
any director can do that.
But I think it sends perhaps the wrong message if the Executive Committee unilaterally does that in
advance of the meeting when the matters did arise through the committee process as unanimous consent
items. That's my observation. Thank you.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Did they come up as unanimous consent items? Did they say-DOUG TISDALE: I think they were approved unanimously. That's the only way they can get on the
unanimous consent agenda, is they have to have come through the committee as a unanimous item.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. Julian, I'm going to skip over and see if Ms. Johnson has something to say on
that before I-DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. I don't know if you can hear me. I'm actually in transit
on our system.
LYNN GUSSINGER: We can.
DEBRA JOHNSON: OK. So yes, In reference to what Director Tisdale offered up, that's exactly what I
was sharing with you, that they had come through committee on unanimous consent, and I was posing
that same question relative to the removal by Executive Committee. So I just wanted to reiterate that point
as well, so thank you.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. Sorry if I misunderstood that. I will raise that at the Board meeting unless
somebody else does. So we will leave it as is for now. Ms. Ruscha, Director Ruscha.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you. I actually-- I was just going to say that I agreed with Director Tisdale's
logic and that was the same logic I was applying to our previous discussion item. So we had the maybe
same premise, different conclusion the first time, but I think that Director Tisdale is correct in the
procedure.

LYNN GUSSINGER: Thank you. We've got it taken care of. We'll-- let's see. Back to the motion to move
the April Board agenda to the Board meeting on April 23 as amended. I guess we need to know that we
do-- do we have a motion to approve it as amended or did the previous movements want to make that
motion?
BOBBY DISHELL: So moved.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Director Dishell. is there a second?
MARJORIE SLOAN: Second.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Director Sloan. All right. Are there any no votes? All right. First, are there any further
discussion? Are there any no votes? OK. It moves forward with four yes votes, zero no votes, and
Director Davidson not present. All right. We're now to the discussion item portion of the agenda, and there
are two items for today. Our first item is the March 2023 Government Relations Report. Michael Davies, if
you would please.
MICHAEL DAVIES: Yes. Hello, Chair, representatives of the committee. I have a very brief Government
Relations Report. Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer. Very brief Government Relations
Report for you. The federal level, not a lot going on except for the appropriations committees are doing-starting to do their work with developing their own appropriations bills.
Secretary Buttigeg was before the House Transportation, Housing and Urban Development
Appropriations Committee earlier today testifying on the White House's budget.
At the state level, tracking House Bill 23-1101, that did clear the Senate with its Amendment that was
adopted in the Conference Committee that really had to do with a CDOT issue. And so they found
agreement on the compromise language and allowed that bill to move forward in the Senate. It's on the
house agenda today and hopefully complete and moved through the house and then that will send it to
the Governor's desk and hopefully that's done by tomorrow.
And then the local level, we have continued to do work and outreach to local councils, and just wanted to
report, as noticed in the written report joined by Director Buzek and General Manager Johnson, went and
presented at the North Glen City Council, and then also joined by Director Sloan, went and presented at
the Edgewater City Council.
And we have a few more of those not in May, but I believe in June with two more city councils that we're
working on to schedule at this time. And that does it for my report. Happy to answer your questions.
Thank you.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Were there questions? Director Ruscha.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Madam Chair. I noticed yesterday or the day before that
Congresswoman DeGette had announced that she had advanced our request for federal money in
congressionally directed spending I think for Central Corridor Maintenance and Repairs. And I was just
wondering, Mr. Davies, if you could maybe remind us or me if there were any other members of our
congressional delegation who are also advocating for additional dollars beyond that in the CDS process.
MICHAEL DAVIES: In the CDS process, that is the project that RTD put forward in terms of a viable
project that meets within the framework of the CDS spending program. But yes, you're correct,

Congresswoman DeGette. And she advanced a project for us in this same program last year and was
successful at getting this funding for RTD in that.
And so this year in the same process, RTD submitted an extension, essentially, to that same project to
seek a little more federal assistance. And she did support that. There's still quite a ways to go before
that's adopted into appropriations bills and into a final bill, but that same request was also made to both of
our senators, which, of course, have a different process over on the Senate side than the House side.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Great. Anything further?
JOYANN RUSCHA: No. Thank you for that update and hats off to the team for working through that, and
it was a long process.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Yeah. It was great. OK. Anything further for Mr. Davies? Thanks so much, Mike.
Second one-- second discussion item is update to the Board Expense and Travel Policy. The staff has
moved to a per diem expense policy, so you don't have to turn in and keep track of all of your receipts.
And it's defined-- there's a sheet of what the per diem is in cities around the country that's federally
defined. My understanding is that's what we're following. And it's a discussion item now, but my proposal
is that we bring the Board into compliance-- into synergy with what the staff is doing and just go with a per
diem for our travel. Director Dishell?
BOBBY DISHELL: Yeah. I get that it's easier, but I think that we owe it to the taxpayers to let them know
when we're spending their money for our personal travel or taking people out for local expenses where
that money is being spent and how it's being spent. I just-- I have a hard time getting behind a per diem
policy for publicly-elected officials.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Well, it wouldn't be a per diem for local expenses. You're taking someone out for
local, and it wouldn't be personal travel. It would be when you're doing RTD business.
BOBBY DISHELL: Yeah. Maybe it's a full Board discussion. I'd be hard-pressed to understand why we
would take that away from taxpayers being able to see how we're spending their money.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. I think it's a full Board discussion, so at this point, I'm just suggesting it. I think
it's something that all the staff has gone to and it simplifies the processes. Any other comments? I'm not
proposing it at this point. I would bring it back later for discussion. Director Ruscha?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Madam Chair. I think there is also an equity consideration when we are
talking about local versus long-distance travel. And perhaps there is a way to address both the points that
the Chair brought up and the concern that the Director Dishell had in just-- in the way that we do our long
distance travel budgeting process. But I-- so I just I just wanted to bring that up. I think that those two
things could be harmonized for whatever it's worth.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. We can talk about that unless you have some specific suggestions at this point.
It's not local-- it doesn't affect our local budget.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Right. So I guess I don't-- and I wasn't prepared to speak on this, so maybe this is a
later discussion. But I would just say like for example, if you look at our current budget for travel, the nonlocal, that permits a director to attend maybe-- if you try to attend more than one conference, you're

probably going to incur personal expenses. And so I wonder if that-- it's reasonable to take a look at that
and increase that budget.
And that would, I think, address some of the equity concern. And then that would still also provide that
transparency that Director Dishell was looking for. But again, I agree, this probably is just worth a greater
Board discussion, and I'll defer to this body on how that's framed.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. And I'm not asking anybody to frame it at this point. I'm just-- I appreciate the
conversation. That's why I'm putting it out there, is to hear what other people's views are. Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Yeah. I think maybe what Director Ruscha raised which piques my interest. Is maybe
it's per diem like for administrative ease at a per diem, but in order to get it, you have to produce a signed
affidavit under oath or something to that effect which details the way you spend the money. That gets you
the public transparency while also removing the administrative burden. There's also-- I just also don't love
the idea of paying people for expenses they didn't incur.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. I think I'll explore it more and we can discuss it more, but my inclination is to
bring something back at some point and see what the Board says. Any other discussion? All right. Are
there any other matters? Do you have your hand up again, Director Dishell? OK.
BOBBY DISHELL: Yeah. I have one other matter, which is, as we've gone back to meeting in-person, it's
awesome, it's wonderful to see people, and hopefully Director Catlin, we will see you soon. Maybe not
this one, but the next one.
I know that there was a legacy policy of providing dinner for Board members and buying bottled water and
buying snacks. And I just-- we're all adults. I just don't think it's the right use of public dollars to feed
ourselves salmon Caesar salad.
If we want to pass the hat and say, look, we want to provide dinner for ourselves, it's important culturally
for us to break bread together and we want to spend our own money to do it, I think that's fine. But I just-it really doesn't sit well with me that that's how we're choosing to spend that money, and it also places this
odd onus to show up for that dinner when you just might not be able to.
And so I would really like us to look at-- I don't know if it's a Board action or if it's at the Board Office, but it
just doesn't feel great. Also environmentally, I don't buy bottles of water, but that's a slightly different
concern than the monetary one because those are a pretty low-dollar item.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Director Dishell-- I mean Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I thought we actually had already addressed this
when the lockdown occurred-- just prior to the lockdown, and we said that meals-- and it was part of our
budget reconciliation when we slashed all of our travel budget and so forth and said that meals were to be
charged to your local expense account. So that, in fact, it wasn't just a broad, yeah, we're going to pay for
your dinner. No, it was charged to your local expense account.
And I think that's the way the rules still read. I don't know, and I see Tai-Shrae has her hand up and she
would be far more informed on this than I. Thank you.

LYNN GUSSINGER: No, I think that's correct, we can get Ms. Parish and Ms. Ruscha's comments. I think
temporarily we're suspending that. We're not doing dinner in the short-term for other reasons. But let's-I've got a couple more comments. Let's go ahead and hear-- Tai-Shrae, did you have something to-TAI-SHRAE PARISH: Yeah, I just wanted to clarify for Director Tisdale. There was a resolution, but it was
for one year only, and it was only to charge back the director's $10. So it wasn't the full cost of the meal.
And because of COVID, a lot of caterers have upped their costs. There's additional administrative fees. I
can't provide a buffet like I used to. Everything has to be individually packaged just to limit the passing of
germs and whatnot.
So it is more expensive today to cater than it used to be, but again, that resolution was just one time for
one year and it was only $10. So the full cost of the meal was never attributed to the directors.
LYNN GUSSINGER: Great, thanks. Ms. Ruscha, I see you took your hand down, so I assume nothing to
add there. So again-- let me know if you do, Director Ruscha. Again, it's not happening right now. I would
say that I agree, it should come out of our local expense account and it should be the actual cost, and
then if people don't want to do that, they wouldn't do it.
I personally think that it was very helpful to be able to do that. We're just getting to know each other
because we haven't been in person for a long time. And it's having the tradition of being able to sit down
for a half hour or 45 minutes beforehand where we're not discussing business was a helpful way to go.
And I think it's a very standard way to go in local governments. People are getting off work, we're getting
ready to start a four-hour or more or less meeting. So having people be fed, I think, has a lot of value. But
for now, it's not happening. All right, Director Ruscha.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Thank you, Madam Chair. So on the one hand, I agree with Director Dishell that
we're all adults and if it's dinnertime, we can bring a sack lunch. On the other hand, it is generally
customary like you said.
But I will just raise-- and I'll say on the record personally, as a person who has severe food allergies and
can suffer anaphylactic shock and die within a few minutes, if I come into contact with certain allergens, I
just also want to caution that we just-- whatever policy we adopt, that we just make-- I guess I would just
ask the body to consider that. And I might not be the only person with allergies, too.
So one benefit of catering, and as Tai-Shrae pointed out, boxed lunches is that you can control the food
environment. So I just I just wanted to put that out there that there just might be some additional benefits
or drawbacks in keeping or changing the policy. But I really respect where everyone's coming from.
LYNN GUSSINGER: To not have food or to-JOYANN RUSCHA: Have a more controlled food environment if we do have food. And people do need to
eat. And also just consider, we might have individuals who are diabetic or have other dietary needs. So
getting down to Blake Street early, and sometimes those meetings go very long, there certainly is a
benefit in having food available not just from the vending machine, but I just wanted to put out there just
for safety reasons.
And as Tai-Shrae pointed out, catering has changed, too, with COVID and stuff that we might want to
consider, when we do have food, keeping it at a more controlled food environment.

LYNN GUSSINGER: Very good point. Thank you. So we can circle back on this as well. It's temporarily at
least not happening this month, and we can talk about it and see what might make sense, if it's paid out to
local government, and we can talk some more. All right. Anything else? OK, I'll entertain a motion to
adjourn.
BOBBY DISHELL: So moved.
PEGGY CATLIN: Second.
LYNN GUSSINGER: OK. We are adjourned as of 1:35 PM on Thursday the 23rd. Thank you. Is it the
23rd? No, it's not, the 20th. Sorry. OK. Have a good day.
