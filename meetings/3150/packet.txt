BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Funding Agreement - City of Boulder/HOP for 2021

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
January 12, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or her designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Funding Agreement with the City of Boulder to continue to provide RTD financial support for the
operation of the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University
of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2021 and is for an amount not to exceed $978,092.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has supplemented RTD’s bus service within the City of Boulder by providing
circulator bus service, known as the HOP, since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and
access to the commercial areas of the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business
and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and provide attractive
and effective transit service for people living, visiting, and working in the area. The HOP connects to
many local and regional RTD bus routes as well as with the Downtown Boulder and Boulder Junction at
Depot Square Stations.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HOP operated from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 10-minute frequencies and
7 p.m. to 10 p.m. at 15-minute frequencies on weekdays; 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 15-minute frequencies
and 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. at 20-minute frequencies on Saturdays; and 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 15-minute
frequencies and 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. at 20-minute frequency on Sundays and holidays. In response to the
COVID-19 pandemic and in alignment with RTD’s reduction in service levels, the HOP service was
changed to a Saturday schedule on weekdays and on actual Saturdays. Since June 2020, the HOP has
averaged approximately 524 boardings per weekday, which is down 80% from 2019 when average
boardings per weekday were 2,572.
In reviewing service hours operated and average ridership since 2011, the average hours operated per
month are trending upward while the average daily boardings are trending downward.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $978,092 in 2021. Funding for operation of the HOP is at 60% of the funding provided in
2020. The level of financial support for this agreement is determined based on what RTD would expect
to operate the service internally. This allows RTD to continue its partnership with the City of Boulder
while maintaining consistency with RTD’s service levels, accounting for the significant decrease in
ridership, as well as addressing the 2021 budget shortfall.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the HOP will be assessed at the
end of the year in cooperation with the City of Boulder. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s
service standards. If it appears that the service performance is not in line with similar RTD bus routes,
RTD and the City of Boulder will discuss modifications to the service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for RTD support of the HOP was included in the approved 2021 budget for a period of one year.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
FasTracks Series 2012A Bonds and TIFIA Loan Refunding

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
January 12, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Bond Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Tax –
Exempt and Taxable Refunding Bonds, Series 2021(FasTracks Project).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD entered into a Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan
agreement with the United States Department of Transportation to assist in funding the Eagle Project.
The TIFIA loan has an approximately $342 million balance remaining to be paid. The TIFIA loan may be
refunded at any time, there is no optional redemption date (call date) that must be met.
In 2012, RTD issued its FasTracks Series 2012A Sales Tax Bonds to finance the FasTracks Project.
Approximately $475 million of these bonds remain to be paid. These bonds have a 10 year optional
redemption date meaning that a refunding effectuated before the optional redemption date of November
1, 2022 requires that an advance refunding occurs in which taxable bonds, rather than tax-exempt
bonds, be issued.
The approaching optional redemption date and current low interest rate environment have created an
opportunity to refinance these obligations to realize a reduction in interest expense.
DISCUSSION
In order to complete this refunding for interest savings, RTD will issue both a Series 2021A taxable and
Series 2021B tax-exempt bonds. Tax-exempt bonds generally have a lower interest cost, however, a
portion of the refunding does not qualify for tax-exempt bonds since the optional redemption date has
not yet been reached. In order to maximize interest savings on the taxable bonds, RTD will make a
tender offer to current bondholders in which the refunding bonds will make those bondholders whole
while also sharing a portion of the savings to encourage early redemption. In addition, RTD plans to
designate the Refunding bonds as Green Bonds. Green Bonds are issued to finance environmentally
friendly projects and draw additional interest from investors seeking socially responsible investments
thereby creating additional demand for these bonds.
The attached Resolution allows for the refunding of the FasTracks Series 2012A Sales Tax Bonds and
FasTracks TIFIA loan for interest savings. The related contractual documents required to effectuate the
refundings are identified in the Resolution and include:

Resolution No. __ delegates to the General Manager or the Acting Chief Financial Officer the authority
(effective for one year following the date thereof) to determine terms of the Series 2021A refunding
bonds, provided that: (a)
the final maturity of the 2021A Bonds shall be no later than November 1,
2037; and the final maturity of the 2021B Bonds shall be no later than November 1, 2045;
(b)
the net effective interest rate of the 2021A Bonds shall be less than the net effective interest
rate of the Refunded 2012A Bonds; and the net effective interest rate of the 2021B Bonds shall be less
than the combined net effective interest rate of the RTD TIFIA Bond and the Tendered 2012A Bonds;
(c)
the combined maximum annual repayment cost of the Bonds and all other outstanding debt
issued pursuant to the 2004 Election shall not exceed the maximum annual repayment cost authorized in
the notice of election sent to the voters in connection with the 2004 Election;
(d)
the combined debt service requirements of the Bonds and all other outstanding debt issued
pursuant to the 2004 Election, when combined with the debt service requirements previously paid for all
other debt issued pursuant to the 2004 Election, shall not exceed the maximum total repayment cost
authorized at the 2004 Election;
(e)
the net purchase price of the 2021A Bonds shall not be less than 98% of the original principal
amount of the 2021A Bonds; the net purchase price of the 2021B Bonds shall not be less than 98% of
the original principal amount of the 2021B Bonds; provided that in the event that the 2021A Bonds and
the 2021B Bonds are issued at the same time and sold to the same Underwriters, the net purchase price
of the Bonds shall be not less than 98% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Bonds; and
(f)
the net present value savings of the 2021A Refunding Project shall not be less than 3.00% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Refunded 2012A Bonds; and the net present value savings of the
2021B Refunding Project shall not be less than 3.00% of the principal amount of the RTD TIFIA Bond
and the Tendered 2012A Bonds; provided that in the event the 2021A Bonds and the 2021B Bonds are
issued at the same time and both the Refunding Projects are effectuated, the net present value savings
of the combined Refunding Projects shall not be less than 3.00% of the combined aggregate principal
amount of the Refunded 2012A Bonds, the RTD TIFIA Bond and the Tendered 2012A Bonds.
General Manager or the Acting Chief Financial Officer is authorized to make the determination as to the
amount of bonds refunded under the tender offer. Such determinations with respect to the Bonds shall
be set forth in a Sale Certificate to be executed by the General Manager or the Acting Chief Financial
Officer.

2.B.1

RTD is receiving the advice of Hilltop Securities as independent financial advisors, Butler Snow LLP as
bond counsel and Hogan Lovells as disclosure counsel in regard to the transaction. The bonds will be
sold through an underwriting syndicate consisting of Goldman Sachs, RBC, Harveston Securities, and
Stifel.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial market conditions as of November 16, 2020 would create savings to RTD of approximately
$20 million (5.9% net present value savings) for the TIFIA Loan refunding and $56 million (11.8% net
present value savings) for the Series 2012A Sales Tax Revenue Bond (FasTracks Project) refunding.
Costs of the refinancing including professional fees, Green Bond designation and tender agent fees will
be paid from the proceeds of the refunding bonds.

It is recommended by RTD Directors Lewis, Dishell, and Bouquet that the Board of Directors adopt the
plan detailed below relating to ongoing Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion workshops.
BACKGROUND
We acknowledge that there is still so much work to do to address systemic racism in this country,
particularly as it pertains to the role and responsibility of our transit industry. As an agency, justice,
equity, diversity, and inclusion (“JEDI”) should be a lens through which we make each and every
decision. RTD’s Service Area contains over 3.08 million people (Attachment 1). In the 2019 Customer
Satisfaction Survey, 30% of participants made 185% (Attachment 2), or less of the national poverty
threshold for their household, 38% identify as non-white, and 46% do not have a college degree
(Attachment 3). While RTD has many discount programs available, 81% of riders pay the full fare
(Attachment 4). When looking at RTD’s work force, 46% identify as non-white (Attachment 5). The
RTD Board of Directors (the “Board”) recognizes and acknowledges that not only does the Board not
reflect the demographics it serves, but no one individual can be or should be the spokesperson for a
community’s needs. Further, the Board acknowledges it is not the sole responsibility of marginalized
communities to educate those who hold positions of power.
In order to have JEDI be a lens through which we operate, the RTD Board needs to have ongoing
workshops to better understand systemic inequities, our own identities, power, and how these intersect.
JEDI is not simply a one-time training but requires ongoing work on the part of the individual. These
workshops will serve as the first step of many as we work to truly represent the passengers and
communities the Board serves.
In the past year, when the Board discussed issues related to equity, the Board did not utilize the same
language or operate from a common meaning of equity. In addition to giving the Board a better
understanding of those we serve, the JEDI workshops will also assist the Board in (i) operating from a
common understanding of what equity means, (ii) building trust through working through identity related
work, and (iii) being able to authentically engage in using a JEDI lens when approaching RTD’s strategy
and vision.
This process is one that requires synchronization, shared goals, and a comprehensive strategy - not one
that can be piecemealed together. The first step in getting there is education through workshops.

3.B.1

DISCUSSION
The Board commits to participating in at least quarterly JEDI workshops. The Board will cause the first
workshop to be completed by March 31, 2021. In addition, each member of the Board commits to
specifically soliciting feedback from its constituents on JEDI as it relates to RTD during each Director’s
scheduled telephone Town Hall meeting. Each member of the Board acknowledges that these workshops
are some of the first steps we must take in order to address the systemic inequities.
The Board will work with staff designated by the General Manager/CEO to create a comprehensive JEDI
plan that aligns with the General Manager/CEO’s strategy. This strategy may include items such as:
ensuring all RTD employees receive ongoing JEDI workshops; a plan to ensure proper JEDI training for
RTD’s contractors; differentiated JEDI workshops based on an individual’s role within the agency; and a
plan to implement changes based on learnings from various workshops. By way of example, but not
limitation, those who manage others will need different workshop components compared to those who
are on our front lines directly interacting with the public.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
In considering the financial impact of JEDI workshops, it is important to consider the cost of not having
ongoing JEDI workshops and a comprehensive plan. These costs include ongoing recruitment, retention,
among other costs that come with not having a just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive workplace and
agency. There are also cost savings seen across organizations in terms of increased efficiencies and
productivity for diverse, equitable, and inclusive organizations.
The financial impact of the implementation plan for the agency-wide plan will be detailed in the plan
created by staff and presented to the Board for consideration when the plan is presented for adoption.
The financial impact of the JEDI workshops for the Board of Directors will not exceed $50,000 over two
years. The Board of Directors will solicit a new two-year agreement no later than June 1, 2022.

The separate poverty guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii reflect Office of Economic Opportunity administrative practice
beginning in the 1966-1970 period. Note that the poverty thresholds — the original version of the poverty measure —
have never had separate figures for Alaska and Hawaii. The poverty guidelines are not defined for Puerto Rico, the U.S.
Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau. In cases in which a Federal program using the poverty
guidelines serves any of those jurisdictions, the Federal office which administers the program is responsible for deciding
whether to use the contiguous-states-and-D.C. guidelines for those jurisdictions or to follow some other procedure.
The poverty guidelines apply to both aged and non-aged units. The guidelines have never had an aged/non-aged
distinction; only the Census Bureau (statistical) poverty thresholds have separate figures for aged and non-aged oneperson and two-person units.
Programs using the guidelines (or percentage multiples of the guidelines — for instance, 125 percent or 185 percent of
the guidelines) in determining eligibility include Head Start, the Supplemental Nutition Assistance Program (SNAP), the
National School Lunch Program, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and the Children’s Health
Insurance Program. Note that in general, cash public assistance programs (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
and Supplemental Security Income) do NOT use the poverty guidelines in determining eligibility. The Earned Income Tax

The poverty guidelines (unlike the poverty thresholds) are designated by the year in which they are issued. For instance,
the guidelines issued in January 2020 are designated the 2020 poverty guidelines. However, the 2020 HHS poverty
guidelines only reflect price changes through calendar year 2019; accordingly, they are approximately equal to the
in September 2020; a preliminary version of the 2019 thresholds is now available from the Census Bureau.)
The poverty guidelines may be formally referenced as “the poverty guidelines updated periodically in the Federal
Register by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).”

There are two slightly different versions of the federal poverty measure: poverty thresholds and poverty guidelines.

Attachment: Attachment 2 - Poverty Guidelines ASPE (4456 : Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Proposal)

Census Bureau poverty thresholds for calendar year 2019. (The 2019 thresholds are expected to be issued in final form

The poverty thresholds are the original version of the federal poverty measure. They are updated each year by the Census
Bureau. The thresholds are used mainly for statistical purposes — for instance, preparing estimates of the number of
Americans in poverty each year. (In other words, all official poverty population figures are calculated using the poverty

thresholds, not the guidelines). Poverty thresholds since 1973 (and for selected earlier years) and weighted average poverty

thresholds since 1959 are available on the Census Bureau’s Web site. For an example of how the Census Bureau applies the
thresholds to a family’s income to determine its poverty status, see “How the Census Bureau Measures Poverty” on the
Census Bureau’s web site.
The poverty guidelines are the other version of the federal poverty measure. They are issued each year in the Federal
Register by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The guidelines are a simplification of the poverty
thresholds for use for administrative purposes — for instance, determining financial eligibility for certain federal programs.
The poverty guidelines are sometimes loosely referred to as the “federal poverty level” (FPL), but that phrase is ambiguous
and should be avoided, especially in situations (e.g., legislative or administrative) where precision is important.

Key differences between poverty thresholds and poverty guidelines are outlined in a table under Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQs). See also the discussion of this topic on the Institute for Research on Poverty’s web site.
The January 2020 poverty guidelines are calculated by taking the 2018 Census Bureau’s poverty thresholds and adjusting

them for price changes between 2018 and 2019 using the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The poverty thresholds used by the
Census Bureau for statistical purposes are complex and are not composed of standardized increments between family sizes.
Since many program officials prefer to use guidelines with uniform increments across family sizes, the poverty guidelines
include rounding and standardizing adjustments.

corporate and nonprofit boards have barely moved the needle on diversification.

Last February, BlackRock, Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, sent letters to companies on the Ru
Index with fewer than two women on their boards asking them to justify this lack of gender diversity
on efforts to increase diversity. “Irrespective of a company’s industry, location or size, we believe tha

The nonprofit sector mirrors this lack of diversity in leadership at the organizational and board level
percentage of people of color in nonprofit board seats has remained under 20 percent for the last 15
doesn’t show any signs of changing despite growing awareness of the strategic, financial, and social b
diversity.

So why are corporate and nonprofit boards so slow to change? In both sectors there is a stark gap be
understanding and action. A 2017 PwC survey of nearly 900 directors found that a majority of them –
recognize that diversity is beneficial. Of that segment, 94% said gender and racial diversity brings un
perspectives to the boardroom, 82% agreed that it enhances board performance, and 59% tied it to b
company performance. Clearly, the majority of boards understand the value of diversity.

A survey of nonprofit boards by executive search firm Koya Leadership Partners found that 96 perce
respondents believe that diversifying their boards is a key objective, but only 24 percent have taken a
toward increasing diversity.

Clearly, directors in both the corporate and nonprofit sector understand the value of diversity. But th
show they are doing very little to walk the talk when it comes to actually diversifying their boards.

The Koya Leadership Partners study shows that many directors in the nonprofit sector simply don’t k
actions they should take. They lack the knowledge, skills, resources, and commitment to change requ
awareness into action.

The highest impact change that any board, of any size, in any sector or location, can immediately put
to change the way it recruits members. Most boards recruit through existing relationships and by wo
which almost always ensures that new members will be similar in gender, race, and socioeconomic st
current directors.

These informal recruitment processes will do very little to increase gender, racial, or any other desir
diversity, and should be replaced by strategic recruiting plans that begin with an evaluation of the cu
identify missing skills, characteristics, and other qualities, and implement proactive, measurable step
beyond the “usual suspects” to identify and assess potential board members who bring both high qua
diverse perspective and background.

Board chairs and CEOs have a particularly important role to play when it comes to driving change. Ed
directors about why diversity matters, ensuring that diversity is a key strategic priority for the board
as a whole, and holding the board accountable for diversity efforts are all critical steps these leaders
should play to ensure that boards of directors are unlocking the full potential of the organizations th

color were at the table, we might hear stronger challenges to expensive new
rail projects that tilt the scales away from investment in bus service and
amenities in communities of color where riders live. We might have a more
comprehensive conversation about policing on transit, and what “safety”
means in practice. If more people from the disabled community were on
transit boards, their colleagues might grasp the gravity of inaccessibility
and prioritize requisite changes.
Personal experience is not the only path to empathy. However, transit policy
should be based on facts about rider experience and needs.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Ehrman writes, has been a leader in this
regard, using his appointments to triple representation by women and people
of color on the board of the state-run MTA since taking office.

In Rhode Island, the statewide transit agency board has 8 members, 4 are female, 2 are
African-American, but to my knowledge the only one who rides frequently is a white
male.

As a statistic, 2 of the 7 directors of AC Transit in Oakland CA (which is an elected
position) are people I run into while using the bus. Staﬀers, not so much.

Exactly, and your experience is not all that unique. Even in lily white Utah, UTA
board members ride the trains and buses. This is just an ongoing narrative in
search of even more outrage because heaven knows we don't have enough

Birmingham's board is very diversified - https://maxtransit.org/abou... - and we have
one of the most shit transportation systems in the country. Just google news the
problems they have (BJCTA Board). Nice try, but what transportation needs is a
commitment from the community in the form of funding. Acting like adding diversity to a

It’s not just transit. If we’re ever going to make meaningful strides in equitability in

Yep – this is an issue across almost all organizations. These boards are
volunteer, no benefits, meet during the day, and are a huge commitment.
As is, these various advisory board seats are predominantly occupied by
60-something year olds taking victory laps after prestigious white collar
careers. That’s a population niche that doesn’t ride the bus with me.

The “Choice” vs. “Captive” Transit Rider

To describe how many of us spend our workdays, we could replace “fix radios” with:
writes software, engineers driverless cars, advances therapeutics, builds financial portfolios,
or designs smartphones. To be accurate though, we would have to replace the “he” with
“we” for teams, not individuals, perform most cognitive work.
Teams predominate because teams win. The best teams outperform the best individuals on
complex tasks. The problems we confront, whether in business, government, or the
academy, require both depth and breadth of knowledge and skills. Engineering the
propulsion system for an aircraft carrier requires deep technical knowledge. Carving a canoe
paddle is a lower dimensional, shallower task. That propulsion system must also fit within
the geometry of the ship and produce minimal environmental impact. The optimal design
requires breadth across what had been academic silos of engineering, architecture, and
environmental sciences. Aggregate evidence backs up the anecdotal story: 90% of new
patents fall into two or more patent classes. In the 20th century, fewer than half did.
A team can possess greater depth and breadth only if their members possess cognitive
diversity. Two heads will only be better than one if their contents differ. Differences in how
people think — differences in problem representations, categorizations, knowledge bases,
heuristics, technical and tacit skills, and experiences — are what enable teams to find more
novel solutions, develop more creative solutions, make fewer inferential errors, and
construct more accurate predictions than individuals.
The importance of cognitive diversity means that to select the best team of people, you
cannot give some test or come up with set of criteria and select the “best” individuals. That
won’t work. In fact, a study from Microsoft research shows that even when putting together
a team to take an IQ test, you should seek "contextual diversity" and not necessarily the
highest scorers. To construct a creative, brilliant teams you need to combine diverse
thinkers. Those Apple ads speak truth: think different. Not just you though, your entire
team.
What, though, of identity diversity — differences in race, gender expression, sexual
orientation, religion, ethnicity, and physical ability — does that also improve team
performance? Yes! It can. Identity diversity can correlate with cognitive diversity and
therefore improve the team. It won’t always, but on many tasks, identity diversity will be a
strong proxy for thinking different.
Identity diversity can contribute to cognitive diversity in four ways. First, identity diversity
correlates with cognitive diversity. Our identity characteristics correlate with the classes we
take, books we read, movies we watch, news we consume, and websites we visit. Who we

are influences what we know and
Attachment: (3) Just having people who look different isn't enough to create a diverse team LinkedIn (4456 : Justice, Equity, Diversity, and

how we think. The economic,
social, and political lives we
construct are interwoven with who
we are. How else to explain how
Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and
Amazon can predict our identities
with near perfect accuracy?
When thinking about creating
diverse teams, we must keep in
mind that these identity attributes
do not operate separately. We
cannot decompose a Native
American man’s cognitive
repertoire into a Native American
part and a male part. There is no
single “woman’s perspective” or
“African-American viewpoint.”
Each person’s bundle of identity
attributes produces her unique
cognitive repertoire .
That said, we must resist the urge to go naively syllogistic: identity diversity correlates
with cognitive diversity and cognitive diversity improves team performance; ergo,
identity diversity improves team performance. That will often be true. But the extent
of identity diversity’s contribution to relevant cognitive diversity will vary by task.
Our lived differences should lead to ideas and insights that move the needle on any task that
results in a product, service, or policy for our diverse society. A bunch of fifty-four-year-old
white guys (that’s me by the way) won’t be that innovative at designing a shoe, writing a
policy briefing, or designing a nightclub. More broadly, identity diversity should contribute
germane, meaningful cognitive diversity when designing and engineering products,
improving health care services, developing drug protocols, creating an environmental
awareness campaign, writing social policy, scripting movies, analyzing company
performance, creating software applications, or contemplating the meaning of fairness, and
more. All of these tasks benefit from a rich understanding of the diversity of human
experiences, goals, needs and wants.
On more “pure” research tasks such as isolating molecules, writing error free code, deriving
mathematical results, and designing plasma engines, we might expect that identity matters

less, that scientists leave their identities at the laboratory door. On those problems, the
Attachment: (3) Just having people who look different isn't enough to create a diverse team LinkedIn (4456 : Justice, Equity, Diversity, and

relevant cognitive diversity might result from education, training, and experiences. That
position ignores the possibility that identity differences might influence the analogies we
draw, the representations we choose, or the attributes that scientists emphasize when doing
research. The role of identity in deciding which questions to ask and how to ask them may
well explain the significant citation bonus found from having an ethnically diverse team.
Second, being in a room with identity diverse people causes most people to think and act
smarter. We relax around people who look like us. The presence of identity diversity creates
discomfort. That discomfort can cause us to question assumptions, and provide richer
explanations. Studies show that identity diverse groups suffer from less group think.
Third, identity diversity also correlates with the ability to work well in diverse
groups. Achieving success in an identity diverse group requires an inclusive culture. People
must feel validated and share a sense of mission to bring their full cognitive repertoires. A
series of studies of collective intelligence in teams find a significant gender effect — adding
women to the team improves collective IQ. It cannot be the identities themselves that lead to
better performance. Breakthroughs may occur through serendipity, but they do not arise by
magic. So, for example, in the collective IQ studies, the gender effect can be explained by a
correlation between gender and the ability to read emotions. The women in the groups
were, on average, better able to read facial cues.
Last, if we create inclusive workplaces (easier said than done), we enlarge the pool of
talent. A larger pool means more cognitive diversity. This is true even if identity diversity
has no effect. An analogy from ecology explains why. Consider species diversity. It scales
with land area, a regularity codified in species area laws. Similarly, the diversity of each
species also scales with its population size. The bigger the sea, the more species of fish. The
more tiger sharks, the more diverse they are as well.
In Scale: The Universal Laws of Growth, Innovation, Sustainability, and the Pace
of Life in Organisms, Cities, Economies, and Companies, physicist Geoffrey West
shows that similar regularities of scale exist in the social world. Make the city larger, you
get more professions. It follows that if within a profession, we increase the potential pool —
if engineering schools attract more women and if psychology departments attract more men
— then that larger pool will be more diverse. That would be true even if identity diversity
did not produce cognitive diversity. It’s a matter of scale: increase the population, and
you increase the cognitive diversity.
So, for people working on teams try to fix cancer or fix inequality by thinking, you would
likely benefit by both seeking out identity diversity now and building infrastructure to ensure
pathways for the even more diverse next generation of workers.

Equally important, you must let go of the idea that there exists a tradeoff between team

performance and adding identity diversity. That way of thinking can prove selffulfilling. For identity diverse teams to perform well, their members must see their
differences as value producing and not as political necessities. For diversity to produce
benefits, team members must believe that it can. They must make space for everyone to
contribute and listen extra hard to novel ideas. And team leaders and conveners must be
willing to be use the ideas of others. Otherwise, the team adds no value.
In The Diversity Bonus, I discuss these issues in more detail. I study cases where identity
diversity adds value and cases where it does not. I show how the weight of the evidence
leans towards identity mattering. What’s most remarkable to me is that these data come
from the world as it is now, a world where identity differences, in addition to producing
what I call bonuses, also create issues of trust, validation, and belonging. We cannot know
the potential magnitude of identity diversity bonuses until we create a more tolerant,
inclusive world where we can each lean in with our unique shoulders to help push the wheel.

I think that there is a group of people that already fundamentally know that diversity at all levels is a
good thing because it is good, period. Then there are the other people that need to be influenced or

Too often, the inability to more beyond a Kodak moment understanding of diversity is what prevents a
good organization, school or institution from being a great one. Doing the groundwork to create a
welcoming and inclusive workspace so that the benefits of diversification can flourish is a commonly
missed first step. A focus on achieving short term "equity" goals can limit the long term benefits of such
efforts. I appreciate the assets focused nature of this piece, as it's not a common stance.

white ones) aren’t sure what... more

As protests sweep the United States, it’s clear that returning to
“business as usual” will not be good for business. In just a few days,
countless companies that don’t talk about racism publicly have
spoken out to condemn racism and police brutality. Employees of
color have openly called out racism in their own institutions. On this
critical issue, neither consumers nor employees are looking for vague
platitudes about change; they want to see companies committing to
action within their own walls. Achieving racial equity in the
workplace will be one of the most important issues that companies
will tackle in the coming decade.
This became evident to me months ago, when I spoke with almost
two dozen executives of Fortune 500 companies. My goal was to
understand if and how they were thinking about racial equity as part
of my work at Living Cities, a nonprofit focused on closing income
and wealth gaps in America. The vast majority affirmed that racial
equity was an obvious business imperative. But less obvious was what
to do about it. With traditional diversity interventions failing, these
leaders — the majority of whom were white — reported feeling illequipped, even afraid, to act.
Given U.S. history, it shouldn’t surprise us that race makes corporate
leaders uneasy. It certainly made me uneasy when, six years ago,
members of my staff told me that Living Cities was a hard place to
work for people of color. They shared that, despite a racially diverse
staff, our office culture dictated that people of color only contribute
in ways that white people, including me, were comfortable with.
Project leads relied on “objective” reports and case studies, while

dismissing data from staff’s personal experiences as “too emotional.”
When horrific instances of racial injustice occurred, like the murders
Attachment: Moving Beyond Diversity Toward Racial Equity (4456 : Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Proposal)

of Trayvon Martin or Tamir Rice, our workday continued largely
unaffected, with little acknowledgement or space for the emotions
they triggered for staff. Discussions about racism were discouraged as
“divisive” or “unproductive.” In short, our workplace was unable to
acknowledge the lives they live and value them for who they are.
Racism’s legacy is complex, brutally ugly, deeply personal, and yet to
be truly reckoned with, especially in the workplace. Not even 60
years from the end of legal racial segregation, there’s no question that
the harmful effects of that history live on in our institutions and in
each of us. Further, it’s clear that the suite of diversity and inclusion
tools and practices that went mainstream in the ‘90s are grossly
insufficient for racial equity work. Instead of driving fundamental
changes in organizations, they largely focus on “velcro-ing” new
guidelines, practices, or programs onto the existing structures and
culture of the workplace in an attempt to help employees of color
better “fit in” and succeed.
Today’s racial equity and inclusion efforts must flip that premise on
its head. Instead of trying to change some people to fit the
organization, we must focus on transforming our organizations to fit
all people. What I’ve realized over the six years since that initial, very
difficult conversation with my staff is that our culture was the
problem and had to be changed. To move toward racial equity,
organizational culture must prioritize humanity. People need the
ability to work with the dignity of having their histories
acknowledged and their life experience valued. Only then will

decade, and beyond.
At Living Cities, we have been striving for years to take up this
charge. And to be clear, we are not done. Nor do I expect that we will
ever be: building and maintaining this racial equity culture is a daily
practice. It is hard. Still, I am writing this piece with other white
leaders like myself in mind, to share some of the playbook that our
organization has found valuable so they can focus on the right things
and move beyond their fear.
In particular, this process has forced me to abandon many
mainstream, deeply internalized norms around organizational
leadership. Here are three of the most important lessons:
Understand How Power Works and Use it for Change
From 1619 to 1965, this country had laws, policies and practices —
from slavery to Jim Crow to redlining — that legally separated white
and Black people in an attempt to maintain a white supremacist
society. The inhumanity required for people to function in such a
society — to dehumanize others and be dehumanized — has left its
mark on our nation and, by extension, our organizations in
innumerable ways.
And yet many white leaders like myself have gone through our lives
and careers with only the shallowest understanding of racism in
America, blind to our own white culture and its harms. In contrast, it
was quickly revealed to me throughout this process the ways that my

Black colleagues, and colleagues of color more broadly, have long
understood racism’s costs and impact, inside an office and out, as a
Attachment: Moving Beyond Diversity Toward Racial Equity (4456 : Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Proposal)

matter of survival.
So, to build a new, more inclusive culture, we first needed to be able
to see the norms, values, and practices in our institutions that
advantage white people and ways of working, to the exclusion and
oppression of all others.
To do this, we had to commit time and resources to staff members’
individual learning. Understanding history, interrogating personal
biases, building empathy and respect for others, getting comfortable
with vulnerability — these skills require training and ongoing
practice. This is dedicated, individual work that must be modeled
from the top. To start, all staff, including myself, underwent multiday anti-racism trainings to build a shared vocabulary, definitions
and analysis to ground our group conversations. New staff members
are now expected to take this training within 90 days of hire. A
permanent, in-house team of staff (Colleagues Operationalizing
Racial Equity, or CORE) are responsible for the deepening of this
practice, on an ongoing basis, through trainings, Employee Resource
Groups, all-staff conversations, coaching, and internal racial equity
consultation for other teams.
Putting these skills into action at work requires deep understanding
and harnessing power. Each of us is learning to ask: What informal
and formal power do I hold to shift culture? How should I wield it to
change damaging norms and power dynamics within our institution?
For example, I long considered the departures of Black staff members
largely to be isolated cases. It took others in the organization to raise
what I wasn’t seeing: a pattern. That realization forced me to grapple

with new questions, such as the racial competencies of those
conducting exit interviews, what questions were being asked, and
Attachment: Moving Beyond Diversity Toward Racial Equity (4456 : Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Proposal)

why the information gathered about those departures was not
seriously interrogated.
Similarly, time and time again, staff have pointed out how notions of
“professionalism” and “appropriateness” have been wielded by white
people to avoid or stifle challenging perspectives or conversations. I
had to reckon with the fact that I had allowed our culture to, de facto,
authorize a small group to define what issues are “legitimate” to talk
about, and when and how those issues are discussed, to the exclusion
of many. One way to address this was by naming it when I saw it
happening in meetings, as simply as stating, “I think this is what is
happening right now,” giving staff members license to continue with
challenging conversations, and making it clear that everyone else was
expected to do the same.
In particular, I’ve found that the Person-Role-System framework
promoted by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, has helped deepen each
staff member’s ability to contribute to building our inclusive culture.
The simplicity of this framework is its power. Each of us is expected
to use our racial equity competencies to see day-to-day issues that
arise in our roles differently and then use our power to challenge and
change the culture accordingly.
For me, in my role as CEO, that meant relinquishing some of my
formal authority to a group of more inclusive decision-makers so that

our loan funds to focus exclusively on closing racial income and
wealth gaps, and built a portfolio that puts people of color in
decision-making positions and begins to challenge definitions of
creditworthiness and other norms.
Conflict Must be Understood and Embraced as Part of the
Process
Conflict is not only incidental but is required for transformation to
occur and be sustained. It’s been said that conflict — from discomfort
to active disagreement — is change trying to happen. Unfortunately,
most workplaces today go to great lengths to avoid conflict of any
type. That has to change. The cultures we seek to create cannot brush
past or ignore conflict, or worse, direct blame or anger toward those
who are pushing for needed transformation.
For example, I have yet to attend a single racial equity training
session where the simple use of words like “racism,” “whiteness,”
and “privilege” have not made people visibly uncomfortable. My own
colleagues have reflected that, in the early days of our racial equity
work, the seemingly innocuous descriptor “white people” uttered in
an all-staff meeting was met with tense silence by the many white
staff in the room. Left unchallenged in the moment, that silence
would have either maintained the status quo of shutting down
discussions when the anxiety of white people is high or required staff
of color to shoulder all the political and social risk of speaking up.

Conflict is also an inherent part of interrupting the patterns that
maintain structural disadvantages around issues such as hiring, pay
Attachment: Moving Beyond Diversity Toward Racial Equity (4456 : Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Proposal)

equity, and advancement. If no one had challenged me on the
turnover patterns of Black staff, we likely never would have changed
our behaviors. Similarly, it is risky and uncomfortable to point out
racist dynamics when they show up in daily interactions, such as the
treatment of people of color in meetings, or team or work
assignments. Over the course of years, it was the leadership of staff at
all levels within the organization — particularly Black women, as is
often the case — to take great risks in challenging me to reflect on my
blind spots and use my authority to commit the organization to this
change process. My job as a leader continuously is to model a culture
that is supportive of that conflict by intentionally setting aside
defensiveness in favor of public displays of vulnerability when
disparities and concerns are raised.
To help staff and leadership become more comfortable with conflict,
we use a “comfort, stretch, panic” framework. The framework helps
assess your own state of mind and physiological reactions when
facing challenging moments. Interactions that make us want to shut
down are moments where we are just being challenged to think
differently. Too often, we conflate this healthy stretch zone with our
panic zone, where we are paralyzed by fear, unable to learn. As a
result, we shut down. Discerning our own boundaries and
committing to staying engaged through the stretch is necessary to
push through to change.
Adoption of this framework was essential to my own ability to
embark on this culture change process. Running diverse but not
inclusive organizations and talking in “race neutral” ways about the
challenges facing our nation were within my comfort zone. With little

individual understanding or experience creating a racially inclusive
culture, the idea of intentionally bringing issues of race into the
Attachment: Moving Beyond Diversity Toward Racial Equity (4456 : Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Proposal)

organization sent me into panic mode. Understanding that this was
going to be a learning journey that would require me and all my staff
to stretch ourselves gave me permission to focus on learning about
race and racism, managing discomfort, and building competencies to
distinguish between real danger worthy of panic and stretch-induced
fear.
Commit to Ongoing Learning and Long-Term Transformation
The work of building and maintaining an inclusive, racially equitable
culture is never done. The personal work alone to challenge our own
individual and professional socialization is like peeling a neverending onion. Organizations must commit to sustained steps over
time, to demonstrate they are making a multi-faceted and long-term
investment in the culture — if for no other reason than to honor the
vulnerability that staff members bring to the process. This work is
hard and takes a deeply personal toll. The process is only as good as
the commitment, trust, and goodwill from the staff who engage in it
— whether that’s confronting one’s own white fragility or sharing the
harms that one has experienced in the office as a person of color over
the years.
I’ve also seen that the cost to people of color, most particularly Black
people, in the process of building new culture is enormous. We
perpetuate inhumanity in the workplace when we explicitly or
implicitly rely on people of color, especially Black people, to carry the
burdens of educating others or fighting racism instead of us. My own
staff members have told me time and time again that always having to
be the advocate for equity, share personal stories, and experience

firsthand their colleagues’ anger, fear, and guilt as they build their
competencies is like ripping open an old wound. As leaders,
Attachment: Moving Beyond Diversity Toward Racial Equity (4456 : Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Proposal)

especially as white people, failure to stay the course and to use our
power to disproportionately shoulder the burden to combat racism at
work is a violation of the trust that they’ve put in us and this process.
To do this effectively, as with all elements of management, you
measure progress and adapt based on data. We formally track change
in our organizational culture in multiple ways. For example, we track
staff engagement, satisfaction, and tenure disaggregated by race, role
and level so that we can identify where there are disparities. We
conduct an annual competency survey to gauge our collective
understanding of how race impacts our work, asking questions like:
How well equipped are staff to identify and address interpersonal,
institutional, and structural racism in the workplace? How often are
staff taking risks and putting aside discomfort to engage in critical
conversations? How much does organizational leadership participate
in and support conversations about racial equity internally? Our
annual staff performance reviews hold every staff member
accountable for achievement against a personal racial equity and
inclusion objective at the beginning of the year.
Organizations cannot afford not to do this work, but they also can’t
enter into it lightly, under the misconception that a training or
workshop checks the box. True racial equity and inclusion work in
the workplace must look unlike anything we’ve done in past decades,
because we’ve consistently failed to tackle racial inequity at its
deepest roots. But we can start today, by bringing our fullest selves to
the offices and desks where we spend most of our waking lives and
empowering each other to do the same.

6. COMPANY meetings tend to start and end on time.
7. Our meetings usually take place during times that are convenient for me.
8. Most meetings I attend have an agenda.
9. We generally stick to the meeting agenda.
10. In my recurring meetings, we rotate facilitator and note-taker responsibilities.
11. Administrative responsibilities in meetings are distributed equally (e.g., scheduling, note-taking,
sending follow up notes, tech setup).
12. Someone usually tracks time during our meetings so we don’t run over.
13. When we start to go off track, someone in the meeting usually helps us refocus.
14. There are clear action items at the end of most meetings I attend.
15. Most people share their perspectives in our meetings.
16. I am able to share my perspectives during our meetings.
17. I feel that my suggestions and comments in meetings are respected by my coworkers.
18. We tend to give people credit for their ideas in our meetings.
19. Overall, most meetings I attend at COMPANY are a good use of my time.
Open questions:
What is your role? (IC, manager, director, VP, executive)
How many hours do you spend in meetings in a typical week?
What is the biggest meeting problem at your COMPANY?

Growth Opportunities Assessment
Send the following survey to your employees or team to assess growth opportunities.
Clarify whether you want feedback about a specific meeting or your meeting culture in general.
Use a scale of 1-5, with 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree.

HOW TO CREATE A DEI TASK FORCE

Organizations with DEI task forces see increased participation in DEI work, diversification of the voices and
perspectives involved in DEI decision-making, and improvements toward becoming a more inclusive and
equitable company.​ A
​ sk the taskforce to complete an audit above (​see the LifeLabs Inclusion Audit​) of your
current practices like meeting norms, decision-making structures, interview practices, and work-from-home
policies. Have the taskforce ask questions like:
● Who might be ​most​ impacted by this?
● What perspectives haven’t we considered?
● Is there a more equitable way to do this?

Sample DEI task force curriculum (Group of 6-10 people)
This curriculum is for a 3 month taskforce, meeting every other week for 60 minutes. Ideally, the first
meeting would be longer to accommodate more team building and alignment setting!
●

●

●

●

Meeting 1: Connect & align
○ AGENDA:
■ Intro: Taskforce leader shares why the taskforce was created
■ Ground-rules: What norms will allow the group to be most effective?
■ Round Robin: Introductions if needed, and share what brought them here
■ Brainstorm: What would make us feel like we’ve accomplished what we set out to
do?
■ Round Robin: What will keep you committed to this taskforce?
Meeting 2: Vision & goals
○ AGENDA:
■ Review: What did we say would make us feel successful? (review from last
meeting)
■ Brainstorm: How might we go about getting there?
■ Brainstorm: What areas do we want to focus on? (Use the LifeLabs ​Inclusion Audit
as a guide for what to focus on.)
■ Brainstorm: How do we want to involve the company leadership? How do we want
to involve all employees?
■ Round Robin: What is the purpose of this group? (collect thoughts, designate one
person to put thoughts together and propose a final statement)
Meeting 3: Plan creation + naming of Individual responsibilities (who will do what, by when?). See
sample message below.
○ AGENDA:
■ Review: Which areas did we say we want to focus on? (review from last meeting)
■ Action: Each person selects 1-2 areas they’d like to work on.
■ Breakout Rooms: Each subgroup gets together and establishes a plan of action
(interview employees, research internal documentation, connect with department
leaders, etc.)
■ Round Robin: What are you excited about?
Meeting 4: Reporting results so far, creating recommendation lists for each bucket of the audit.

○ AGENDA:
■ Round Robin: Quick taskforce updates, 1-2 minutes each
■ Next steps: Who needs the information each taskforce has collected? How will that
be shared? Who will be owning it?
■ Brainstorm: As a group, what are our next steps?
Meeting 6: Retrospective (what went well, what did we learn, what can we celebrate?)
○ AGENDA:
■ Round Robin: What are you proud of (in context of this group)?
■ Brainstorm: Create a list of the work we’ve done (with a scribe capturing it)
■ Taskforce leader: Share appreciation and impact
■ Taskforce leader: Confirm next steps

(Template created by LifeLabs Learning. Feel free to copy, paste, and alter to match your org.)
Message 1 (Invitation to full team):
Dear team,
In light of the recent violent acts of racism but also a resurgence of hope for equity and inclusion in our
country, we want to use this energy to turn our focus inward and be the change we want to see.
We are assembling a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Task Force, and want to invite you to join.
Who: ​We’re looking for 6-10 coworkers with diverse perspectives, identities, roles and a passion for
diversity, equity, and inclusion. We will give ERG/Affinity group leaders first priority given their
history of dedication to equity in our organization. If we have more than 10 people interested, all
others can help the task force by submitting ideas and providing feedback.
What: ​The task force will conduct an audit of our systems and norms (e.g., interviewing,
performance assessment, meetings) and propose a plan to our People Ops and Executive teams.
Participating in the task force will require 2-4 hours per week for 4 weeks. We will ask managers to
help task force members adjust their workload, if needed, during this time.
Why: ​As humans, our brains are wired for bias. This means that we have to be intentional and
systematic about welcoming diversity and establishing equity and inclusion. An even more inclusive
culture means we can all bring our best selves to work and co-create a more just society.
When: ​If you are interested, please respond to this email by [DATE]. We will select task force
members by [DATE], and you will have 4 weeks to gather information and present their plan. We will
then follow up within 2 weeks with our approved 2020 plan.

How: ​Please respond to this email if you’re interested. Let us know (1) why you want to join the task
force, (2) what specialized DEI knowledge you might have - though expertise is not required.

Message 2A (Instructions for taskforce):
Hello, everyone. Thank you for applying to join our DEI task force! We would love for you to join.
Here are the next steps:
●

I’ve scheduled a 60 minute kick off meeting on xx date.

●

We will use this first session to get to know one another and review the ​Inclusion Audit Tool​.

●

In our second meeting we will decide how we will distribute workload across the task force (e.g.,
work together bucket by bucket or assign different buckets to different people).

●

To assess each bucket of the Inclusion Audit Tool, we will ask our People Team and Executive
Team questions and interview our employees (starting first with consultants in our #inclusion Slack
channel who have volunteered to help the task force).

●

We will generate ideas together, ideally pulling for feedback and suggestions from #inclusion
consultants. Ask: “who else might be impacted?” and “whose perspective haven’t we considered?”

●

Based on our findings, we will develop a proposal for actions we can take as an organization in the
short-term (within the next 2 months), medium-term (within 2020), and long-term (2021+).

●

We will present our assessment and recommendations to the People and Executive Teams on
[DATE].

Please reach out at any time for clarification, further guidance, or if you need help making workload
adjustments to take on this responsibility. Thank you for helping us keep improving and living our values!
Message 2B (Instructions for others):
Hello, everyone. Thank you for applying to join our DEI task force! We’ve had so much interest from the
team (hooray!) that all slots have already been filled.
That said, we would love to learn from your ideas and feedback. We will be starting a special temporary
Slack channel #inclusion that you can join to provide input for the task force. Please stay tuned for an
invitation. If you have questions or suggestions in the meantime, please let us know. And thank you again
for your willingness to help us keep improving and living our values!

Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are organizationally sponsored groups formed around specific shared
identities (e.g., Black, BIPOC, women, queer folks, veterans, parents). They can increase employee
engagement, productivity, candidate interest, and retention while leading to business innovation and
growth. ​That said, if they are not set up well, they can also lead to out-group friction, burnout,
perceived unfairness, and in some cases even discrimination lawsuits.
There is no one right way to set up your ERG. The format and guidelines should be different depending on
the ​goals ​you are looking to achieve. Make sure your ERG has defined its primary goal, and is aware of
pros/ cons/ and mitigations for each goal.

TEAM DIALOGUE GUIDES

Context: After difficult societal events, what kinds of public forums can be created for employees to
share, compress, and process what is happening? Our suggestion is that companies should help
teams create skilled facilitators for these discussions, since they are needed and important.
Tips:
●

●

Open the conversation by sharing that
○ conversations like this are hard and are needed
○ the goal for today is to be there for each other
○ the goal for this conversation isn’t action. It is understanding.
○ today doesn’t have to be the only conversation - we can take it as a starting point.
Wrap the conversation:
○ By reconnecting with the purpose and common goal of belonging and understanding.
○ Share that although these conversations are hard, our commitment is to caring for one
another.

Sample guidelines to provide for all:
● Use “I” statements: ​Speak from your own experience instead of generalizing ("I" instead of "they,"
"we," and "you"). Instead of invalidating somebody else's story with your own spin on their
experience, share your own story and experience.
● The goal is not to agree - it is to gain a deeper understanding. ​Please remember that everyone
is coping with these events in a different way, and everyone's feelings are valid even if they're
different from yours.
● Listen deeply. ​Respect others when they are talking. It is vital to approach the topic of [race] with
respect for its weightiness and nuance, centuries of pain and oppression, multiple perspectives and
narratives, and the person(s) you are engaging with.
● Embrace discomfort. ​Discomfort happens because we care.​ ​Don’t let it hold you back. Use it as a
signal to push you to learn more. Be willing to change your mind.
Sample skills for facilitators to use often:

PEOPLE OPS RESOURCES

Over the past months we have hosted three working sessions with over 1000 heads of People. To
see the actual sessions and what is on people’s minds across companies, here are links.

Tools for gaining exec buy-in to DEI initiatives
While a growing number of people are open to and eager for change, People Ops and DEI leaders might still need
to work hard to get the level of buy-in that they need from their stakeholders to make positive change. Below are
terms and concepts that can help you drive change faster!

●

Get a seat at the table: ​If decisions are being made when you’re not present, it’s hard to have
influence. Set up recurring check-ins with decision-makers, ask to join meetings where decisions
are made, and find ways to make the “table” bigger through all-staff meetings and tools like Slack
so more people can fit.

●

Inoculate concerns​: Consider what leadership might be feeling when deciding how much to focus
on DEI. For example, a CEO might be worried that this shift could mean losing control over
company decisions or that dedicated resources to DEI will put the business at risk. Ask questions
to understand decision-makers’ concerns and hopes. For example:
○ “How are you thinking about DEI at our company?”
○ “How do you think it connects to our goals, mission, vision, and values?”
○ “What are your concerns or hesitations?”
○ “What are you hoping we can achieve on the DEI front?”
Next, use this understanding to create an ​inoculation statement​. For example, ​“I recognize that
this change could make you feel like it distracts us from our priorities. I want to roll out our new DEI
strategy in a way that supports our objectives.”

●

Use the 3-Lenses Model​ we teach at LifeLabs Learning to gain influence with leadership by
speaking to the lens that is most relevant to your listener:
○ Lens 1 [Speaker]: “The impact this change will have on me is…”
○ Lens 2 [Listener]: “The impact this will have on you is…”
○ Lens 3 [Company]: “The impact this will have on our company is…”

●

Go on Listening Tours:​ Connect with different people at your organization to understand their
current experience. Show you care while also collecting ‘team pulse’ data.

●

Create a link-map​: When presenting an idea, share how that idea links up to bigger picture goals
or objectives. Ask yourself, “what does this link up to?” For DEI initiatives, it might sound something
like this: ​My plan is to roll out this initiative because it links up to:

Increasing retention of critical talent.​ ​Employees who experience microaggressions​ are
three times more likely to think about leaving their jobs.
Improving the quality of our decision-making. ​Teams with greater diversity and inclusion
make more accurate decisions.
Building greater resonance and trust with customers. ​Treating employees well is the
highest-impact way to communicate an organization’s values and strengthen relationships
with customers.

●

Split-track what you hear:​ If you hear compounding topics in the reply you get, separate them to
reduce misalignment, stay on track, and focus on what matters.​ For example: “I heard you mention
both revenue and culture as concerns. Which is the bigger concern?”

●

Continuity heuristic =​ We have a craving to feel consistent, so if you say, “in the past you said X
was important, do you still feel that way?” people will be more likely to buy-in.

●

Use heart & head statements​: Want your message to be more influential? Speak to the heart
(“imagine if”, metaphors, stories, specific people) and the head (facts and research). ​For example:
“Imagine if every employee felt like they could bring their full selves to work, and we could increase
retention by 40%.”

●

Identify and mitigate risks: ​To assert influence, identify and speak to risks up front (e.g., revenue,
people, culture, brand). Make sure to highlight the areas that may not already be considered. You
want people leaving the conversation saying, “we need to make sure this person joins future
conversations because they are noticing things we are not thinking about!” Next, explain your plan
for how each risk will be alleviated.

Need more support? ​We offer training in influence skills, leading change, and inclusive systems skills.

You can also up your influence skills by joining our free events (​see sidebar​) and ​POPs United Slack Group​.

ANTI-RACISM AND ALLYSHIP RESOURCES
Allyship terms + concepts to know and share
An important part of allyship is understanding the terms that matter. Here is a series of terms shared by
members of our community that help to increase conversational capacity:
●

Privilege: ​an unearned advantage given by society to some people but not all. Recognizing your
own privilege (the ways in which your identity and background have helped you) is a great place to
start since it opens the door to empathy and allows people to become more aware of opportunities
to use their privilege to be better allies.

●

Systemic oppression​: pervasive inequality that is present throughout society, benefits people with
more privilege, and harms those with fewer privileges.

3.B.1.k

●

Marginalized person:​ a member of a group that is impacted by a system of oppression.

●

Ally​: a member of a group that benefits from privilege and works to end oppression for others
and/or make it easier for people with less privilege to gain access to opportunities. Also known as
accomplice.

●

Intersectionality: ​the concept that people can be subject to multiple systems of oppression and/or
privilege that intersect and interact with each other (coined by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw).
For example, someone’s experience can be shaped by being male and cis-gender (privilege) and
also Black and gay (marginalized).

●

Psychological safety​:​ a feeling that someone can share what they are really thinking and feeling
without fear of negative consequences (like loss of physical safety, status, relationships, job).

●

Microaggression​: a statement, action, or incident regarded as an instance of indirect, subtle, or
unintentional expression of a negative stereotype. (Originally coined by Dr. Chester Pierce).

Managers are being asked to support employees as they navigate working from home, exploring White
supremacy, experiencing racism, dealing with a global public health crisis, and so much more. All at once!
There is more pressure on managers now than ever to support, develop, focus, and inspire employees. So,
along with offering ​training​ to set up your managers for success, create a Manager Meetup Program so
they can have each other’s support as they navigate the hardest management challenges of this
generation.
Here are the top tips based on our clients’ most successful programs:
1) Name your program
This simple first step makes your program feel more special (signaling to managers that you are investing in
their development) and makes it easier to talk about and promote. ​Examples: Manager Dens, Leadership
Circles, Manager Meetups, Linked Leaders.
2) Pick a cadence
The most common meetup frequency is monthly, but you might want to poll program participants to learn
what works best for their needs and schedules (e.g., weekly, biweekly, monthly, or quarterly).
3) Create a system
Successful manager meetup programs tend to fall in one of two categories: ​(1) ​create a #leader Slack
channel and use a pairing tool like ​Donut​ to create new, random connections of 2-4 different managers for
each meetup, or ​(2) ​establish a consistent cohort of 8-10 participants that continues meeting for 6-24
months. ​Pro-tip: If your managers completed the LifeLabs Manager CORE program in a cohort, keep this
group together!
4) Decide on your grouping strategy
The most effective programs typically lean on the power of ​random​ groupings for maximum diversity and
simplicity. But you might also consider more deliberate arrangements (e.g., connecting managers of similar
experience levels or forming cross-functional or cross-geographic groups).
5) Provide clear instructions
Take any confusion or friction out of your program by sharing a clear invitation and meeting instructions.
Sample invitation: ​We know how much responsibility is on your shoulders and what a crucial role you play
in helping our teams succeed. Thank you! We want to help make your lives easier (and less lonely) by inviting
you to join our new Linked Leaders Program. Join the #linked Slack channel, and once every month, you’ll
be randomly assigned to connect with 2-4 others managers at COMPANY to share insights and advice. If
you have any questions, please let me know.
Sample meeting instructions:​ Congratulations! You’ve been connected. Right now, find a 60-minute
window to meet this week. Start with a quick round of insight-sharing (2 minutes each), then take turns

discussing your most pressing manager challenge with questions and advice from the group (12 minutes
each).

6) Bonus – help new learning stick
If you’re offering manager meetups to people who completed a training program, encourage them to
refresh and apply their new skills.
Sample alternate instructions:​ Congratulations! You’ve been connected. Right now, find a 60-minute
window to meet this week. Start by sharing one skill or tool from the manager skills program that you’ve
used in the past month (2 minutes each). Take turns discussing your most pressing manager challenge with
coaching, feedback, and advice from the group (10 minutes each). Wrap up by committing to one skill or
tool you’ll use next week (2 minutes each). Pro-tip: have your workshop key points handy so you can keep
applying what you learned.

Managers are the hotspot for creating inclusive cultures. When you train managers to have essential DEI
skills, you can quickly see a change sweep across an org. But supporting direct reports through difficult
times, while at the same time coping with one’s own thoughts and feelings is incredibly difficult. Below are
resources for managers - as a first step - to help make it easier to lead with compassion and create a
culture of greater equity and inclusion for all.

MANAGER RESOURCES

Micro-intervention guide
Microaggressions (small comments or actions that reveal or come across as a bias or stereotype) are
unfortunately pervasive in many workplaces. For example, a comment like “Wow! You are so articulate!”
said to a Black coworker might be well-intentioned but when heard over and over from different people can
imply that being articulate and Black is a surprising combination. A single comment is typically easy to cope
with but chronic exposure to similar remarks can lead to stress, disengagement, and underperformance.
For managers,​ intervening​ when we see instances of microaggressions is tricky and yet important since
managers play a critical role in modeling desirable behavior and supporting their teams.
When microaggressions happen, ​there's typically a tug-of-war in our brains. “Did it feel upsetting to
others?” “Do I say something right now, publicly, or do I wait and address it privately?” Many factors go
into this decision. Things like, "Would it put me at risk?", "How bad was it?", "Did anyone else notice
that/interpret it that way?", "Is this a good time to educate?", "If I don't say anything, does it signal that this
is okay?" And for managers, the extra layer is, “What does it say about me as a leader or our company
leadership overall?”
There is no right or wrong answer, but here are a few tips from our Behaviors of Inclusion workshop at
LifeLabs Learning for addressing microaggressions and discriminatory behavior, publicly and privately.
PUBLICLY

●

Isolate the sentence or comment. ​If someone says something in public that isn’t okay, you
(in a manager role) can do a micro-intervention. The goal of this micro-intervention is to let it
be known to other listeners that you recognize an inappropriate comment, but to do so in a
way that creates room for change.

●

●

How? Sample public actions include: Pause the conversation by publicly asking ​"Could you
say more about what you mean when you say xyz?", or share: "That sentence/ comment
doesn’t land well with me. Or, ‘I’m worried about that comment. Can I share more with you
later?’ Or “I think that comment would need to be said differently. Can I share more with you
later?”.
The focus is on the comment or the sentence, never the person. This is what we call
‘separating the person from the action’.

PRIVATELY, in a 1-1 conversation
Give feedback using the LifeLabs Q-BIQ method
●
●
●
●
●

●

Q​uestion: Can we talk about what just happened/ the conversation during our last team
meeting?
B​ehavior: Describe what you observed/ heard said.
I​mpact statement: Share why this matters/ How their action/ comment might impact others?
Q​uestion: End with a question to make it a two-way conversation. Help them decide how to
address what happened or what was said.
Remember to separate the intent from the impact. If the conversation turns to a reaction like
“but I didn’t mean it,” acknowledge that intention and impact are separate and yet the impact
is real regardless of intention.
It can also be helpful to frame what you're sharing. For example, "Hey, this is uncomfortable
for me to say, but I know you care about the team feeling like they belong, so ..." Framing can
help set up the conversation for success.

4 ACTIONS TO TAKE DURING CRITICAL RACISM MOMENTS
Responding to racism and strengthening inclusion

1. Send A Message From Your Company, sharing your reaction and values
Why send a message?
●

Silence sends an unintended signal, leaving employees to interpret it in their own way - often
seeing no message as a sign of disinterest, fear, or lack of care. Inaction is still action.

●

Asking employees to be real, present, and authentic at work goes hand-in-hand with
acknowledging and making space for the very real impact of events outside of work.

●

This message is an opportunity to give especially impacted employees a greater sense of safety
and belonging, and all employees a greater sense of meaning and pride in their organization,
increasing loyalty and engagement.

What should go in internal (employee) messaging?
❏ Acknowledge​ the current situation​ ​(see samples below)​,​ ideally naming victims by name and
acknowledging the disproportionate impact on Black team members.
❏ Normalize ​the strain of doing work and staying present in the midst of violence ​and​ a pandemic.
❏ Promote mental health and self-care ​by encouraging taking time off, taking breaks, sharing
what’s on your mind, opting out of conversations if needed, and redistributing workload.
❏ Unite​ your team with a connection to your company missions and/or values.
❏ Commit to action ​by clarifying how your organization will play a role in building a more equitable
and inclusive company and society (e.g., make a donation, have a “blackout day,” roll out
inclusion/allyship training, launch a ​DEI task force​). Adjust your messaging based on the actions
you decide to take in the buckets below.
Most important: ​Take any commitment you make ​seriously. ​Vague promises or promises without
concrete action can lead to greater disengagement. Once you send your message, create a concrete
plan with owners for each action.
Who should send a message?
● A message from the CEO and/or founder sends the strongest signal (​see sample​ CEO messages
and a ​template​ for encouraging CEOs/founders to speak up).
● People Ops should ideally follow up with more detailed employee resources for all employees
and a message to managers​ (​see sample below​) ​with recommended actions to take.
● Managers should ideally send a follow-up message to their teams offering support.

Here are four buckets of action to prioritize (created June 1, 2020):

3.B.1.k

Employees are under an unprecedented amount of chronic cognitive and emotional strain. Prioritizing
mental health now will increase your team’s resilience and capacity to make meaningful contributions in
the long-term.
Offer mental health services
● Clarify existing mental health benefits. Pro-tip: make these very simple to access.
● Offer extra Mental Health Days.
● Provide additional services (e.g., TalkSpace subscription.)
● See our ​Resilience Playbook​ for additional recommendations.
Create spaces for cognitive offloading/processing
● Create a dedicated Slack channel for conversations.
● Make time to process in the beginning of all-hands and team meetings (e.g., do a 2-minute round
robin to give people a chance to express what they’re feeling to create shared
awareness/empathy). Include an opt-out or pass option for those who do not want to participate.
● Ask managers to “check in before checking on” - ask about feelings and needs at the start of
1-1s (e.g., “What can I do to support you this week?” “What can I take off your plate?”).
● Hold an optional meeting for people to attend to discuss what they’re experiencing.

3. Offer Educational Resources
●

Support your ERG/Affinity groups​ by offering additional education resources and internal
visibility (including self-awareness and allyship/inclusion training).

Share articles, books, podcasts, videos, documentaries, and websites. ​(See resources)
Pro-tip: invite people to share short summaries of key points with links to resources.

4. Take Action To Support Causes that Matter Most
The anger and anxiety in our bodies can be fuel for action with long-lasting positive impact on your
company. Frame the action by acknowledging the context. ​For example: “It may seem reactive, and it is.
As painful as the current situation is, it is also an important reminder to take deliberate action.”
Here are examples of actions you can take right away:
● Launch an educational program (see bucket 3 above for ideas) and ask employees to help
co-create and promote the program.
● Launch a DEI task force to develop a proposal for greater equity and inclusion within your
organization (including how you support employees ​and c
​ ustomers). ​See our task force guide​.
● Match employee donations to organizations that support equity and social justice.

SAMPLE COMMUNICATIONS

From People Ops / HR to managers
(Template written by LifeLabs Learning. Feel free to copy, paste, and edit to match your org.)
Dear managers,
Times are hard right now. We ask our employees to bring their full selves to work so we can all benefit from
the passion, engagement, and creativity that’s only possible when we are real with each other. And right
now, bringing your full self to work also means bringing your fears, your pain, your confusion, and your
anger. The recent killings of George Floyd, Tony McDade, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and violence has
brought pervasive racism into the forefront of our minds. It’s not that racism is new - it is the fact that it is
unending that is so painful.
So, what can we do as leaders in our organization? Here are 3 steps we ask you to take:
1. Put on your oxygen mask first. ​Holding space for others going through emotional turmoil while
also feeling the chronic strain yourself is a lot to endure. Please take care of yourself so you can
also show up for others. Take breaks, take time off, lean on your peers, ask for help, and contact
the People Team if you need extra support.
2. Acknowledge it.​ Call out what’s happening in the world, and the impact it has on your team in an
email and/or in your next team meeting. Make it clear that people can talk about their fears and
frustrations about racism as openly as we have been talking about the pandemic.
Use phrases like: ​“I want to acknowledge what’s happening...”​ ​“I want to call out how impossible it
is sometimes to focus on work in the midst of everything that’s happening…” “It’s okay to talk about
what’s happening in our world and how we’re feeling about it…”
3. Check ​in​ before checking on. ​Every person on your team right now is feeling something different.
Some people are angry. Some people are grieving. Some people are exhausted. Some people need
breaks. Some need help re-prioritizing their work. And some people want to throw themselves into
their work for a sense of progress and meaning. So, start your 1-1s by checking in about how
people are feeling and what they need before checking on their work.
Ask questions like: ​“What’s one thing I can do to make your life easier?” “Have you seen the
resources we have available to help during this time - do you need any clarification?”
Based on what you learn, please help each person make adjustments to their work (e.g., make a
stop-start-continue list, take time off, distribute tasks across the team, share self-care resources
like this ​article​ or a resource you co-create with your team).

The following are sample messages in response to pervasive anti-Black violence that was highlighted by
the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and many others.

If we can support you in any additional way during this time, please let us know. And THANK YOU for your
courage and care as leader during this difficult time.

Hi,
I’m thinking it would mean a lot to our team to hear from you regarding the recent deaths, racism, and
anti-Black violence going on.
It’s also a chance to show our employees we care and stand with them - especially Black employees. It can
go a long way in creating a better space for people to cope.
I’m thinking an email and comment at all-hands would be great. Let me know if I can help by writing up a
draft or sending sample messages from other companies (dozens have already gone out this week).
I know how much is on your plate right now, and would love to make it easier on you. Would a draft help?

From CEOs to team
From Justworks:
The murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police is a horrible crime. The officers on the scene need to be
held accountable. This type of brutality against Black Americans has r​ epeated itself over and over for years​.
Black Lives Matter and we can’t be a nation where all people are created equal unless we recognize,
confront, and eradicate racism.
We’ve been living with structural racism for over 400 years and Black Americans have battled against (and
continue to do so) institutionalized obstacles. Black Americans experience life in an entirely different way
than others. Everyone plays a role, even if they don’t know it. Part of white privilege is the privilege of “not
knowing” and it needs to end now.
Racism and bias are much too prevalent, including in corporate America. This is unacceptable. Justworks is
committing to:
1. Training our people to actively combat racism. More than just “bias training,” we need to actively
undo racism. Everyone at Justworks will complete the initial phase of this training in the next 30
days, with ongoing reinforcement thereafter.
2. Matching employee donations 2:1 to B
​ lack Lives Matter​, ​Know Your Rights Camp,​ and C
​ ampaign
Zero​, or another related cause of the employee’s choice.
3. Waiving 12 months of Justworks admin fees for newly formed Black-owned businesses so that we
can help them get started. Offering a discount to all Black-owned businesses no matter when they
were started.

employees and helping them feel safe in sharing their experiences. Our leadership team is making

5. Creating space for our own employees to get together, grieve, and heal. Space means the venue,
time, and priority; other things will have to wait.
6. Making our leadership ranks and company as a whole more diverse and inclusive. Reporting
internally, and on a weekly basis, the diversity of our recruiting pipeline. Partnering with other
organizations to ensure that we have a diverse pipeline for every role. Taking a close look at all of
our hiring practices and training our hiring managers to eliminate bias. Ensuring that Black
employees have a solid career path at Justworks.
7. Encouraging and expecting our employees to take time off to recharge, protest, or for any other
reason. Closing Justworks on Friday, June 5, 2020, so that our entire team can do just that.
8. Refusing to do business with people who harass, intimidate, bully or abuse our people. Encouraging
our people to speak up about misconduct and not tolerating retaliation.
9. Expanding the scope and influence of our DEI team, and growing the team. Posting the first job
online in the next week.
10. Compensating our Employee Resource Group (ERG) leads for the additional work that they are
putting into our company, effective June 1st.
11. Incorporating this action plan, and other actions that we identify, into our goal-setting and
accountability (OKR) frameworks.
12. Amplifying our black-owned business customers.
In addition to these actions, which are things that we will do within Justworks, we also call on President
Trump to stop making public statements which divide people and incite hatred, and instead to use his
presidency to bring our nation together and promote reconciliation.
We call on Congress to pass ​H.R. 40,​ legislation that would create a commission to study the effects of
slavery and discrimination from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate remedies.
We call on state lawmakers nationwide to compel police departments to adopt reforms and enact policy
changes recommended by the ​2015 report​ of the Task Force on 21st Century Policing commissioned by the
White House.
Finally, we call on New York State lawmakers to repeal s​ ection 50-a of the New York Civil Rights Law​ which
prohibits inspection or review of police officer personnel records without their consent. Governor Cuomo
has indicated that he would sign this into law.

themselves available to all of our employees to listen 1:1. Experimenting with other forms of shared
space so that employees feel safe and heard no matter how they prefer to communicate. Staying
connected to what everyone on our team is experiencing and acting on that feedback. Our first
survey will be in the next 15 days.

We all need to listen carefully to each other, and to our fellow Black Americans in particular. Our nation and
our people are angry, frustrated, sad and hurting. Until we begin to truly take steps to show that we hear, we
will not be able to begin healing.

Excerpt from Acutis:
I want to share my thoughts on the most recent murder of George Floyd. Floyd’s final words – “I can’t
breathe,” “Mama,” and “please” follow many more words we will never hear from Ahmaud Arbery, Sandra
Bland and Breonna Taylor. Their deaths add to a much longer history of violence and racism Black people
and people of color have faced. Voices demanding justice must be heard.
Our team, from the most junior to more senior members, is made up of amazing colleagues from across all
races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs. This is what makes us special. I love that about you all. I want to
make sure that we continue to make progress together.
We will, as Acutis, make a donation this week to the Liberty Fund, which is an assistance program for
people who are jailed because they don’t have the personal funds to raise bail. I encourage you all to follow
our action with a donation of any size.
We will continue to work for, celebrate and protect our diversity so that our work place is a place of
acceptance and hope for all. All. We will be clear in our position about the importance of such social justice.
Most importantly, I will ask for ideas and input on what more we can do. You have my commitment that we
will be at our best. The most recent tragedies have come at a time when we’ve been trying to heal from the
COVID19 crisis. You all have been #HealthCareHeros. You stepped in, stepped up and saved lives. We will
step in and step up for social justice.
From GoFund Me:
Over the last week, people across the country have stood up in the face of injustice and systemic racism
plaguing the black community. We've seen an outpouring of global support on GoFundMe for George
Floyd’s family, peaceful protesters demanding change, and organizations fighting for equality and
accountability.
The issues people are voicing are deep-rooted and require meaningful change. We understand that t​ o drive
change we must get involved and take action​. To help drive that change, today we’ve created the ​Justice &
Equality Fund​ to support organizations and people that are dedicated to addressing both urgent needs and
systemic problems. We have committed ​$500,000​ to start the Fund, which will initially focus on bail, racial
justice, and law enforcement reform.
Solving the deep, structural issues that have caused these nationwide protests will take empathy and
dedication. We are committed to a sustained effort to create change and look forward to working with you
to help our society become more equitable.

From European Wax Center:

Over the past few weeks, the associates of European Wax Center have come together to find a way we can generate
positive change within our organization and within our communities in direct response to the senseless deaths of
George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and countless others. We are having open and frank conversations with
our Black associates, guests, partners and friends about how we can join the fight against systemic racism, inequality,
and injustice – a pandemic that has plagued the United States for centuries.
Our first step toward driving change is actively listening. All EWC associates are being asked for their passion and
participation, because having the full support of our entire company makes the likelihood of success that much greater
and we aim to present a united front. Although our EWC family is a diverse one, it’s imperative that we lift up the voices
of our Black associates and collectively bear witness to their personal stories. Injustices they have experienced in their
career and personal lives are truths we all need to hear and acknowledge, so that we, as an organization, can fuel real
change and continue to create a company culture that embraces diversity and inclusion.
To help guide us, we are creating a Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council to spearhead the development of thoughtful
internal and external initiatives that promote racial equality such as community engagement, new recruiting efforts and
performance management metrics to help continue fostering the kind of working environment where associates feel
represented, supported and heard.
We also want to take a deeper look at the ways prejudice and fear can manifest in the workplace. That means
uncovering our own biases that, if not confronted, can cause harm to others. So both our executive leadership team and
associates will participate in Unconscious Bias training, which requires that we take a deep and honest look at our
actions and motivations. This training will certainly impact the positivity and inclusivity of our workplace, but our hope is
that it does more—and touches each of our associates in personal ways that inspires them to take this new
understanding out into their respective communities and enact it in their everyday life.
We also want to be deliberate how we contribute financially to any cause, because we believe that money alone cannot
and should not absolve us from taking meaningful action. Together, with our Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council we
are researching grassroots causes that address a myriad of issues that disproportionally affect Black communities, such
as education and community health + wellness, to determine the best approach.
Additionally, we are recommitting to and reinforcing our Anti-Discrimination Policy. Although this policy is not new for
us, we want to make it clear to our entire company and network that our actions will follow our words. Period.
For us, this is not instituting a policy or two and being done. We recognize that confronting racism extends beyond the
Black community, and we remain resolute in focusing on all racial diversity as we go forward. Today, we want our Black
leaders and associates to know we’re going to continually stand with them as fierce allies.
Now is not the time to stand idly by. It is the time to be vocal, staunch allies, and do so in the caring spirit that has
always led us. We’re appreciative of our guests, their feedback to us, and of the honest and thoughtful suggestions of
how we can do more to promote equality from within.
In Solidarity,
The EWC Team
