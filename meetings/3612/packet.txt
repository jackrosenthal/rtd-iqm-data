BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Revenue Diversification Working Group Presentation

March 12, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors held a Retreat on March 25, 2023, which resulted in a policy goal seeking to
shore up RTD’s financial position by creating a long-term, sustainable, and resilient funding model for the
agency.
During the Tuesday, May 9, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, Director Erik Davidson and
the Chief Financial Officer presented a Discussion Item regarding a Board revenue diversification policy
goal, which included a discussion of RTD’s revenue portfolio as well as proposed activities to mitigate
the financial risks associated with reliance on a limited number of funding sources.
On August 22, 2023, the General Manager and CEO informed the Board of a Revenue Diversification
Working Group, via memorandum, that was to be assembled to investigate revenue diversification and
other financial risk mitigation strategies to recommend to the Board.
Participants in this Revenue Diversification Working Group include:
• Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
• Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
• Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
• Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
• Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
• Erik Davidson, Director, District I
DISCUSSION
The Revenue Diversification Working Group began monthly meetings in October 2023 and has met on
six occasions thus far as well as having several smaller breakout group meetings.
Meetings have primarily involved completing and discussing results of research activities, engaging with
a polling consultant, and developing a communications strategy.
The attached presentation materials provide an update regarding the activities of the Revenue
Diversification Working Group.

• Increase the probability that if one revenue stream declines, another is
available

• Access to diverse external subsidies will allow RTD to better handle
year-to-year changes in revenue

TABOR Overview and RTD
§ In 1992, voters approved an amendment to the Colorado Constitution known as the Taxpayer’s
Bill of Rights (TABOR)

§ Voters exempted RTD in 1995 from TABOR’s limitations through December 31, 2005
• In 1999, voters further exempted RTD from those limitations for the purpose of paying debt incurred to
finance the construction of the Southeast and Southwest light rail lines or to operate such, for as long
as any bond debt remains outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026

• RTD’s bonds will be repaid in November 2024, and de-Brucing on 0.6% sales and use tax will expire at that time

§ In 2004, voters authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to 1%,
effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program

• When all FasTracks bond debt is repaid in 2050, 0.4% sales and use tax rate may be reduced, and deBrucing on 0.4% expires

COMMITTEE WORKPLAN APPROVAL
Committee Meeting Date:
Approval of the 2024 Finance and Planning Committee
Work Plan

March 12, 2024

COMMITTEE ACTION
For the Finance and Planning Committee to approve the 2024 Committee Work Plan.
REPRESENTATIVE
Doug Tisdale, Chair, Finance and Planning Committee
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the January 30, 2024, regular Board meeting, the Board of Directors approved a Bylaws
amendment calling for each standing committee of the Board to draft and approve an annual work plan.
The work plan before the committee will cover meetings from April 2024 through February 2025.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Per the Board Bylaws, Article VI, Section 1d, the Finance and Planning Committee (Committee) “is
responsible for agency financial matters, including but not limited to budget and monthly financial
statement review, determination of the fiscal impact of all Board actions, asset management, and longrange planning and capital projects.”
DISCUSSION
The Committee discussed matters related to the work plan during its January 16, 2024, meeting and
again at the Board retreat on February 27, 2024. Additionally, the Committee Chair and Vice Chair have
coordinated with the General Manager and CEO and the Chief Financial Officer on this work plan.
Directors are asked to review and make any additional changes to the work plan before voting to
approve it.

Packet Pg. 32

1.E.1

Once approved by the Committee, the work plan will be forwarded to the full Board for review. The
approved work plan may be adjusted by the Committee Chair in consultation with the Committee Vice
Chair and responsible RTD staff.
This discussion and approval align with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer
Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Committee’s ability to effectively govern
directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. An organized committee work plan will ensure
RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are more
focused, collaborative, and obtainable.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Account-based Ticketing Contract Extension

March 12, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In October 2020, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to contract 16DH050 regarding Mobile
Ticketing with Masabi, LLC (Masabi) to provide the software and support necessary for adding AccountBased Ticketing (ABT) functionality. Masabi implemented ABT enhancing the RTD Mobile Ticketing app
(now branded RTD MyRide app) and activating back-office software functionality in its JustRide platform
for fare payment with stored value, CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood EcoPass. Masabi also
implemented integrations with RTD’s bus Computer Aided Dispatch/Automatic Vehicle Location
(CAD/AVL) system, the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the Auraria Higher Education Center. Use of
Masabi’s JustRide platform for mobile ticketing and ABT has been successful, and Masabi has proven to
be a competent and responsive vendor.
Mobile Ticketing is a convenient fare payment method that has proven to be very popular with RTD
customers. Customers can purchase RTD mobile tickets in the RTD MyRide app and, through
integrations by Masabi, also in the Transit and Uber third-party apps. In addition, employers,
organizations and event organizers can issue mobile tickets to customers in bulk.
ABT functionality allows customers to ride with stored value, CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood
EcoPass. The system processes and stores information by account, allowing for such benefits as realtime loading and availability of funds and fare payment and account balance information, tap-to-ride
functionality, fare capping (customers are automatically charged the most cost-efficient fare), the ability
to use barcodes and other fare media in addition to cards, the ability for multiple riders to use the fund
balance in the same account, varied means of loading stored value, more fare offerings and flexibility in
changing fares, and less maintenance through utilization of a hosted environment, all while also ensuring
Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance. Employers, institutions of higher education, and neighborhoods
can manage pass program users, barcodes, and cards in the JustRide system. The Masabi fare collection
system is scalable and allows for modifications such as the recent implementation of fare changes
resulting from the 2022-23 Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis. This system also provides
flexibility regarding potential future fare structure changes and enhancements as well as compatibility
with other electronic fare collection systems such as ticket vending machines, and the capability to
integrate with other third-party systems.

1.F.1

The Masabi contract currently requires a fixed monthly payment of $150,000 for ongoing use of the
JustRide platform for mobile ticketing and account-based ticketing and support. These costs are
approximately 4% to 5% of associated fare revenue, which is comparable to costs incurred with other
fare collection providers in the industry. In addition, payment transactions that are completed with a
credit or debit card through the Masabi system also result in an additional cost of approximately 4.7% of
card sales, which is paid to banks and card processing networks such as Visa and Mastercard and
passed through at cost from Masabi to RTD.
DISCUSSION
A sole source extension of this contract with Masabi would continue the provision of the JustRide
mobile ticketing and ABT functionality for an additional two-years following expiration of the existing
contract in June 2024.
During this two-year period, staff will be evaluating the agency’s fare collection systems for potential
enhancements and integrations in a holistic manner and to provide further alignment with the Strategic
Priorities. This will inform a competitive procurement for mobile ticketing and ABT software and support,
to be implemented at the conclusion of this recommended two-year contract extension.
The extension of this contract will include a 5% increase in the current monthly fixed payment of
$150,000 to $157,500 in June 2024 and to $165,375 in June 2025, in recognition of inflation during
2022, 2023, and 2024 as well as additional client support that will be provided.
Masabi has performed very well under the current contract by providing excellent customer service,
meeting contractual requirements for system availability and PCI compliance. In addition, Masabi has
been responsive and effective at implementing changes such as during the Zero Fare for Better Air
period, New Year’s Eve Zero Fare, and the implementation of 2024 fare and fare structure changes.
Further, Masabi has assigned a dedicated account manager and customer success manager to RTD. As
such, during the April meeting cycle, staff will bring for the Board’s consideration a recommended action
to authorize the two-year extension.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this two-year extension is a not-to-exceed amount of $3,874,500 in fixed costs
and an estimated $3,000,000 in card payment processing costs for a total not-to-exceed amount of
$6,874,500. The 2024 Budget approved by the Board in November 2023 includes funding for these
costs.
