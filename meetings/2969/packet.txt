Subject:

2020 - 2022 Granite Paver Maintenance
Contract for 16th Street Mall Transitway Lanes

General

Board Meeting Date: February 6, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his or her designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute
the three-year contract for 16th Street Mall Granite Paver Maintenance with Colorado Custom Rock
Corporation, in the dollar amount of $3,565,821. Funding for the first year of this action is $1,100,000
and is included in the 2020 Adopted Budget.
This recommendation supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Enhance Current and Future Transportation Methods
BACKGROUND
The Free Mall Ride bus service connects Denver Union Station and Civic Center Plaza, and carried
approximately 32,000 passengers per weekday in 2019 on the 16th Street in Downtown Denver
(“Mall”). A portion of the Mall, from Civic Center Plaza to Market Street was built in 1982 with granite
pavers as the surfacing materials. The right-of-way is owned by the City and County of Denver (CCD),
but RTD took on the maintenance of the Transitway pavers in 1984. Under the terms of an existing
inter-governmental agreement (IGA), RTD is required to provide maintenance on the Transitway pavers
until December 31, 2022.
From 2017 through 2019, RTD spent $3,289,549 in direct costs for repairing the Transitway pavers.
Repairing the pavers also includes part time effort of several staff members in addition to the direct cost.
In 2013, CCD committed to participate in the cost of granite paver maintenance and pay RTD 30% of
the annual paver maintenance cost, up to an annual maximum of $300,000, for a period of ten years.
In 2015 and 2016, RTD staff led an environmental clearance effort to evaluate different paving material
alternatives for the Transitway. In 2017, a broader vision for the Mall came under consideration, to
make the Mall a place to go to, in addition to going though. The Downtown Denver Partnership and
CCD are working to make the Mall a destination and a welcoming place for everyone in the heart of a
vibrant downtown. As part of realizing the vision, the transit lanes will be moved towards the center,
and the Mall will be rebuilt with granite paving in a manner that addresses historic problems, such as the
slippery surface, and inadequate drainage, and enhances public life.
Release of the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the reconstruction project for public review, and the
framework for construction and maintenance agreements was approved by the RTD Board on June 26,
2018. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was issued by the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) on November 26, 2019, thus completing the EA process. RTD is committing the federal funds
from two FTA grants previously awarded to RTD for rehabilitation of the Transitway (provided that FTA

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

approves changes to the scope of those grants), as well as RTD’s 1/3 share of the Local Match to the
grants. The remaining funds for these two grants total $14,802,501, and require a 20% local match.
CCD is proceeding with developing plans, specifications, and a Request for Proposals. CCD intends to
obtain a five year warranty for the transit way from the contractor building the Project. RTD will make
payments of $100,000 each year during the warranty period in to a reserve account and 30% of
incurred maintenance costs thereafter, up to $100,000 per year.
The earliest ground disturbance expected is in the first half of 2021. Construction is expected to last at
least three years.
The construction and maintenance IGAs will need Denver City Council approval.
DISCUSSION
This contract provides granite paver repair, replacement and/or maintenance within the 16th Street Mall
Transitway between Broadway and Market Street. The contract was advertised as a Request for
Proposals (RFP), or best value contract. Proposals were evaluated on Experience of the Firm and Key
Individuals (25%), Understanding/Approach/Organization (25%), and Cost (50%). Colorado Custom
Rock Corporation was deemed responsive and responsible and found to be the best value proposal.
Granite pavers are purchased by RTD on a separate contract with Cold Spring Granite and furnished to
the mall paver maintenance contractor for installation.
The best value proposer is Colorado Custom Rock Corporation for the three-year contract amount of
$3,565,821. The only other firm to propose was PCL Construction with a three year cost of
$6,412,012.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The RTD 2020 Adopted Budget includes $1,100,000 to fund the first year of this contract. Funding for
the remaining two years of the contract will be included in the 2021-2026 Mid-Term Financial Plan.
This Project is funded from local dollars, including the $300,000 annual contribution from the City and
County of Denver.
This is a work order contract, so the actual expenditures will vary depending on the amount of repair
work needed over the term of the contract. These expenditures will decrease after the Mall
reconstruction project begins.
DBE/SBE GOAL
The Small Business Office reviewed the scope of work, and established a zero percent SBE goal, due to
the specialized work involved. Colorado Custom Rock is an SBE firm.
ALTERNATIVES
1 Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his or her
designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute the three-year contract for 16th Street
Mall Granite Paver Maintenance with Colorado Custom Rock Corporation, in the dollar amount of
$ $3,565,821. Funding for the first year of this action is $1,100,000 and is included in the 2020
Adopted Budget.
2

Do not accept the recommended action. Allow the Transitway pavers to fall into disrepair, which
may lead to trip hazards for pedestrians, and potentially cause damage to the buses. This will

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

lead RTD to reroute or discontinue the Free Mall Ride bus service and also violate terms of the
IGA with the CCD.
3

Resolicit the work. This is not recommended as historically we have only had a couple of firms
bid on this work.

Key Peer Findings

Attachment: Reiamgine RTD Update to Board (4094 : Reimagine RTD)

DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE

• RTD is the largest service area and has the lowest population density
of any of the peers. Only half the population density of the next least
dense peer.
• The majority of transit ridership at RTD, like the peer group average,
is carried on bus service.
• RTD provides more service per resident (both bus service and rail
service) than our peers.
• Ridership per revenue hour on rail service is lower than the peer
average and is lower than all peers except San Jose.
• Otherwise RTD is essentially comparable on the other metrics.
