PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Boulder County Commissioner Will Toor presented the Board with a letter from US 36
Mayors/Commissioners Coalition (MCC). He shared that given that there was no specific plan
to go to the voters for an increase in revenues for FasTracks, the US 36 MCC would like to
communicate to the Board the following investment priorities for the corridor.
o Include remaining 2004 FasTracks funding for the US36 BRT of $92M in ($82M for
BRT and $10M for bikeway) capital funding in the early years.
o Include operational funding for BRT when the US 36 managed lanes open in 2015
o Include funding for Quiet Zones in the corridor/improvements with independent utility
that are consistent with the FasTracks vision, such as quiet zones and station development
that serve BRT and rail.
o Commit funding for the environmental work to evaluate and develop accurate costs of
individual segments for the NW Rail and/or other possible cost effective options.
Honorable Mayor Applebaum, Boulder, provided comments dittoing the statements by
Commissioner Toor. Mayor Applebaum focuses on the criticality of these projects getting
completed in a timely manner to coincide with the managed lanes completion. He spoke to
the importance of the BRT as providing mobility in the corridor for a long time to come. He
also talked about the need for regional equity as RTD considers its prioritization of projects to
pursue.
Audrey DeBarros, US 36 Commuting Solutions, spoke to the item K, authorization to enter
into agreement with 36 Commuting Solutions and to amend contract with Scheidt &
Bachmann for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit Ticket Vending machines. Audrey indicated this was
paid for out of a FASTER grant as part of a collaborative effort. This is a grant with local
match funds.
Ace King, transit research, spoke to the undeveloped retail space at University Station. He
noted not any of this retail space is being used and he asked RTD to finish the space so the
taxpayers will realize a value from their taxpayer investment.
Kenny Shephard, Denver, spoke to the type of buses being used by RTD and requested we
look at replacing some of these buses with coaches that are more comfortable. He also
requested signage in the rear on the 1900 & 2800 series fleet.

was a good conference and he learned a lot especially in the SBE/DBE session hosted
by the FTA. Director McMullen concurred and stated he was impressed by the
cleanliness of the union station. During a tour of their rail system, he had the
opportunity to speak to a rider who was genuinely surprised to be asked by an elected
official of her thoughts. He expressed RTD has a very transparent and open
communications with our constituents.
Director Anderson stated it is apparent that RTD system is more user friendly. RTD is
recognized as a leading agency throughout the country.
General Manager Washington noted that in the opening session from the podium, the
early opening of the West Corridor was talked about and how this project is ahead of
schedule.
 Chair Kemp thanked the staff for providing the BRT display for the community to see.
Even though many of the features were community centered and lots of comments
on the aesthetics were received, this gave some ideas on what a BRT bus might look
like. The features are changeable.
 The telephone town hall meetings have been interesting and successful. Director
Bagley stated it is a fantastic opportunity to reach constituents. Director McMullen
added this is one of the best communication vehicles yet-money well spent.
 Juneteenth Celebration in Five Points—Chair Kemp indicated that Director Deadwyler
had participated in the Juneteenth Celebration and asked for comments. Director
Deadwyler reported this was a great success with over 300 people visiting the RTD
booth. She gave special thanks to Joni Goheen and Michelle Brier, PI Communications
Team, Christina (Pinky) Smith-TIC and Paula Perdue and Erin Klaas from the Board
office. Director McMullen also stopped by. RTD gave out lots of prizes and provided
lots of information on our bus routing and FasTracks program.
 Director Malpiede was profiled as RTD Board member of the year. Director Malpiede
is very active in the community and spends lots of time outreaching to her
constituents.
 Upcoming events- Board members will be attending the Northwest Rail and Sheridan
Garage groundbreaking this week. Director Deadwyler will be attending the Board
Members and staff workshop in Atlanta Georgia.
