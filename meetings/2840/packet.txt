Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for February 2019:
1. Colorado City & County Management Association Conference (CCCMA) – I will be
attending the CCCMA Conference on February 7. The CCCMA is a statewide
association of local government managers and the conference provides a great
opportunity to interface with them in a more casual environment. I will loop back with
individual directors regarding any conversations with folks from your jurisdictions.
2. Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) – The Metro Mayors Caucus will hold its first full
caucus meeting of the year on February 6, at the Denver Metro Chamber, 1445 Market
St., Denver, CO 80202.
3. APTA Legislative Conference – I will be attending the APTA Legislative Conference in
March and plan to host a dinner for board members and staff on Monday, March 18
following the Squire Patton Boggs briefing for your visits to the hill the next day. I’m
coordinating with Sherry Ellebracht and the board office regarding logistics.
4. CAC Meetings with Board Members – Thank you for your cooperation in scheduling
one-on-one meeting with members of the Citizens Advisory Committee in the coming
weeks. Earlier this month the Committee completed a Mobile Lab workshop with the
Community Engagement Team focused on 2019 goal setting and members are excited to
share the results and get your input.

Re:

RTD Board Report

BBMK attended a stakeholder meeting on state wide transportation funding solutions. The
meeting was chaired by Representative Chris Hansen and Representative Matt Gray. The
Legislators announced that a bill would be coming in mid to late March and would be carried by
them along with Senators Winter and Zenzinger in the Senate.
SB19-101 by Senator Lundeen Concerning Prerequisites for Construction of Managed Lanes
was introduced and assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee. This bill was offered as
an amendment last year during the Senate floor debate on SB18-001. The bill is opposed by the
Colorado Contractors and the Colorado Department of Transportation as it limits the abilities of
P3’s in infrastructure projects.
HB19-1072 by Rep. McKean Concerning Requiring Traffic Signals Cycle Yellow before Green
will be postponed indefinitely this week by the sponsor. This bill caused RTD staff concerns
from an operational standpoint.
BBMK has assisted staff and coordinated with Rep. Jackson on press inquiries regarding the
motor carriers’ issue with hazardous material transportation on Smith and Chamber’s road.
Since the state legislature to date has rejected their legislative proposals it seems that the group
will now be pursuing federal relief.
BBMK has scheduled several meetings for General Manager Genova with members of the
House and Senate Transportation Committee, leadership and newly elected officials. This is an
excellent opportunity to educate members on the District’s successes and challenges and to
continue to foster relationships at the State Legislature.
BBMK continues to meet with new RTD Board Directors and are working with them to
coordinate legislative meetings. We appreciate working with RTD Directors and staff and look
forward to a busy and productive legislative session.

Federal Update for February 5, 2019, Meeting of Communications and
Government Relations Committee

Federal Government Operations
With all departments and programs of the Federal government funded through February 15,
employees of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) have returned to their jobs. However,
FY 2019 transit apportionments have yet to be made, as FTA normally waits until Congress has
appropriated at least five months of funding before the agency begins distributing formula
funds.
Beyond the suspension of Federal reimbursements, the impacts of the 35-day government shutdown did reach some transit agencies. For example, in Washington DC, WMATA estimates its
loss was about $400,000 per weekday as a result of reduced ridership by Federal employees and
contractors.
House Infrastructure Priorities in the 116 th Congress
All signs continue to indicate that legislative action on infrastructure this year will begin in the
House, not the Senate. House Transportation and Infrastructure (T & I) Committee Chairman
Peter DeFazio (D-OR) has made clear his priorities for the 116 th Congress, which include moving
a broad, well-funded infrastructure bill through the House in the first six months of the year and
securing a genuine revenue solution for the Highway Trust Fund. Now House T & I Ranking
Member Sam Graves (R-MO) and his senior staff have begun to outline publicly their own
infrastructure priorities. Rep. Graves has called for President Trump to address infrastructure
in his State of the Union (SOTU) address, citing the President’s leadership as essential to jumpstarting Republican momentum for a bill.
Republican Strategy for Infrastructure
Minority staff for the Committee have further outlined the Republican infrastructure strategy,
echoing that Trump’s engagement is crucial. Presidential leadership will give Congressional
Republicans the political cover to take some tough votes, such as ones to increase tax revenues
or restore earmarks. House Republicans are therefore working with both the White House and

US DOT to make infrastructure a focus of the President’s SOTU address to show that the
Administration is serious about getting an infrastructure bill done.

The T & I Committee was the most-requested committee assignment of the 116 th Congress
because it is viewed by both parties as a place “to get things done.” As a result, membership on
the Committee has been increased to 67 members, making it the largest committee in the
House. Colorado, however, continues its dry spell here, as no member of the Colorado
delegation was appointed to the T & I Committee for the 116 th Congress.
House T & I Committee’s Early Agenda and Schedule
The T & I Committee will focus first on a large, multi-modal infrastructure bill, and Chairman
DeFazio has an ambitious schedule for advancing it. He has secured time in May for
consideration of that bill on the House floor, so Committee consideration of the bill would likely
take place in April. The Committee has tentatively identified February 7 as the date of its broad
kick-off hearing on infrastructure.
Ranking Member Graves shares the Chairman’s support for earmarking funds for projects in
Members’ districts, so we anticipate debate soon in the House on whether to revive earmarking.
DeFazio and Graves both recognize that raising the gas tax is the most efficient means of raising
revenues in the short term, but both see a vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) fee as the best longterm, sustainable revenue source. So we expect to see a nationwide VMT pilot program in their
infrastructure bill, to help establish a clear path to a national VMT fee.
Beyond an infrastructure bill and then the reauthorization of surface transportation programs
by FY 2021, the T & I Committee will examine transportation’s role in climate change. The
Committee’s priorities will undoubtedly take more substantive shape in the weeks and months
ahead.

In terms of the T & I Committee’s approach, Graves’ staff said that both Graves and DeFazio are
committed to continuing the longstanding practice of advancing bipartisan bills under “big four”
agreements, where only provisions garnering the support of the Chairs and Ranking Members of
the full committee and relevant subcommittee are included in the bill.
