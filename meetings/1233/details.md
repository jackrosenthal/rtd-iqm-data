It is recommended by the RTD Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement (for federal liaison services) with Patton Boggs LLP to exercise a one-year option (February 1, 2014 through January 31, 2015) to extend Contract No. 19-DX-001, at a cost of $258,000.  Funding for this contract is included in the 2014 budget.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to consider items 1 and 2 together and have one vote to move these items forward to the full Board at the November 26th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, stated that these actions are to renew our federal liaison contract with Patton Boggs and our local liaison contract with CRL.   She said this would be the fourth year option for Patton Boggs; next year RTD will go out with an RFP.  Sherry Ellebracht noted this would be the second year option for CRL out of four.

Sherry Ellebracht explained that she did not invite anyone to come because there was such a lengthy agenda.  She commented that Patton Boggs will be at the December committee meeting to give their annual update to the Board.

Committee Chair Daly stated that Roger Sherman gave his apologies for not being able to attend; however there was a lot of political activity and he needed to stay informed.

Committee Chair Daly declared the motion PASSED unanimously.
