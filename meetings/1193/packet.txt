BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 3, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

Date:

Board Meeting Date: July 9, 2013

Subject:

2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policies states that “RTD will prepare and update
annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed to
support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal and
interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District.
The other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time
period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have
adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
The SBP provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal funding. RTD
cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are included in the TIP.
The 2014-2019 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2014-2019 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2013 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and
best estimates. The SBP is being presented to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee on
July 9th with a staff recommendation for Board adoption on July 16th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2014-2019 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2013 Amended Budget. The column titled “Amended Budget 2013” in Exhibit I incorporates
revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections both the
June sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School, and reductions, eliminations or deferrals of
SBP requested projects. No service reductions are proposed in the SBP through this period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2014-2019 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $113.7 million in 2014 is forecast to decrease by $2.4 million
from 2013 due to transfer of revenue (and ridership) from bus to the West
Line. This represents ridership revenue that West Line has gained and bus has
lost. In future years, fare revenue includes a 10% farebox rate increase in
2015 and 2017 per Board policy of an optional 10% fare rate increase every 3
years.
 Sales and use tax incorporates the June quarterly update from the CU-Leeds
School of Business for the years 2013-2019.
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, and
recent congressional actions.
 Fixed guideway and capital maintenance grant revenue is increased at the area
CPI inflation rates (from the CLC) with a doubling of fixed guideway grant
revenue (additional $8.7 million) in 2014 resulting from the seven-year
operating anniversary of the Southeast corridor.
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates of 2.3% in 2014 and 2.4% in
2015-2019. Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated
amount through 2017 then escalated at the CPI rate.
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base
System, will be held at the 2013 level in 2014, and beginning with 2014 increased
by the CPI rate serially each year.
 Specifically identified operating and maintenance projects are included (Exhibit III).
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in
investable balances.
 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each
year by using amortization tables. Projected interest payments on future debt issues
are based on current municipal rate forward curves. Interest payment assumptions
incorporate recent upticks in interest rates on the forward curve.
 Capital expenditures include all anticipated and specifically identified capital projects
and replacements (Exhibit II).
 Per Board policy that established a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund, staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund and/or capital
replacement fund be maintained at a minimum $3.0 million each year until each fund
reaches the minimum target balance of $30 million, projected to occur no later than
2019. During 2017, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to reach
$30 million.
 Contributions to fund balances include the Base System’s FISA contribution from sale
of Civic Center air rights.
 Debt issued represents COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition. Debt
payments are derived from debt amortization schedules.
 Non-cash items include the estimated year-end net pension obligation offset by yearend accruals.

Note: The CLC inflation rate (CPI) is 2.3% in 2014 and 2.4% in 2015-2019, while the national CPI (applied
to fuel) is 2.5% in 2014-2019.

Exhibit II
Exhibit II is a detailed listing of planned capital projects during the SBP period. Copies are available
in the Board office for review.
Exhibit III
Exhibit III is a detailed listing of planned operating, maintenance and administrative projects during
the SBP period. Copies are available in the Board office for review.
Exhibit IV
Exhibit IV is a listing of deferred capital and operating projects that were submitted for
consideration during the SBP development process but are excluded from the 2014-2019 SBP at
this time. Copies are available in the Board office for review.
The planned capital and expense projects are totaled below, inflated at the CPI rate starting in
2014 (in millions).

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
Impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance in each year of the SBP. However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax
revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an
impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the 2014
budget period.
Current key financial indicators for the SBP are (in millions):

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2014-2019 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by
staff and the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2014-2019 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the
SBP identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2014 budget

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

process and adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for
the 2014 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2014-2019
SBP. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible
delay in the 2014 budget process.

Per the U.S. Department of Transportation guidance and regulations, all recipients
of federal financial assistance must comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 •and its related laws and regulations. As a recipient of federal financial
assistance, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) submits an annual assurance
of compliance with Title VI as a part of RTD’s annual submission of Certifications
and Assurances, as required per 49 CFR part 21.7. Accordingly, RTD’s Planning
Department will review the district’s services in its entirety for compliance with
Title VI. This review will include a review of the Strategic Budget Plan as
necessary, pursuant to ensuring non-discrimination on basis of race, color and
national origin. Should any Title VI violations become evident, remedial and/or
mitigating measures will be developed to restore equity and achieve compliance
with Title VI.

BroncosRide 2013 Update

There will be two distinct differences in the BroncosRide service for the 2013 season that should be
pointed out:
First, the new West Line will provide service to Sports Authority Field at Mile High via the new DecaturFederal Station. Although it has been general practice to discontinue BroncosRide bus service from Light
Rail Stations, RTD will keep the Federal Center Station BroncosRide for the 2013 season in order to
evaluate the West Line service capacity to the Stadium on game days. A decision on the continuation of
the Federal Center Station BroncosRide will be made after the 2013 Broncos season.
Second, the BroncosRide service has previously included the Federal Shuttle. The Federal Shuttle has
two elements: a south shuttle for customers parking at Lincoln High School and a north shuttle for
customers parking at Chase Bank at Lakeside Office Park. Ridership on each shuttle ranges between
250-300 customers per game. For the Broncos 2013 season, the north portion of the shuttle will not
operate as Lakeside’s previous commitment to RTD’s BroncosRide parking has changed. Unfortunately,
there is no alternative for customer parking along Federal Boulevard for the north shuttle. RTD Marketing
materials will direct the customers to Ward Road or Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Rides for BroncosRide
service. Therefore, for the 2013 Broncos season, the revised Federal Shuttle routing will only include
the south shuttle which will operate from Lincoln High School to Decatur-Federal Station for access to
the Stadium.

Status
The system continues to have high severity problems reoccur
on a regular basis. RTD is requesting a Senior Central
System Engineer from INIT to be onsite. The 60-day minifleet test was halted and will not restart until high-severity
problems are resolved. Therefore, testing will continue into
September.
890 buses are installed with 114 remaining. Projections still
show August completion. Installations still projecting to
complete at the end of August. But, there is risk of not
completing until early September.
Fourteen Street Supervisor vehicles have been installed.
ASA drive testing went well. The length of messages may be
a problem on shorter blocks. Modifications of announcements
are being considered to adjust for this limitation.
Asset management interfaces are going through detailed
testing that will extend into July.
A downstream data management interface is being
developed.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Smart Card Program continues to effectively gather rider taps for bus and train EcoPass and
CollegePass riders. During the month of June, 2013, 993K taps were recorded on bus and train
validators, an expected continued reduction from May due to a decrease in college pass use as many
colleges and universities are on summer break. The Smartcard Customer Service Center, (Operated
under an RTD contract with Xerox by Celina, Inc.) continues to distribute new cards upon request, issue
replacement cards and answer riders’ questions as they arise.
A team of RTD Technical Support staff meets weekly to discuss reported issues with bus installations
and determine steps required to address issues that arise. A work effort is under way to repair/replace
defective stanchions on which the Smart Card readers are mounted.
All one-hundred-nine Light Rail validators have been installed and are operational. Work on the
installation of two additional validators at 16th/California and 18th/California has been completed. An RFP
(Request for Proposal) has been published to retain a work order contractor to provide on-call installation
and electrical services for additional validators as needed. Review of the responses to the proposal is
scheduled for July 9, 2013.
An update to the Fare Inspector software used to confirm that passengers have tapped prior to boarding
is expected to be delivered on July 8, 2013. Once complete, the upgrade to the hand-held devices will
provide an extended battery life for the unit, as well as display more comprehensive messaging regarding
suspended cards. Xerox is engaged in additional work to simplify the method by which software
upgrades are applied to the hand held devices. Fare Inspectors continue to operate in an “educate &

As part of the Phase 2 Smart Card deployment, detailed testing plans have been developed to fully test
the Retail Point of Sales (RPOS) Terminals that were delivered to RTD in May. Phase 2 will see the
implementation of these terminals at RTD sales locations and will provide the general public with the
ability to purchase Smart Card products. The detailed testing scenarios are designed to ensure a
seamless integration of the point-of sale units into the existing Smart Media Technology platform. A
review of the Retailer’s Agreement/Application will take place on July 17, 2013. RTD Marketing staff
will meet with Safeway and King Soopers after a contract is signed to develop the appropriate marketing
campaign. In addition to the web portal already in place, approximately 150 locations will be established
throughout the region for riders to purchase monthly passes and/or add value to their cards. Planning for
Phase 2 of the program is in full-swing and the schedule continues to be evaluated to ensure adequate
timing for a successful Phase 2 launch.

Marketing has completed their review of the SMT web
portal. A meeting has been scheduled for July 11, 2013
during which Marketing will review the requested changes
to the portal. These changes will be developed into
requirements which will be presented to Xerox for
completion. Marketing has provided advanced information
that there are a large number of changes to be reviewed
and discussed. Some of these changes are “cosmetic” in
nature regarding the appearance of the web portal. Others
may require changes to the functionality of the portal
itself. A more detailed description of the impact to the
portal will be provided in the August Board Report.
The Upload/Suspend functionality was thoroughly tested
and performs as expected in the test environment. The
new software was moved into production on Thursday,
5/30/13. At present, colleges and universities are
continuing to work through the process of suspending and
deactivating college passes. RTD has scheduled one-onone meetings with the larger schools and universities to
offer assistance as they prepare their records for upload
into the Smart Card system. At these meetings, RTD staff
will assess the current status of College Pass programs at
each location and provide support where needed to get
cards suspended or deactivated as appropriate.

Meeting with King Soopers held in early March. They have
indicated they would like to avoid their busy months of
November and December for implementation and training
of their staff. Installations of the units may be done during
this time as long as the work is done during the overnight
hours.
No response from 7-Eleven; may possibly pursue a
partnership with Walgreens.
Design document has been approved. RTD will provide a
cellular modem for communication to the RTD network.
All 300 RPOS Units were delivered to RTD on time.
Network installations at all RTD Retail outlets have been
completed and the sites are ready for RPOS installation at
the appropriate time.
Testing on the new RPOS units is tentatively scheduled for
the Week of July 15. Xerox will be onsite for testing and
test plans have been developed and reviewed by the
extended project team.
The SMT Program Team continues to look for additional
retail partnerships and outlets.
The printers associated with the APOS devices are

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: July 3, 2013

From:

William Van Meter, Assistant General Manager,
Planning

GM

Date:

July 2, 2013

Board Meeting Date: July 9, 2013

Subject:

2013 Title VI Service Monitoring

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of Directors review and approve the
2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and the future monitoring on an annual basis, to comply with
federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply
with 49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (Title VI). Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin from
recipients of federal financial assistance (grants, loans, etc...). RTD complies with Title VI by
committing to the following guiding principles:
1. Ensure that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are equitably
distributed without regard to race, color, or national origin;
2. Preserve the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services, providing equal access for any
person without regard to race, color or national origin;
3. Create opportunities for the public to participate in transit planning and decision-making without
regard to race, color or national origin;
4. Select the location of transit services and facilities without regard to race, color or national origin;
and
5. Take prompt and immediate action to correct and remediate disparate impacts borne by any
group of people of a race, color, or national origin.
The Title VI Service Monitoring Program is one of the mechanisms used to follow these guiding
principles.
DISCUSSION
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, as an operator of 50 or more fixed route vehicles in peak service, which is
located in an urbanized area, RTD is required to monitor the application of its service standards and
policies with respect to fixed route service. To determine if service standards and policies are adhered to
indiscriminately, the service provided to minority populations is compared to service provided to nonminority populations as required by FTA guidance. The 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results report
describes the scope, method and results of RTD’s Service Monitoring. The FTA also requires transit
providers to officially establish the frequency in which Title VI Service Monitoring will occur. Future Title

Packet Pg. 30

3.B.1

VI Service Monitoring will occur and be reported annually, as a part of the Service Performance Report
presented by Service Development.
The highlights and action items resulting from the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring are summarized in
the presentation attached to this board report. The full report is available separately in the Board Office
for review.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and annual monitoring frequency do not
result in any direct or foreseeable financial impacts.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board
of Directors review and approve the 2013 Title VI Service Monitoring Results and the future
monitoring on an annual basis, to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
2) Do not accept the recommended action. This is not recommended as it could jeopardize current
and future federal funding.
