Jeanette Scarpino explained that final 2012 budget adjustments include a $10.7
million service adjustment, a fuel lock of $2.73 a gallon and gas budgeted at $3.40 a
gallon. We expect revenue to decrease $14.1 million from year end 2011 based on
reductions in grant revenue, investment income and fare box revenue offset by sales
and use tax which is set budgeted to increase 3.9% or $16.3 million from 2011.
Director Tobiassen asked what is in the New Capital for the Base System. Terry
Howerter explained that the MCI coaches will be replaced. Jeannette Scarpino added
that the estimated cost is $26.4 million for the 47 inner city buses.
Director Tayer noted that the Board had some very challenging budget and service
optimization discussions. Part of the challenge was incorporation of what were the
more difficult parts of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations. Those
were the things that allowed us to do the more conservative budgeting and to
increase our reserves. All of those things will benefit us in the long term. Ultimately,
now, we can look forward to a more positive discussion as we look at the other
elements of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force which are the revenue generation and
service efficiency enhancements opportunities.
Committee Chair James added that the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force did a great
job of taking a challenging process and making it easier by bringing outside
stakeholders into the process.
Motion:

Director Tayer made the motion to
forward this item to the full Board at
the November 22, 2011 Board
Meeting.

Second:

Director Tobiassen seconded the
motion.

Information
 Third Quarter Internal Audit Report
Bill Holmes asked if the Board had any questions or comments regarding this Internal
Audit Report, but there were none. Mr. Holmes added that we are on schedule to
finish the 2011 Audit on time. Also, if any of the Board of Directors had any
information requests, issues or questions for the 2012 Audit they should email him
directly as soon as possible. Director Tayer requested Bill to forward an electronic
copy of the schedule to the Board.
 Third Quarter Investment Report
Teresa Sedmak noted that the Third Quarter Investment Report was included in the
packet. Interest rates are extremely low and continue to remain low and the Fed has
indicated that rates will continue to be low for the next couple of years to boost a
very struggling economy.
 Annual Report to the Board
Teresa Sedmak explained that internal to the Swap Policy is a review and annual
review by the Board of the policy. There are no recommended changes to the policy
at this time.
 2011 Performance Report Third Quarter
Jeannette Scarpino indicated that we are seeing the same exceptions in the third
quarter that we saw in the second quarter of 2011. Generally there is improvement
in these areas and we hope to see improvement in the fourth quarter.
Director Daly noted that the Operator Complaints per boarding for the past two
quarters are blank.
Bruce Abel explained that we have had data validating issues and while we work on
the reporting system, we have left those fields blank. For example, if a person calls in
to complain that the bus was late, the driver was rude and there was a fare dispute
would that be three complaints, or one. These are the kinds of things we are trying
to disaggregate out of the system at this point.
Director McMullen asked if that example would be three complaints or one. General
Manager Washington noted that it would be one.
Chair Kemp noted that the preventive maintenance by Veolia is steadily progressing
in the right direction. They are certainly working hard to keep this positive trend
moving forward.

Bruce Abel further noted that with regards to on time performance, due to our
financial situation, we have not had the resources to adjust schedules to improve ontime performance except for the most problematic routes (such as the B in the
January run board). We expect this to get worse with the January run board as there
were a number of routes that have on-time performance problems that we could not
address due to the magnitude of the service reductions necessary for the 2012
budget.
 September 2011 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod indicated that the Dashboard indicates that ridership is flat both
month and year to date from 2010. Sales and use taxes are right where we expected
them to be and we should end the year on track with the SBP numbers.
III.

Other Matters
Committee Chair James noted the he recently attended the Colorado Commercial Real
Estate Expo which took place last week and General Manager Washington was a speaker
on the panel.
Terry Howerter added that we have been working with General Counsel and our state
lobbyists to draft an Act to improve collection of sales taxes for the district. We should
have further input on this in the near term.
Director Daly noted that the operator of the recent rail accident visited the young woman
who was injured in the hospital and thought that was very complementary. While the
legal department might disagree, the hospital visit showed the sincerity and concern of
our rail operator.
General Manager Washington indicated that we have waited to visit the hospital since
the accident is still under investigation. Our plan is to eventually visit the hospital and we
have also reached out to the operator who was very distraught.
Director Bagley added that he had watched a show on CNBC regarding place making
transit oriented development in which RTD was featured.
General Manager Washington explained that tomorrow is the TREX 5th Anniversary
Celebration. We will all be there and Chair Kemp and Director O’Boyle will be speaking.
