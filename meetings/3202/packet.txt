BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
RTD Board’s Position on HB21-1186 Reflecting
Accountability Committee’s Legislative Recommendations

Committee Meeting Date:
March 9, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
March 9, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board to adopt a resolution in support of House Bill 21-1186 titled CONCERNING RELIEVING
THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT OF STATUTORY RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO THE
DISTRICT'S OPERATIONS.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On June 16, 2020, the RTD Board of Directors unanimously approved a Proposal creating the
independent Accountability Committee in collaboration with the Governor of Colorado and the
Transportation Chairs of the General Assembly. The purpose of the Committee is to provide an
independent and objective analysis of RTD's operations. In January 2021, the Accountability Committee
issued a Preliminary Report that made initial legislative recommendations for consideration by the
Colorado General Assembly. RTD staff worked closely with the Accountability Committee and the bill
sponsors to provide information and technical input, resulting in HB21-1186 .
DISCUSSION
HB21-1186 proposes several amendments to RTD’s enabling statute in order to provide RTD with
greater flexibility in its operations and revenue generation, and more meaningfully track and report on its
cost efficiency of services provided.
HB21-1186 removes the cap on the amount of all vehicular service RTD can allow to be provided by
third parties under competitive contracts and retains the 58% cap on the amount of fixed route bus
service that may be provided through such contracts. Additionally, the proposed legislation expands the
types of entities RTD may contract with to include non-profit organizations and local governments.
These amendments provide RTD with more flexibility to implement cost-effective mobility solutions
when appropriate.
Second, HB21-1186 repeals the farebox recovery ratio which currently requires that 30% of RTD’s
operating costs be funded by revenues collected. The amendments require RTD to include in its annual
financial reports information on operating costs, ridership numbers, and operating costs divided by
ridership as a measure of cost efficiency of it services.
Third, HB21-1186 eliminates prohibitions on parking reductions associated with residential and
commercial developments at RTD transfer facilities.
Lastly, HB21-1186 removes restrictions related to RTD’s ability to charge fees and manage parking at
RTD parking facilities.

efficiently, economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Amendment to RTD Code of Ethics on Board of Director’s
Financial Disclosures

Committee Meeting Date:
January 21, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
March 9, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt an amendment to the RTD Code of Ethics to provide that the annual
disclosure form for each elected or appointed RTD Director shall be a public record and shall be open for
inspection by any person.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors adopted a Code of Ethics on February 27, 2018 (the “Code”), applicable to
all employees. The Code includes standards for integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and
sustainability. It also sets forth certain restrictions on employees who have responsibility for
procurements or who are engaged in the award or administration of contracts, and generally prohibits
RTD from entering into contracts with such employees or with a person or entity in which the employee
has an interest.
The Code includes an Annual Disclosure requirement for employees responsible for procurements or
engaged in the award or administration of contracts. This disclosure form is submitted to the General
Counsel and maintained as a confidential personnel record of the employee. The disclosures are used to
create a list of those persons or entities with whom RTD may be restricted from doing business. The
Proposed transactions are compared with the list to see if there are relationships that could cause a
conflict of interest, in which case the General Counsel and Senior Manager of Materials Manager
consult.
DISCUSSION
RTD Directors are considered employees and are subject to the Annual Disclosure requirement. Recently,
each of the Directors provided consent to release their individual Annual Disclosure form in response to
Colorado Open Records requests. The Board Executive Committee suggests that the Code be amended
to provide that the Annual Disclosure forms for each elected or appointed RTD Director be a public
record open for inspection by any person. This will authorize RTD to release this information without
requesting a Director’s consent.

A.

Introduction

This RTD Code of Ethics provides mandatory standards and guidance on ethical behavior
and choices for all of us at RTD: our employees and directors. We will use this Code of Ethics to
guide our daily decisions and actions.
All of us at RTD are expected to be ethical role models. We must all be alert to potential
ethical issues and be ready to respond appropriately. We must avoid conduct that creates an
appearance of impropriety to a reasonable person. Those of us who supervise others must
foster an atmosphere that encourages everyone to seek help if faced with ethical dilemmas.
Responsibility for compliance with standards for ethical conduct ultimately rests with each one
of us.
A key goal of this Code is to promote integrity by preventing conflicts of interest.
Conflicts between our RTD roles and our private interests, whether real or perceived, must be
avoided.
This Code also supports an environment at RTD of honesty, trust, inclusivity and
sustainability: a just culture with sincere, respectful and open communications.
This Code contains five main parts. The first part identifies five basic ethics standards
that apply to all of us at RTD. The second part contains rules limiting RTD contracts with
current and former RTD employees who have responsibility for or influence upon procurement
decisions, including all RTD managers and directors. The third part concerns annual disclosures
by those with responsibility for procurement decisions. The fourth part explains how to get
advice about the Code and states how RTD enforces the Code, including penalties for violation.
The fifth part provides more resources to help interpret the Code, including citations to relevant
legal standards.
The rules in this Code are simple, reasonable, and grounded in common
sense. This Code clearly states expectations for all RTD employees. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of this Code will not be accepted.
No code of ethics can anticipate every possible situation, and this Code of Ethics does
not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply. We must be familiar and
comply with all laws, standards and rules related to our specific jobs. To help in applying the
rules in this Code, RTD’s General Counsel will issue comments and examples applying the Code
to situations that may come up. These comments and examples will be approved by the Senior
Leadership Team as official RTD procedures. In addition, RTD provides ethics training and
resources to apply this Code to situations you are likely to encounter. If you are ever unsure
whether anything you do may violate this Code, contact RTD’s General Counsel for a written
advisory opinion before you take action.
This 2018 revision of RTD’s Code of Ethics was led by an RTD Leadership Academy team
RTD Code of Ethics (2/27/2018)

comments from others, the Code of Ethics was approved and adopted by RTD’s Board of
Directors on February 27, 2018.

B.

Five Basic Ethics Standards for All of Us at RTD

This part of the Code contains five basic ethics standards that apply to each of us: all
RTD employees regardless of position, plus RTD directors (also referred to as “employees” in
this part). These standards are: integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability.

1. Integrity
We will avoid conflicts of interest and promote public confidence in the
integrity of RTD’s decisions.
1.1. We will not engage in outside business or activities that unduly interfere with
official RTD duties and responsibilities, or in official RTD duties and
responsibilities that directly impact an employee’s outside business or activities.
1.2. We will be impartial in carrying out our duties, and will avoid actions that create
an appearance of impropriety to a reasonable person.
1.3. We will not use our positions for personal gain or private benefit, whether for
ourselves or for our families, acquaintances, or businesses.
1.4. We will not offer, or give in response to solicitation, any item of monetary value
to anyone from whom we are seeking official action.
1.5. No director, officer, employee, or agent of RTD will have an interest in any
contract or transaction with RTD except in his or her official representative
capacity.
1.6. RTD’s officers, employees, agents, or board members will neither solicit nor
accept gifts, gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors,
potential contractors, or parties to subcontracts unless the financial interest is
not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. For
purposes of determining whether monetary value is “not substantial” or of
“nominal intrinsic value,” RTD applies the current dollar limits in Colorado

with such employees, or with such former employees within one year of termination of
employment.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
June 2021 Service Change

Committee Meeting Date:
March 9, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jessie Carter, Acting Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Board of Directors holds a bi-monthly Communications and
Government Relations Committee meeting. The meeting is an opportunity for the Communications
Department staff to provide the Board with an overview of communications activities and progress,
highlighting matters of interest to Board members. Staff and the Board also engage in dialogue and staff
fields questions or clarifies information as necessary.
At the February 2, 2021 committee meeting staff shared with the Board the plan to launch an
overarching enhanced approach to stakeholder engagement across the agency, as a continuous effort to
foster open dialogue. This is an opportunity for the Board and staff to hear directly from key
stakeholders on RTD matters that matter most to them. One aspect is conducting a round of stakeholder
engagement sessions at the beginning of each service change process to hear feedback from
stakeholders about RTD service in their communities. The stakeholder listening phase is in addition to
the public listening phase, which will begin this month as part of the June service change process. Both
the stakeholder feedback and the public input will help inform RTD’s future service plans.
DISCUSSION
System ridership remains significantly lower than pre-COVID levels, affected by low commuter activity
and employment center occupancy. Public health orders remain in a protective posture and the agency’s
COVID 19 service plan levels are reflective of the current challenges facing the District.
While system ridership remains relatively unchanged, a review of ridership at the route/line level does
support increases and adjustments to some route services showing higher levels of ridership.
Additionally, system maintenance to improve on-time performance and service reliability is needed on
both bus and rail services. The proposals herein, contain a mix of service enhancements and adjustments
that address transit system connectivity and contract compliance, while maintaining the necessary
resource capacity to support social distancing on the transit network.
It is intended that the service adjustments proposed to the current COVID 19 service plan be adopted as
further modification to the initial COVID service plan implemented April 19, 2020 and modified in
January 2021. Many of the routes proposed for service improvements serve vulnerable communities that
rely on transit. These customers often perform essential jobs and have continued to ride during the
pandemic.
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

Packet Pg. 43

2.C.2

•
•
•
•

The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID induced economic slowdown, the overarching
guidance for the proposed June 2021 service changes come from the Board adopted guidance for
COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Access-a-Ride Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC)
Report

Committee Meeting Date:
March 9, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes

BACKGROUND
In the early 1990s the Regional Transportation District (RTD) established the ADA Paratransit Advisory
Committee (APAC) to promote i t s effective, efficient, and customer-responsive paratransit services
known as Access-a-Ride.
APAC members engage in dialog with RTD staff on issues, trends, needs, policies, and resources
pertaining to Access-a-Ride services throughout the District and offer a unique perspective with the goal
of continuously improving those services. Paratransit is a demand-responsive transit service required by
the Americans with Disabilities Act. APAC provides input to RTD that is intended to:
• Improve the quality and accessibility of Access-a-Ride services.
• Advance the needs of the disabled customers who rely on Access-a-Ride services.
• Strengthen communication between RTD and organizations that advocate for the needs of
Access-a-Ride customers.
• Promote collaboration, transparency, and information sharing.
• Ensure meaningful and diverse community input, participation, and involvement in RTD’s
paratransit-related activities.

DISCUSSION
Brenda Carney, an APAC member, will provide a summary from the January 12, 2021 APAC meeting
and will be available to answer questions.

Public Comment: Non-APAC members in attendance may provide 3-minute input (information to
the APAC, not a discussion with APAC).
No public comment.
II.

Update: Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD) Meeting – Brenda Carney, APAC
liaison
ACPD meeting was November 19, 2020, 2-4pm online and phone. The meeting included:
• Two ADA hero awarded.
• High-Block Access Discussion – RTD initially blocked access to them for non-ADA needs, then, due
to a lot of complaints, started a pilot to allow use of the ADA high-blocks to access light-rail cars
for strollers, bicycles, and wheeled-luggage. RTD is working to ensure priority use of the highblocks is for people with disabilities, and, once on the train car, access to and in the area for ADA
use remains clear and available. The discussion was spirited. Some ACPD members felt their input
wasn’t being taken seriously, while others acknowledged there was a need for non-disability
wheeled access to train cars (particularly for strollers that cannot easily be lifted up the stairs).
Two ACPD members spoke of their experience of not being able to access the high-block. ACPD
will send RTD ideas on the implementation of high-block access policies.
• 16th Street Mall Reconstruction Project Discussion – City/County of Denver is considering two
possible candidates for the design-build contract.
• Vehicle Operator Barriers for COVID Protection – 100% of the barriers will be installed by the end
of 2020. RTD is not expecting to remove the operator barriers if/when the COVID risk decreases.
III.

Updates:

Membership – Jody Erikson, JSE Associates (facilitator)

Malia Munson has changed jobs (from DRMAC) and stepped down from APAC. DRMAC will stay engaged
with APAC; they will attend individual APAC meetings as public, and their ACPD representatives will
attend the joint meetings APAC&ACPD meetings.

Mobile App/Web Portal – Brandon Fowler, RTD
Since the mobile app/web portal went live in October 2020, RTD has continued to get suggestions for
improvements. Small ones are done immediately, more significant changes will get additional beta testing
by volunteers.

Online meetings and call

2.C.3.a

Some of the bigger improvements for beta testing includes:
• Ability to manually enter a pick-up or drop-off location (currently, one can only choose those on
their ‘favorites’ list). The manually entered location will not be automatically added to customers’
‘favorites’ list, but will be easily accessible on the “frequently used” list. The system will check if
the location is within the boundaries, and will be marked “under review” to ensure RTD staff can
review if the address is in the boundaries.
• Showing expected pay for any upcoming trips on the schedule tab (including quests).
• Showing vehicle number on the ETA tab, better for riders to find the right vehicle.
• Showing Access-a-Ride general phone number at the bottom (replacing the RTD customer care
number), as well as the customer care email address.
• Ability to book trips 2-5 days ahead (one more day than currently).
Discussion
• Question: Is the mobile app screen reader accessible?
Answer: Yes, RTD worked to ensure the portal is accessible for screen readers.
• Question: If manually entering a location, how can it be added to my favorites list?
Answer: Put a note in the comment section to have it added, or call to have it added.
• Question: How many locations are allowed on the favorites list?
Answer: The system allows 10 favorite locations.
• SUGGESTION: Update the ETA tab to auto refresh for those with voice over/screen readers
(currently it is not auto refreshing if using screen reader).
ACTION: Volunteers for additional Beta Testing of portal (need to be Access-a-Ride eligible): Current APAC
(3) - Brenda, John, Tex; Past APAC (4) – Becky/Heather Pyle, Brian Novak, James Triplett, Tim Brotzman;
and non-APAC (1) - William Astrada.

RFP for Eligibility and Travel Training Vendor (no process changes/reviews) – Larry Buter, RTD
Last week, RTD released/published the request for proposals (RFP) for a combined eligibility and travel
training vendor. RTD awaits written questions from possible bidders; then RTD will publish questions and
answers. The RTD Board is expected to select a vendor at their March 31, 2021 meeting, with a vendor
start-date of May 1st. The contact will be for 5 years.

Pilot for Combine Access-a-Ride and Fixed-Route Usage – Larry Buter, RTD
RTD has been conducting a pilot to combine paratransit and fixed-route for those who can access fixedroute but need help getting to/from a station/stop. Access-a-Ride takes the rider from a location to the
fixed-route stop/station, and/or from a fixed-route stop/station to a final destination. The pilot is testing
whether this works and whether it helps alleviate pressure on Access-a-Ride schedule at peak times allowing more trips for shorter distances. Often times the location-to-destination could be 20 minutes
(+/-) of travel time on Access-a-Ride, where a ride to a fixed-route stop/station would be 5-7 minutes.
Travel training will include instruction on accessing fixed-route, if that is appropriate.

2.C.3.a
RTD APAC Meeting Summary: January 12, 2021

RTD is still reviewing and developing the extensive detailed list of requirements for any new software
vendor. RTD is considering the needs of both end users - customers and staff, including visually impaired
staff. The expectation is to release the RFP by/in March and award a contract by the end of 2021.
Discussion
• Question: How are accessibility requirements being developed?
Answer: RTD is requiring compliance with all the standards, which will be listed in the RFP.

Pilot for Using Ride-Share Options

In the end of October RTD began a 6-months pilot with Uber/ride-share. This first phase of the pilot is
focused on the areas in the 80013-80016 zip codes (south-east Denver, Aurora, Centennial area) and on
ambulatory customers or those who can fold a wheelchair into a sedan trunk. This focus allows for testing
if the ride-share option would work first. Then, if it works, consider the expanded details necessary to
wheelchair accessibility vehicles (WAVs). This first phase is also testing how much the use of the rideshare option alleviate stress on the system during peak periods.
Thus far, there have been 150 trips in phase one of the pilot. The impact of COVID on this number is not
known, but the guess is that if not for COVID there would have been less ride-share trips.
The second phase of the pilot will focus on the use of WAVs. The expectation is RTD would provide and
operate the WAVs utilized by the ride-share system. RTD is working on developing the details of this
second phase of the pilot.
The third phase will focus on lift-vehicles for fixed wheelchairs.
Discussion
• Question: Are the ride-share drivers getting any ADA training, or is it open to any driver?
Answer: It would be open to any ride-share driver. RTD doesn’t consider the first phase of the
pilot paratransit trips, it is up to the customer to choose the ride-share option.
• Question: Will the ride-share drivers know it is a trip for a person with disabilities?
Answer: It is unknown if the ride-share driver knows. When phase two of the pilot starts, utilizing
RTD WAVs, the driver would know if the WAV was selected by the customer.
• Question: What is the policy for ride-shares about seeing-eye dogs? There are stories of people
being refused a ride because of the dog.
Answer: Uber and Lyft have become more sensitive to seeing-eye dogs (sued in court), and set
policy that a driver cannot refuse a trip based on a seeing-eye dog.
• Question: What/who is responsible for training ride-share drivers about people with disabilities –
there needs to be increased awareness? Example: For the visually impaired customers, drivers
should not expect the customer will see them and walk over.
Answer: RTD is still working out these details and other needs in the first phase of the. When
second phase of the pilot starts, with RTD WAVs, those drivers will have received specific training.
• Question: How is pricing being handled if a customer goes through the ride-share app? Currently
a wheelchair customer has to select Uber XL and the corresponding price increase (seems unfair).

V.

Answer: This is part of conversations during phase one of the pilot, and will be part of any final
agreement developed.
Question: For pricing/payment, will the driver know it is an RTD trip?
Answer: The ride-share option is intended for short trips, and first and/or last mile trips. Once
approved through RTD, Uber will provide the customer a link to book trips as an RTD pilot
participant – the customer would go into the Uber app and then click on/go to the section to
schedule an RTD/Access-a-Ride trip. By going into/clicking on the link Uber will know to charge
the customer $2 and RTD the additional $3-20, and if the trip is more than $22, will charge the
client the overage.
Concern: When booking with Uber or Lyft in the past and picking an accessible vehicle type, it will
say “looking for a ride” over and over and over, leading to missing your appointment, while
thinking a vehicle will be found. It never says “vehicle type not available”, it should say this so the
customer can make alternate plans.
Discussion: What data, information, and/or feedback would APAC members like to get or give in
the coming year?
Pilot of the Access-a-Ride + fixed-route (use of Access-a-Ride for first/last mile).
Travel training.
o Once the eligibility and travel training vendor is contracted, the vendor will come talk
with the APAC about their plan for both.
Denver’s 16th Street reconstruction project, and any public input opportunities.
o Larry will email APAC members if he finds any public input opportunities coming up
before the next APAC meeting.
Colfax investments, will they progress – RTD, Denver.
Central I70 construction impacts on transit in/around the area of northeast Denver.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Internal Audit Activities

Committee Meeting Date:
March 2, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal and IT Audit
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Internal Audit was introduced to the Regional Transportation District in 1979, to enhance and protect
organizational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice and insight. Information
Technology Audit was added to the functions’ responsibility in 2015. The Internal Audit Charter was
introduced in 2015 as a service level agreement with the Board of Directors so that there is a clear
understanding of the role, purpose and position of Internal Audit within the organization and the scope
and nature of its work.
DISCUSSION
Section 32-9-115(3), C.R.S, requires the State Auditor to conduct a performance audit of RTD at least
once every five years. The recent State Audit concluded that RTD has not utilized its Internal Audit unit
to effectively identify and respond to organizational risks. Hence, it was recommended that the agency
improve the internal audit unit's effectiveness and compliance with Internal Audit Standards and
establish procedures and expectations for the unit to be utilized, supervised and evaluated. The results
of the State Audit caused consideration of an independent evaluation of the function with the objective
of addressing the State recommendations while improving the Internal Audit function.
In January, the General Manager and CEO sent a formal request to the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA) requesting a peer review of the agency’s Internal Audit function. The request for
the peer review was received by APTA and recently commenced in mid-February.
An APTA peer review is designed to assist the requesting agency in addressing agency specified issues
through subject matter experts within the transit industry. Coordinated by APTA with the requesting
agency, the subject matter experts, who typically are from peer agencies, convene at the requesting
agency and conduct an intensive review of the issues to be addressed. Due to the pandemic this peer
review will be held virtually.
The peer review typically includes the following:
• Introductory meeting including the peer review panel and agency representatives
• Briefing by agency as to background for the peer review request and issues to be addressed
• Presentations and/or briefings by agency staff
