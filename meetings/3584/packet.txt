BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
GM/CEO Performance Assessment Framework

January 9, 2024

BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Chair, Performance Committee
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the February 15, 2023, Performance Committee (committee) meeting, committee members
reached a consensus that the processes for evaluating both the performance of the General Manager and
Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO) and the performance of the agency itself could be enhanced.
In furtherance of this objective, the committee members reviewed the following materials during the
April 12, 2023, meeting:
• The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan adopted by the Board of Directors on August 10, 2021
• The GM/CEO Employment Agreement (contract) entered into on September 29, 2020, as
amended by the Fourth Amendment agreed to on October 26, 2022
• The Compensation Study Report completed by Gallagher dated November 18, 2022
Further, committee members agreed to explore possible strategies and opportunities to enhance the
criteria and process for evaluating the performance both of the agency and of the GM/CEO.
Per the contract, by November 1 each year, Ms. Johnson shall propose any suggested adjustments to
the Weighted Success Outcomes, Organizational Values, or Goals and the proposed distribution between
base salary and incentive compensation of the Compensation Increase for the Board’s consideration.
After consideration of Ms. Johnson’s proposal and consultation with Ms. Johnson, the Board shall adopt
the Weighted Success Outcomes, Organizational Values, or Goals and the proposed distribution between
base salary and incentive compensation of the Compensation Increase for the next performance period
by December 31.
To allow additional time for the Board to consider Ms. Johnson’s proposal and engage in further
consultation with Ms. Johnson, on December 4, 2023, the Board adopt a fifth amendment to the
contract to adjust the Board’s annual deadline to adopt the goals and metrics upon which Ms. Johnson
will be evaluated in the coming year from December 31 to January 31. This timing also allows newlyelected directors following an election year an opportunity to participate in the goals and metrics
development discussion.
