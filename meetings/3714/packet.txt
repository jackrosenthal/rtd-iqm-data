BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Zero Fares on Transit Equity Day 2025

November 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to
implement zero fares on February 4, 2025 (Transit Equity Day) and to further authorize the annual
implementation of zero-fare day for each Transit Equity Day thereafter.

PRESENTATION LENGTH

BACKGROUND
Transit Equity Day is a National Day of Action to commemorate the birthday of Rosa Parks by declaring
that public transit is a civil right. Rosa Parks, a Black woman, was born on February 4, 1913, in
Tuskegee, Alabama. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested and fined in Montgomery,
Alabama, for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white man, in violation of a city ordinance and
Alabama state law that required segregation on public buses. Following her arrest, Jo Ann Robinson, an
activist during the Civil Rights Movement, and others copied tens of thousands of leaflets and distributed
them across the city calling for a bus boycott. By refusing to comply with Montgomery’s segregation
law, Rosa Parks catalyzed the 381-day bus boycott of the Montgomery bus system by approximately
40,000 customers, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the Montgomery Improvement Association.
On February 1, 1956, a district court case entitled Aurelia S. Browder v. William A. Gayle was filed to
challenge the Alabama state statutes and Montgomery city ordinances requiring segregation on city
buses. On June 5, 1956, the panel ruled two-to-one that segregation on Alabama’s intrastate buses was
unconstitutional. Filed by Fred Gray and Charles D. Langford on behalf of four African American women
(Aurelia S. Browder, Susie McDonald, Claudette Colvin and Mary Louise Smith) who had been
mistreated on city buses, the case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on November 13,
1956, upheld the district court ruling that the statute was unconstitutional. On December 17, 1956, the
Supreme Court rejected city and state appeals to reconsider their decision, and three days later, the
order for integrated buses arrived in Montgomery. On December 20, 1956, the Montgomery
Improvement Association voted to end the 381-day Montgomery bus boycott.
Rosa Parks is widely considered the “Mother of the Freedom Movement” and the “First Lady of Civil
Rights.” The courageous acts of Parks and the four plaintiffs in the Browder v. Gayle case marked an

Packet Pg. 3

important assertion of equal rights for African Americans, women and other marginalized groups in the
United States. Parks was the first woman to join the Montgomery chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), where she served as secretary of the branch and was
later elected secretary of the statewide NAACP. She participated in the 1963 March on Washington and
the Selma to Montgomery March for voting rights in 1965. Parks went on to receive many awards,
including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996. She died in 2005 at the age of 92.
DISCUSSION
First celebrated federally by the U.S. Department of Transportation in 2021, Transit Equity Day
commemorates the life and legacy of iconic civil rights leader Rosa Parks on her birthday. Gaining wider
adoption in 2023, 15 public transit agencies in cities throughout the United States celebrated Transit
Equity Day to promote equity in public transportation and raise awareness about the critical importance
of transit to all members of the community, including the historically underserved. In observance of
Transit Equity Day, many public transportation systems offer no-cost fares for all customers, as well as
host ceremonies with local officials and community-based organizations (e.g., local NAACP branches).
Many leave a seat vacant on buses in honor of Parks. February 4, 2025, would have been Parks’ 112th
birthday. It is important not to consider Rosa Parks as a woman who sat down to “stand up” one day on
a bus, but instead remember her as a woman who stood up every day. The essence of this philosophy is
embodied in Transit Equity Day.
The Board of Directors’ policy adoption to provide system-wide zero-fare transit on Transit Equity Day
would demonstrate the agency’s commitment to the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and
Customer Excellence. Moreover, the Board would honor the legacy of Rosa Parks and other civil rights
pioneers that dedicated their lives to the cause of human rights and truly embodied the love of humanity
and freedom. Transit Equity Day would also serve to recognize the present and future legacies of the
civil rights and social justice movements in Colorado and nationally as well as highlight the
intersectionality of diverse communities, lived experiences and personal identities in the Denver metro
area. Lastly, this would empower communities to enjoy a better quality of life by helping to remove the
limitations of and barriers to mobility and embracing the ideals of Transit Equity Day — on February 4
and throughout the entire year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cumulative annual occurring financial impact to provide zero-fare for transit equity day is
approximately $265,000. The average daily operational cost of providing weekday transit service include
the following:
Fare Revenue Replacement: $239,000 per weekday
Law Enforcement and Security: $11,000 per day
Marketing: up to $15,000 annually

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Centennial State Liquid Investment Pool (CSLIP)
Participation

November 12, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 3, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve RTD’s participation in the Centennial State Liquid Investment Pool
(CSLIP).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2025 Investment Policy (Policy) was approved by the Board on October 22, 2024. The Policy
objectives, in order of priority, are that RTD’s investment activities shall seek safety, liquidity and yield.
Safety of principal ensures that investments seek to preserve value and mitigate risk from losses as well
as credit and interest rate risk. Liquidity means that investments are easily accessible in cash form to
ensure cash flow requirements will be met. Yield seeks market rates for investment returns, taking into
account safety and liquidity. Each of these objectives contributes to RTD being a good steward of
taxpayer funds.
In order to meet these Policy objectives, RTD invests some funds in Colorado Local Government
Investment Pool trust funds (LGIPs). These investment pools are defined in Title 24 of the Colorado
Revised Statutes and are available to all Colorado local governments. LGIPs provide a benefit to
participating governments in the form of economies of scale, full-time portfolio management,
diversification, and liquidity. LGIPS also ensure that investment activity meets state statutory investment
requirements for Colorado local governments.
In addition to RTD’s fixed income investment portfolios, RTD currently invests in three Colorado LGIPS
known as the Colorado Surplus Asset Fund Trust (CSAFE), ColoTrust and the Colorado State Investment
Program (CSIP). Each of these LGIPS have been approved for investment of RTD funds by the RTD
Board. Investing in more than one investment pool provides diversification of RTD’s investments while
also taking advantage of differing investment approaches to ensure the most efficient management of
RTD’s funds.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 6

1.D.2

A new Colorado LGIP, named Centennial State Liquid Investment Pool (CSLIP), was established in May
2024. The primary investment objective of CSLIP is providing a daily liquid cash management and
investment vehicle for Colorado local governments. CSLIP offers a conservative, professionally managed
portfolio consisting of certain allowable investments with the primary objective of preserving principal,
enabling liquidity, maintaining transparency, and maximizing yield. CSLIP seeks to maintain a stable
$1.00 per share Net Asset Value (NAV), meaning that participants’ investments will generally not be
susceptible to price volatility.
CSLIP is rated AAAM by Standard & Poor’s. CSLIP has contracted with State Street Global Advisors as
its registered investment advisor and Eide Bailey as its auditor.
Some of the local governments currently participating in CSLIP include:
• City of Centennial
• Boulder County
• Boulder Valley School District
• Alamosa County
• City of Cherry Hills Village
Staff is seeking Board approval for RTD to become a participant in CSLIP’s portfolio to expand RTD’s
available investment options. Approval would result in RTD’s ability to leverage CSLIP’s investment
approach while also further diversifying RTD’s investments thereby enhancing the safety and liquidity of
funds.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact from this recommended action.

INTRODUCTION
The Colorado Local Government Liquid Asset Trust (“CSLIP” or the “Trust”) was established in 2024
pursuant to Part 7, Article 75, Title 24, C.R.S., known as the Investment Funds - Local Government Pooling
Act (the “Pooling Act”) for the purpose of enabling Colorado local to pool their funds to maximize net
interest earnings. The Trust is a professionally managed local government investment pool trust fund
available only to governmental entities in Colorado.
CSLIP currently offers a single investment portfolio to participating Colorado governments. CSLIP is a
professionally managed portfolio consisting of U.S. Treasury securities, federal instrumentality securities,
agency securities, repurchase agreements, tri-party repurchase agreements, collateralized bank deposits,
commercial paper that, at the time of purchase, is rated in its highest rating category by at least two
nationally recognized organizations which regularly rate such obligations, corporate bonds, and government
money market funds rated “AAAm”. CSLIP aims to maintain a high level of current income while enabling
liquidity and preserving Participant’s capital.
The Trust was created pursuant to the CSLIP Indenture of Trust (the “Indenture”), dated as of May 7, 2024.
Governmental entities that participate in CSLIP are referred to as “Participants” in the Indenture and in this
Information Statement. CSLIP’s Indenture, this Information Statement, Investment Policy, and current
financial statements are publicly available on CSLIP’s webpage: www.cslip.org. Capitalized terms not
defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Indenture.

PARTICIPANTS
CLSIP is available to any Colorado local government that adopts the Indenture and opens an account with
CSLIP. Each local government Participant appoints a designee (each a “Designee”), and all official
communications between the Trust and a Participant are through the designee.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
CSLIP is designed to provide daily liquidity while generating current income and preserving capital for
Colorado governmental entities by investing only in securities that are legal pursuant to the Part 6, Article
75, Title 24, C.R.S. (the “Legal Investments Act”) and Articles 10.5 and 47 of Title 11, C.R.S. (“the Public
Deposit Protection Act”)
CSLIP’s written investment policies permit the Trust to maintain a portion of its assets in U.S. Treasury
securities or repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. It may also invest its assets
in securities of a Federal Farm Credit Bank, a Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Government National Mortgage
Association, and other federal instrumentality or agency security permitted by the Legal Investments Act,
or repurchase agreements collateralized by those securities. CSLIP may also invest in credit obligations
rated in the highest rating category by one or more nationally recognized organizations that regularly rate
such obligations. The policy also provides that CSLIP may not invest more than 5% of its portfolio in the
credit obligations of any single issuer nor may CSLIP own more than 5% of any issuer’s total credit
program. In addition, the portfolio may invest in collateralized bank deposits and “AAAm” rated
government money market funds. The portfolio may invest in securities with a maximum maturity of 397

days for fixed-rate debt and non-sovereign floating-rate debt or 762 days for sovereign government floatingrate debt. The average weighted maturity may not exceed 60 days to reset or 90 days to final maturity.
CSLIP’s organizational documents have been accepted by the Securities Commissioner of the State of
Colorado in accordance with the Local Government Investment Pool Trust Fund Administration and
Enforcement Act (Part 9, Article 51, Title 11, C.R.S.).
CSLIP adheres to the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and operates pursuant to GASB
Statement No. 79, Amortized Cost Basis methodology, for the determination of CSLIP’s transactional share
price(s). CLSIP’s methodology for reporting comports with the rules promulgated by the Colorado
Department of Regulatory Agencies Division of Securities. GASB Statement No. 79’s methodology
exempts Participants from a valuation disclosure required of some fair value funds by GASB Statements
No. 31 and No. 72.
CSLIP anticipates obtaining a rating of “AAAm” by S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”), which is highest rating
provided by S&P. According to S&P’s webpage, an “AAAm” rating is given to issuers that reflect an
“extremely strong capacity to maintain principal stability and limit exposure to principal losses due to credit
market and/or liquidity risks.” These ratings are neither a market rating nor a recommendation to buy, hold,
or sell the securities by the rating agencies.

INCOME ALLOCATIONS
All net income of CSLIP’s portfolio is determined as of the close of business each day (and at such other
times as the Board may determine) and is credited immediately thereafter pro rata to each Participant’s
account. Net income that has thus accrued to the Participants is converted as of the close of business as of
the end of each month into additional shares that are thereafter held in each Participant’s account.
Reinvested net income is converted into full and fractional shares at the rate of one share for each one dollar
credited. Net income for each portfolio each day consists of (1) all accrued interest income on assets of the
portfolio; plus or minus (2) any amortized purchase discount or premium; less (3) accrued expenses.

DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE
The Trust determines the NAV of the shares of CSLIP as of the close of business each day. The NAV per
share of the CSLIP portfolio is computed by dividing the total value of the securities and other assets of the
portfolio, less any liabilities, by the total outstanding shares of the CSLIP portfolio. Liabilities, which
include all expenses and fees of the CSLIP portfolio, are accrued daily.
For the purpose of calculating the NAV per share, the securities held by CSLIP are valued as follows: (1)
securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at valuations provided by
independent pricing agents that utilize methodologies that rely on market data to determine market value;
(2) all other securities and assets are valued at fair market value determined in good faith by the Board in
consultation with their advisors.
The result of this calculation is a share value that is rounded to the nearest penny. Accordingly, the price at
which CSLIP shares are sold and redeemed will not reflect net realized or unrealized gains or losses on
securities that amount to less than $.005 per share. The Trust will endeavor to minimize the amount of such

2
Packet Pg. 13

Attachment: CSLIP-Information-Statement-Revised-8-22-2024 (5020 : Centennial State Liquid Investment Pool (CSLIP) Participation)

1.D.2.b

gains or losses. However, if net unrealized gains or losses should exceed $.005 per share, the NAV per share
will be maintained at $1.00 per share by retention of earnings or the reduction, on a pro rata basis, of each
Participant’s shares in the event of losses or by a pro rata distribution to each Participant in the event of
gains.
CLSIP’s Indenture of Trust provides that CSLIP shall seek to maintain an NAV of $1.00 per share. However,
the NAV may vary from $1.00 per share. The NAV per share of CSLIP may be affected by fluctuations in
interest rates, which in turn may cause increases or decreases in the total value of the securities held by the
Trust. The market value of such securities will generally vary inversely to changes in prevailing interest
rates, meaning that an increase in interest rates from the time a security is purchased may result in a lower
principal value for such security if sold prior to maturity, whereas a decrease in interest rates may result in
a higher principal value. If a security is held to maturity, no loss or gain is normally realized as a result of
fluctuations in interest rates.

DESCRIPTION OF SHARES
The beneficial interests of the Participants in the assets of CSLIP and the earnings thereon are, for
convenience of reference, divided into shares that are used as units to measure the allocation of beneficial
interest among Participants. All shares participate equally in distributions and have equal liquidation and
other rights. The shares have no preference, conversion, exchange, or preemptive rights. For all matters
requiring a vote of Participants pursuant to the terms of CSLIP’s Indenture of Trust, each Participant that
has deposited funds into CSLIP, through its Designee, is entitled to one vote with respect to each such
matter, without regard to the number of shares held by the Participant.

ELIGIBLE INVESTMENTS
The CSLIP portfolio invests in securities that are legal pursuant to the Legal Investments Act and the Public
Deposit Protection Act. For a more complete description of permitted investments please refer to the CSLIP
Investment Policy, available on www.CSLIP.org.

INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS
The Trust may buy and sell and enter into agreements to buy and sell the permitted investments subject to
the restrictions described below. These restrictions are considered to be fundamental to the operation and
activities of the Trust and may not be changed without a majority vote of the Participants.
1. The Trust may not make any investment other than a permitted investment.
2. The Trust may not make any investment other than investments authorized by the Board’s
investment policy, Indenture, or the Legal Investments Act and the Public Deposit Protection Act,
as the same may be amended from time to time; provided, however, the Board and the Trust shall
not be responsible for insuring compliance with any investment restrictions provided for in a
Participant’s home rule charter, investment policy, or elsewhere.
3. The CSLIP portfolio may invest in permitted securities with maximum maturities as outlined by
the Legal Investments Act (Part 6, Article 75, Title 24, C.R.S.).

Packet Pg. 14

Attachment: CSLIP-Information-Statement-Revised-8-22-2024 (5020 : Centennial State Liquid Investment Pool (CSLIP) Participation)

1.D.2.b

4. The Trust may neither borrow money nor incur indebtedness whether or not the proceeds thereof
are intended to be used to purchase permitted investments except as a temporary measure to
facilitate withdrawal requests which might otherwise require unscheduled dispositions of CSLIP
portfolio investments and only as to the extent permitted by law.
5. The Trust may not buy securities from or sell securities to the Fund Administrator, the Board
Administrator, the Investment Advisor, the Custodian, or any member of the Board (Trustee), or
with any affiliate, officer, director, employee, or agent of any of them.
The Trust may not enter into any repurchase agreements for any securities that are not listed as “permitted
investments” in the previous section. In addition, all such agreements must be initially collateralized at
102% and additional securities must be provided if the market value of the collateral falls below 101.5%.

COMPUTATION OF YIELD
The Trust quotes a daily and seven-day average yield for the CSLIP portfolio in reports and information
published by the Trust. To obtain the daily yield, a daily yield factor is first calculated. The factor is the net
income for that day divided by the number of shares outstanding. The factor is then multiplied by 365 (366
in a leap year) to produce the daily yield. The seven-day average yield is obtained by averaging the daily
yield for seven identified, consecutive days. The Trust may also quote the CSLIP portfolio yield from timeto-time on other bases for the information of its Participants.
The yields quoted from time-to-time should not be considered a representation of the yield of the CSLIP
portfolio in the future since the yield is not fixed. Actual yields will depend on various factors, including
but not limited to the credit quality, type of security, potential changes in interest rates, and maturity terms
of the investments held by the Trust as well as potential changes in the expenses of the Trust.

INVESTMENT RISKS
The following is a discussion of certain risks and other factors to be considered in connection with a
prospective investment in the Trust. Prospective Participants should fully understand and evaluate these
risks and other factors, as well as the information set forth elsewhere in this Information Statement, in order
to make an informed investment decision. Each prospective Participant is urged to consult with its own
legal, financial and tax advisors to determine whether an investment in the Trust is appropriate for such
prospective investor. This section is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all risks associated with an
investment in fixed income securities, nor are the risks set forth in this section necessarily presented in
order of relevance, materiality or importance.
Risks Relating to the Credit Profile of CSLIP’s Portfolio. Investors in the Trust are subject to the risk that
an issuer of a fixed-income security held in the Trust will default on the security by failing to pay interest
or principal when due. If such a default occurs, Participants in CSLIP may incur losses. In addition, a decline
in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a
security can cause the price of a such security to decrease. The Investment Advisor will seek to manage
this risk by purchasing high-quality securities as determined by one or more national ratings organizations
and/or the Investment Advisor’s internal credit research team, however, there is guarantee that an event of
default as described herein will not occur.

Packet Pg. 15

1.D.2.b

Risks Relating to Stable Net Asset Value. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of investments
therein at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.
No Insurance or Guaranty. An investment in the Trust is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Neither CSLIP nor its affiliates have any obligation
to provide financial support to the Trust.
Interest Rate and Income Risks. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a fixed-income security to
decrease. Further, a low or negative interest rate environment can adversely affect the Trust’s yield.
Liquidity Risk. The Trust is subject to certain liquidity risks in which the size of a bond’s market, the
frequency of trades, the ease of valuation, and/or issue size may impact the Investment Advisor’s ability to
sell investments in a timely fashion or at or near fair value in order to fulfill a Participant’s redemption
request.
Market Risk. Investments in the Trust are subject to general markets risks, including the risk of rapid and/or
unpredictable fluctuations in the value of the securities held in the Trust, due to factors relating to the
macroeconomy, geopolitical events, the securities markets generally, or industry-specific disruptions.
Risks Related to the Issuer of Securities Held in the Trust. The value of the securities held in the Trust
may decline for reasons directly related to the issuer such as management performance, financial leverage,
and reduced demand for the issuer’s goods or services. It is also possible that a bond issuer (or counterparty)
will default by failing to repay principal and interest in a timely manner.
Suitability. Investment in the Trust may not be suitable for all investors. Investors should review this
Information Statement and CSLIP’s Investment Policy in order to determine whether such investment is a
suitable and eligible investment under for the relevant local government when considering your overall
investment objectives.
Past Performance No Guarantee of Future Results. Any financial and/or investment decision may incur
losses. Many factors affect performance including changes in market conditions and interest rates and in
response to other economic, political, or financial developments. Investment involves risk including the
possible loss of principal. No assurance can be given that the performance objectives of a given strategy
will be achieved. CSLIP anticipates that an “AAAm” rating by S&P Global Ratings will be obtained after
S&P evaluates a number of factors, including credit quality, market price exposure, and management.
Ratings are subject to change and do not remove market risk. CSLIP is not a bank.

FEES AND EXPENSES
CLSIP currently imposes the fees and expenses listed below, though such fees may be subject to change.
The fees are charged directly against investment earnings. Participants will not incur any direct fees. Fees
for the services of the Fund Administrator, Board Administrator and Investment Advisor are calculated as
a percentage of average daily net assets as follows: (1) $0-$1 billion: 0.1375%; (2) over $1 billion: 0.1275%.
These fees are accrued daily and payable monthly. An additional fee up to twelve and one quarter (12.25)
basis points is set aside to pay other operational expenses including, but not limited to, expenses of the
Board, insurance, legal, audit, rating, custody, and banking services.

In January, RTD implemented a simpler, more
equitable, and more affordable fare structure.
Customers now pay less for fares in all categories,
including eligible discounts.

On behalf of the agency, I truly appreciate the
opportunity to lead this team of dedicated individuals as
we strive to be the trusted leader in mobility, delivering
excellence and value to our customers and community.

In 2024, RTD celebrated many successes and first-time
accomplishments for the agency. While the list of
achievements is long, I would be remiss if I did not
specifically highlight a few that have made the lives of
RTD’s employees and customers better.

Financial
Analysis

Through the efforts of RTD’s Finance team, agency
executives, senior managers, and subject-matter experts,
these four initiatives are reflected throughout this budget
and interwoven into work plans across all departments
and divisions. By focusing on these important factors,
RTD will continue to make meaningful progress toward its
established success outcomes. RTD also continues to
adapt to the ever-evolving transit needs of customers and
communities throughout the service area.

I also extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the
many employees who directly contributed to the
preparation of RTD’s FY 2025 Budget. I specifically want
to acknowledge Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer;
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget; Heidi Wagner,
Senior Manager, Finance; the agency’s Budget Analysts;
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement
Officer, for compiling this document; and members of
RTD’s Leadership Team. And lastly, I would be remiss not
to thank the customers, communities, stakeholders, and
partners who engage with RTD.

Of course, none of these accomplishments—and many
more—would be possible without the efforts of the
agency’s steadfast and committed employees who work
tirelessly every day. I acknowledge and appreciate their
collaborative efforts, as well as the contributions of the
Board of Directors and the agency’s labor and contract
partners.

Executive
Summary

The Fiscal Year 2025 Budget represents the agency’s
financial plan for the forthcoming year. This budget aligns
with the agency’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, which
outlines an ongoing commitment to the Strategic Priorities
of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success. With this commitment
also comes a continued emphasis on the strategic
initiatives of Back to Basics, People Power, Welcoming
Transit Environment, and the newly introduced initiative
of Customer and Community Connections.

Between May and August, RTD completed the first
phase of its Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project.
The project reconstructed 30-year-old rail
infrastructure along the agency’s original light rail
alignment. Crews completed weeks ahead of schedule,
and subsequent phases of the project are slated for
2025.
• In September, RTD’s one-year Zero Fare for Youth
pilot program became permanent for customers 19
and under. The Colorado legislature appropriated
funding through December 2025 to support the zerofare youth program.
• Over the last year, RTD made significant progress on
its comprehensive Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan.
The plan is assessing the agency’s operations to
determine a path forward for lowering emissions. The
plan is on track to be completed by mid-December
2024.
•

Attachment: FY2025_Budget_2024-11-11_SMALL [Revision 1] (5023 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

Over the last year, the Regional Transportation District
has redoubled efforts to maintain its assets in a state of
good repair, enhanced employee recruitment and
retention initiatives, and made significant progress in
creating a welcoming transit environment.

RTD also made major progress on its Facilities and Fleet
Transition Plan (FFTP), which is a framework and
technical vision to guide the agency in its transition to
alternative fuels. This plan will be completed in midDecember 2024, and a final report and presentation will
be shared with the Board.

RTD also completed a Northwest Rail Peak Service
Feasibility Study. This months-long study updated
assumptions and costs regarding completion of the
unfinished FasTracks Northwest Rail corridor which would
provide rail service from downtown Denver through
Boulder to Longmont. The results of that study were
presented to the Board on September 18, 2024.

Financial
Analysis

P

In January 2024, RTD implemented Board-approved
recommendations resulting from an 18-month fare study
and equity analysis. This new fare structure simplified
and lowered fares while also addressing any equity
concerns. The changes followed a comprehensive
analysis, which included significant public outreach and
engagement efforts. The financial impacts of lowering
fares were relatively modest, and community acceptance
and feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.

RTD’s People Power initiative experienced improved
hiring and retention, particularly with frontline staff and
an expansion of the Transit Police division. Through June
2024, RTD’s active employee counts rose to 3,457 as
compared to 2,943 in June 2023, with increases primarily
in bus and rail operators. Historically, these job
categories have been chronically understaffed. The June
2024 vacancy rate for budgeted positions stood at 15%.
These staffing improvements have resulted from
expanded ongoing hiring and recruitment activities as
well as certain retention initiatives, including enhanced
training, onboarding, mentorship programs, and certain
total rewards improvements.

RTD continues to expand its Transit Police force in
support of the Welcoming Transit Environment initiative
while also implementing certain measures in support of
crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED).
Expansion of the Transit Police function has provided
additional security assurances to customers and
operators, and devoted certain resources towards
addressing societal issues such as homeless outreach
personnel. This initiative will continue and is being
coordinated with several local jurisdictions throughout
the Denver metro area.

Executive
Summary

During 2024, RTD has continued to implement its System
Optimization Plan (SOP), which is the agency’s branded
Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA). This
implementation follows the COVID-19 pandemic and a
renewed focus on the agency’s operations and
maintenance activities, after having previously completed
several multi-year FasTracks transit expansion projects.

RTD also implemented several improvements during
2024 related to its Back to Basics initiative, such as the
COA, improved financial planning activities, and a focus
on maintaining a state of good repair for the agency’s
$9.3 billion of assets. During 2024, RTD began a year’s
long infrastructure reconstruction and repair effort to
maintain several light rail elements that have now
reached 30 years of revenue service. These ongoing
efforts align with RTD’s Transit Asset Management (TAM)
Plan (see Appendix) with a focus on providing continual
transit services while maintaining taxpayer’s investments.

Attachment: FY2025_Budget_2024-11-11_SMALL [Revision 1] (5023 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

Fiscal year 2024 primarily focused the agency’s
expenditures on providing core business services to
customers while, at the same time, enacting certain
Strategic Plan Initiatives of People Power, Back to Basics,
and providing a Welcoming Transit Environment.

In addition, RTD continues to meet the Board-approved
fiscal policy requirements for maintenance of adequate
reserves and debt coverage ratios. The agency’s senior
bond credit ratings were also raised by S&P Global during
2024 to the highest rating of AAA. RTD continues to
cash-fund all purchases without the need to borrow
funding and continues to reduce its debt portfolio
exposure through refinancings and the efficient use of its
financial resources.

Executive
Summary

A Revenue Diversification Working Group was convened
in early 2024 that sought to reduce RTD’s financial
exposure and risk using concentrated revenue funding
sources. Board-approved recommendations from this
Working Group included enhancements to RTD’s
recommended 2025 Fiscal Policy.

Attachment: FY2025_Budget_2024-11-11_SMALL [Revision 1] (5023 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

Financially, RTD continues to perform well. In August,
the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) completed
a financial performance audit of RTD, which resulted in
the agency meeting all nine of the state’s financial health
measurements with no warning signs.

Light Rail Preventative Maintenance Work
In early June, RTD began implementing speed restrictions along isolated sections
of track until necessary preventative maintenance work is completed. Along the D,
E, H, and R lines, RTD’s Maintenance of Way (MOW) team has staged and
installed thousands of feet of new rail, welded rail joints, grinded surface defects,
and leveled track ballast. In 2024, RTD’s MOW team accomplished the largest
overnight rail installation in the agency’s history.

Enhanced Track Inspections
To ensure track infrastructure is maintained in a state of good repair, RTD
implemented an enhanced inspection process in May. The intent of the regularly
scheduled inspections is to proactively identify preventive maintenance needs,
avoid major infrastructure issues, and reduce the risk of hazards and system
failures. The thorough inspection process includes a visual, electrical, and
mechanical inspection of all components that affect safe and reliable operations,
as well as standards for implementing speed restrictions if deficiencies are noted.

Coping Panels Project
In August, RTD concluded its multi-year project to repair the caps of retaining
walls that run along I-25 between Denver and Lone Tree. All coping panels along
the Southeast Corridor, between I-25•Broadway Station and Lincoln Station, were
reinforced to provide additional strength and weather resistance. In 2024, RTD's
project contractor added extra work crews to expedite the repairs, resulting in its
completion approximately three weeks ahead of schedule.

RTD commenced a multi-phased, first-ever project in early June to reconstruct
light rail track in downtown Denver. The first phase of the full-depth
reconstruction project focused on five key intersections in Denver’s Downtown
Loop, which is part of the agency’s original light rail line that opened in 1994.
Phase one of the project was completed on August 29, 2024, approximately three
weeks ahead of schedule. Phases two through four of the approximately $152
million reconstruction project will resume in 2025.

Employee Recruitment and Retention
To more expediently fill open positions, RTD added a key recruitment positions in
both Bus Operations and Rail Operations. Additionally, the agency launched multifaceted paid marketing campaigns to generate interest and attract applicants. RTD
also hosted multiple career fairs for select high-need roles, such as bus operators.
These tactics have helped close the gap in open positions for departments and
enabled the agency more effectively deliver transit services in the community.

Service Changes Outreach and Feedback
Ahead of RTD’s September Service Changes, the agency overhauled its
communications and engagement approach and adopted a more robust outreach
strategy. The completely revised approach enhances communications to
customers and stakeholders, introduces new opportunities for in-person and
virtual feedback, leverages existing community events, directly connects with
customers at stops and stations, and explains the proposed changes in a more
straightforward manner.

Improved Asset Management
In June, teams involved in asset management began brainstorming best practices
aimed at improving the agency’s asset management program. An immediate need
to improve capital project prioritization was identified. Members of Finance and
Administration quickly developed a new scoring tool and process to prioritize the
many capital requests and ensure close alignment with RTD Strategic Priorities.
Developing and implementing this new tool allowed Finance to prioritize capital
requests for the 2025 budget cycle in a timely fashion.

Executive
Summary

Cyber Security Awareness
To reduce the likelihood of a costly mistake for the agency, RTD has spent much
of 2024 improving employee training on recognizing and flagging phishing
attempts. Improved training and enhanced detection and remediation tools has
helped RTD protect itself from the ever-increasing threat of cyber attacks that
could adversely impact daily operations.

opportunities for all employees. As part of the year-long calendar of events, RTD
celebrated all agency employees for Transit Employee Appreciation Day in March.
Additionally, RTD coordinated an agency-wide donation drive for National
Volunteer Month in April, and supported the Rail Rodeo, Snowplow Roadeo, and
Bus Roadeo. The 2024 Bus Roadeo was the largest competition in RTD’s history.

De-Escalation Training for Operators
The agency continued to improve its de-escalation training for operators by
incorporating RTD Transit Police input and participation. During the first quarter of
2024, operators received updated training that now includes presentations about
criminal liability, what constitutes criminal activity, and the importance of reporting
all crimes. RTD-PD also hosted several open houses for bus operators to obtain
information and best practices related to their safety directly.

RTD implemented many new tactics in 2024 designed to break down silos,
increase the flow of information, and ensure all employees are well informed. In
January, the agency implemented an all-digital version of Inside Connections, the
employee weekly newsletter. The interactive, virtual format has increased access
to real-time updates and garnered greater engagement. RTD also overhauled its
bi-monthly all-employee forums and weekly frontline staff bulletins.

Executive
Summary

Manager and Supervisor Training
In October 2023, RTD launched a comprehensive, six-part training for all
managers and supervisors. The in-person training seminars focused on enhancing
leadership skills, being an effective supervisor, instilling RTD’s values, and goal
setting, as well as other topics. The trainings went through June 2024 and will be
an ongoing part of RTD’s onboarding process for new managers and supervisors.

Elevator Pilot Program
In March, RTD launched its Customer Experience Elevator Pilot Program at three
light rail stations. Following a successful 90-day pilot, the program expanded to six
locations, with more in the works. The program entails elevator doors at stations
being reprogrammed to remain at rest in the open position to deter criminal or
unwanted activities inside the elevators. The initiative as part of the agency’s

Live Look-in on Buses and Trains
RTD completed a major technology project to enhance operator and customer
safety by installing live look-in equipment on all its bus fleet. The new system
enables RTD’s public safety dispatchers to both view and hear individuals,
situations, and events occurring on a vehicle in the moment. With the live look-in
system, RTD’s public safety dispatchers can use a secure, cellular network
connection to hear audio and view video in real time from the cameras on board
the vehicle. Currently, 20% of light rail vehicles have the live look-in capability.

New Fare Structure
For the first time ever, RTD lowered its fares for all services systemwide on Jan. 1.
The change resulted from a yearlong fare study and equity analysis aimed at
creating a fare structure that is more equitable, affordable and simple for
customers. As an example of the new lower fares, RTD’s monthly pass is now $88,
a discounted monthly pass is $27, and the LiVE program increased customer
discounts to 50%.

Police Department Growth
RTD-PD has continued momentum in building the agency’s police force. The
department aims to reduce criminal activity and improve the personal safety and
security of customers and employees on RTD property, stations, and vehicles.
Currently, 80 officers are in the department with another 10 candidates in police
academy training. RTD is actively shifting from contracted security personnel to
directly employing sworn officers. The addition of officers enables RTD-PD officers
to be a regular presence on buses and trains and at stops and stations.

Theft Report Cards
RTD Transit Police continues to issue Theft Report Cards at Park-N-Rides to make
customers aware of activities that make them targets for vehicle break-ins. If
police officers notice a vehicle with personal belongings in full view, they will
create a report card informing the owner of the unsafe practice. The report cards
make riders aware of unsafe practices while also suggesting ways to make their
vehicle less of a target in the future. Last year, RTD Transit Police issued more
than 5,300 report cards aimed at helping customers reduce their risk.

On May 5, RTD-PD began a 24/7 patrolling model to enhance the personal safety
and security of RTD’s frontline employees and customers. The overnight team
focuses on areas in need of greater safety efforts for bus and rail operators, such
as when employees begin their morning shifts at Denver Union Station. As the
police force continues to grow, the additional officers will help the department
proactively address other problems on bus and rail vehicles as well as situations at
stops and stations around the district.

Executive
Summary

Impact Team
The Impact Team Pilot Program commenced in May and included 45 employee
volunteer ambassadors. The focus of the program was to assist customers during
peak service times, planned and unplanned service disruptions, and large events
near RTD’s stops and stations. During the pilot program’s four-month period,
ambassadors completed sixty-one assignments, directly assisted more than 3,700
customers, and provided 232 hours of service.

Zero Fare to Vote
This year, RTD’s Board of Directors approved Zero Fare to Vote as an ongoing,
permanent fare change to encourage voter participation. Zero Fare to Vote will
occur every two years during the election cycle and removes a cost barrier for
people to travel on RTD services to cast their ballot. In 2024, with support from
the Colorado County Clerks Association, RTD services will be available at no cost
on National Vote Early Day and Election Day.

Zero Fare for Youth
RTD implemented Zero Fare for Youth as a permanent program in September,
allowing youth 19 and under to use all RTD services at no cost. The program
started as a one-year pilot program in 2023 to provide affordable, equitable, and
simple transit options for youth. RTD received positive feedback from many
schools about the program’s impact in reducing truancy, and it gained support
from school districts, youth organizations, and customers across the entire Denver

RTD is an active participant in a nationwide effort by the White House to increase
training and access to lifesaving opioid overdose reversal medications. The agency
was among the first five transit agencies to be called to participate. At RTD, opioid
overdose reversal medication is carried by all officers and contracted security

individuals experiencing an overdose. RTD continues to be a nationwide leader in
the initiative and has provided support to other transit agencies.

Executive
Summary

Unhoused Outreach Coordinators and Mental Health Clinicians
RTD currently has two mental health clinicians, and a homeless outreach
coordinator working on behalf of RTD across its service area. Given the success of
the program, the agency is now actively recruiting to add three additional mental
health clinicians and four unhoused outreach coordinators. As part of the program,
a Transit Police officer accompanies a mental health clinician to provide referrals
and resources, rather than make an arrest for what could be misinterpreted as
criminal behavior rather than understood as a mental health crisis.

Updated Safety and Mental Health Resources
RTD’s buses and trains received fully updated mental health and safety cards in
September. The cards provide a list of available resources, with English on one
side and Spanish on the other. The resource also features a QR code for
customers to access a mobile version of the card. The cards include phone
numbers to access support resources related to human trafficking, domestic
violence, and crisis intervention. The updated card is also carried by frontline staff
across the agency to provide to individuals in need.

Trip Planning Integration Pilot
RTD is undertaking a pilot project to integrate trip planning with its mobility
partners, including the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT)’s Bustang
services, Boulder BCycle, Lone Tree Link, and Lyft scooters. Through the Transit
app, customers can purchase fares and plan trips with end-to-end travel
connections via RTD and the mobility partners. RTD and its technology partner
Masabi received a METRO Magazine Innovative Solutions Award earlier this year
as a result of the pilot project. The pilot program is the first of its kind in the U.S.

Executive
Summary

National Roadway Safety Strategy (NRSS)
In April 2023, RTD pledged to support the NRSS goal of eliminating roadway
fatalities. At that time, the agency developed seven specific, internal goals aimed
at improving roadway safety. Focusing on the seven goals and related data has
helped RTD identify problem situations and address them in real time before a
bad outcome is realized. RTD’s efforts in this area have gained attention from the
U.S. Department of Transportation resulting in a request for RTD to present its
agency progress and methodology at a recent webinar in September 2024.

Customer-Facing Digital Signage Updates
In 2023, RTD began a customer amenities project to add approximately 130 large,
freestanding, walk-up screens at light rail and commuter rail stations. The digital
screens provide schedule information and promote the agency’s services, as well
as generate advertising revenue. Additional customer-facing digital signs are also
being installed at key bus stops, facilities, and transit centers across RTD’s service
area. RTD also launched an effort in 2024 to replace and install new variable

Reopening of the Downtown Boulder Station
In February, RTD reopened its Downtown Boulder Station following months of
remediation work to the facility. The interior of the station was initially closed in
2023 after methamphetamine residue was detected in the restrooms and found to
have entered the interior ductwork elsewhere in the station. As part of the work,
new sheet metal ductwork was installed with exterior insulation, allowing its
interior surface to be cleaned as needed. Ventilation within the restrooms was
improved, and a modest refresh of the station’s lobby was completed.

Executive
Summary

RTD-PD Cadet Program
RTD launched a new police cadet program for full-time college students in the
Denver metro area who are pursuing a criminal justice or related degree. Police
cadets will gain insight about the day-to-day work and obtain specialized training
for skills essential to pursuing a career in public safety. The program serves as a
resource to recruit potential RTD-PD officer candidates, and cadets can potentially
earn college credits.

Budget Summary: FY 2025

Materials and supplies increases are expected as RTD
adds revenue hours in alignment with its SOP. Repair
parts have experienced sharp increases in prices due to
the inflationary environment and are expected to
continue into 2025. RTD contracted in October 2024 to
lock in diesel fuel prices with an expected 400,000-gallon
locked price of $2.99/gallon. This prices will be carried
over into 2025, and a contracted price of $2.52/gallon for
and additional 6.75 million gallons necessary for FY 2025
usage.

Capital Expenditures

P

Capital expenditures for 2025 are largely driven by the
TAM Plan. Details of these budgeted capital expenditures
are provided herein and a schedule depicting and
describing the 2024 capital carryforward will also be
provided with the final recommended 2025 budget
appropriation.

The decrease in capital from 2024 is due mainly to the
2024 appropriation of capital for the multi-year light rail
reconstruction effort that was budgeted at $152 million in
2024, and unused appropriations will be carried forward
into 2025. This reconstruction effort will ensure RTD’s
light rail track and related infrastructure, that opened for
revenue service beginning in 1994, is maintained in a
state of good repair.

Benefit costs will increase along with new hires while, at
the same time, experiencing inflationary and claims
experience increases for certain health and welfare costs.
Certain health plans offered to employees will have
premium rate increases approaching 20%, for which RTD
will seek strategies to contain ongoing future large
increases. Retirement plans include a $15 million lump
sum contribution to the closed non-represented
employee pension plan, and a 9% of salaries contribution
to the non-represented employee defined contribution
plan. While CBA negotiations are ongoing, the FY 2025
budget contemplates a continuation of a 13% of wages
contribution to the closed represented employee pension
plan and a 9% contribution, with up to a 5% additional
matching contribution, to the represented employee
defined contribution plan currently budgeted.

Fiscal Year
2024

Sales and use tax revenue, which comprises more than
70% of RTD’s funding sources, is derived from the
September 2024 forecast provided by the University of
Colorado Leeds School of Business, and it anticipates
growth of 4.2%, after experiencing an estimated 1.0%
growth in 2024, as the economy is expected to stabilize
from prior high inflationary levels. These levels depressed
real incomes and spending. Grant revenue decreases
compared to 2024 are due to the one-time, pass-through
grant for the East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project
that was budgeted in 2024, however, RTD’s primary
source of ongoing grant revenue from Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) Section 5307 preventive
maintenance grants will continue to be a significant
source of funding in 2025. Overall, revenue is anticipated
to keep pace with increases in expenditures in 2025,
while also maintaining adequate reserves and supports
RTD’s Strategic Priority of Financial Success.

Salaries and wages will increase as RTD continues to
pursue its People Power Strategic Initiative to improve
hiring and retention, particularly for vacant frontline
positions, as well as the expansion of the Transit Police
division. Reduction of the 15% vacancy rate is expected
to occur while providing necessary resources to achieve
the System Optimization Plan (SOP). At the same time,
RTD is also providing support resources for frontline
positions. These increases will be partially offset by
expected reductions in voluntary overtime that has been
previously incurred to fill vacancies. Wage rate increases
have been included at a presumed inflationary rate,
however, Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)
negotiations with the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU)
Local 1001 are ongoing, and a final rate increase is yet to
be determined as part of that process.

Departments

The FY 2025 operating expense budget increases over

Operating Expenses

RTD’s 2025 operating revenue budget is expected to
decrease in the forthcoming year in comparison to the
one-time revenues budgeted in 2024. RTD conservatively
budgets for projected revenues in accordance with its
Fiscal Policy to only plan for revenue that is reasonably
certain to be collected. Fare revenue, grant revenue, and
other income are all based on projections from the
Board-approved 2025-2029 Five-Year Financial Forecast
(FYFF), utilizing modest assumptions in ridership growth,
actual grant apportionment information, and baseline
assumptions for other revenue, including advertising,
investment, and miscellaneous sources.

RTD will continue the multi-year light rail reconstruction
project in 2025. This ongoing project will maintain light
rail tracks in a state of good repair and aligns with the
Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan. Funding for this
multi-phased reconstruction project will be carried over
for the unused portion of the 2024 Budget appropriation
of $152 million. Staff will continue to evaluate these TAM
Plan funding needs as additional rail condition
assessment information is collected, particularly
regarding the agency’s embedded track. An increase to
the Capital Replacement Fund during 2025 will provide
additional funding for future TAM needs, thereby
negating the need for additional borrowing.

RTD will continue to participate in discussions regarding
coordination with Colorado’s Front Range Passenger Rail
(FRPR) initiatives. RTD has not budgeted any funds for
this effort in FY 2025, but the agency is committed to
considering the future needs of this endeavor.

Fiscal Year
2024

The System Optimization Plan (SOP) will continually be
evaluated according to RTD’s Comprehensive Operational
Analysis (COA) during 2025, and service plan
modifications will be implemented in accordance with this
process during the planned January, May and September
2025 service changes. RTD may make other service
changes during the year, with Board approval, if
necessary. Staff intends to increase revenue service
hours by approximately 102,000 in 2025 according to the
SOP. This effort will require the continued pursuit of
recruitment and retention of additional front-line staff as
well as some additional supporting staff. Additional
funding for support vehicle maintenance is also
contemplated while provisions have been made for the
expected continued high cost of parts inventory that has
resulted from unprecedented inflation. The 2025 Budget
includes funding for these efforts and supporting
departmental budgets have been developed in concert
with these planned SOP changes to provide adequate
support.

Completion of the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan
Study, which evaluates alternative low- and no-emission
fuel technologies, will continue to be evaluated with the
Board of Directors, and any recommended future
changes contemplated during FY 2025 for
implementation in future years. Funding for this plan was
appropriated in fiscal year 2024, but no additional
funding is contemplated in the 2025 budget at this time.

Executive
Summary

RTD will continue to pursue the Strategic Initiatives of
People Power, Back to Basics, and Welcoming Transit
Environment, with the introduction of Customer and
Community Connections, during fiscal year 2025. The
2021-2026 Strategic Plan allows for modifications, as
necessary, with Board approval. Work tactics surrounding
the four Strategic Initiatives may change during the year,
at the direction of the General Manager and CEO, to
ensure the agency is agile and able to address
environmental conditions and changing needs.

RTD forecasts its revenues conservatively to ensure that
only reasonably certain funding sources are
contemplated when developing expenditures and
considering fiscal constraints. This approach provides
improved budget certainty while also supporting fiscal
sustainability. RTD has evaluated the potential effects of
revenue growth limitations from the Taxpayer’s Bill of
Rights (TABOR) which becomes effective in 2025. TABOR
growth limitations could potentially affect up to 50% of
RTD’s revenues, but staff does not anticipate refunds to
taxpayers being required for 2025. The November 2024
general election includes a ballot initiative seeking voter
approval to continue RTD’s exemption from TABOR
revenue growth limits. Any necessary 2025 budget
amendments due to the results of this ballot initiative will
be addressed with the Board of Directors in 2025.

Fiscal Year
2024

The 2025 Budget includes an assumed 4.2% increase in
tax collections from 2024, as outlined in the 30-year tax
forecast provided by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business. Sales and use taxes will continue to
comprise approximately 75% of RTD’s revenue sources
in 2025. Operating and capital grants appear lower in the
2025 Budget compared to 2024 due to the one-time
inclusion of a pass-through grant of $150 million to the
City and County of Denver for the East Colfax Avenue
BRT Project, which is anticipated to open for revenue
service in 2027. This pass-through grant had no financial
impact to RTD.

The 2025 budgeted grant revenue is primarily comprised
of FTA Section 5307 grant annual apportionments for
preventive maintenance, as well as a $5 million state
grant for the Zero Fare for Youth program. Other
revenue comprises just 3% of total revenue and consists
of investment income, advertising, and other
miscellaneous revenue. It is expected to be relatively flat
when compared to 2024.

Executive
Summary

The revenue in FY 2025 is budgeted to decrease
compared to the 2024 Budget. The 2024 customer fares
were estimated with the implementation of RTD’s new
fare structure, which took place in January 2024.
However, actual results during 2024 have been lower
than anticipated. The 2025 fares contemplate the current
experience, including continuation of the Zero Fare for
Youth program and have been budgeted lower by $6.8
million. Fares continue to provide approximately 5% of
RTD’s revenues. Sales and use taxes have been flat
between 2023 and 2024.

Operating expenses will increase in FY 2025 compared to
the 2024 Budget, excluding the 2024 East Colfax BRT
grant of $150 million by $89.1 million.

Utilities, which are primarily comprised of energy costs

relatively flat in 2025 due to expected continued similar
volume usage and no significant rate increases assumed.

Purchased transportation will increase in accordance with
bus fixed route contractual increases and the
concessionaire agreement for commuter rail services.
Contractual increases account for inflation as well as
periodic maintenance costs. These periodic increases in
payments will continue from 2025-2027 before being
reduced and will be funded from the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA).

Insurance costs are relatively small in relation to overall
expenses but are expected increase in 2025 due to
claims experience and increasing premiums. RTD is selfinsured for general liability and worker’s compensation
claims. RTD has certain excess liability limits under the
Colorado Government Immunity Act for claims involving
personal injury and property damage.

Financial
Analysis

Materials and supplies increases are expected as RTD
adds revenue hours in alignment with its SOP.
Replacement parts have experienced sharp increases in
prices due to the inflationary environment, as well as
supply chain issues, and it is expected to continue into
2025. RTD contracted in October 2024 to lock in diesel
fuel prices, with an expected 400,000-gallon locked price
of $2.99/gallon to be carried over into 2025, and a
contracted price of $2.52/gallon for and additional 6.75
million gallons necessary for 2025.

transactions and adjustments.

Additional increases in benefit rates will also occur due to
the additional employees and adverse health claims
experience. Retirement plans include a $15 million lump
sum contribution to the closed non-represented
employee pension plan, and a 9% of salaries contribution
to the non-represented employee defined contribution
plan. While CBA negotiations are ongoing, the 2025
Budget contemplates a continuation of a contribution of
13% of wages to the closed represented employee
pension plan, and a 9% contribution with up to a 5%
additional matching contribution to the represented
employee defined contribution plan.

Leases and rentals comprise a small portion of RTD’s
expenses, and those costs will remain flat in 2025
compared to 2024. These costs are primarily related to
facility leases such as the Civic Center Building, and other
certain smaller agreements associated with
communication towers and storage facilities.

Executive
Summary

Salaries and benefits include a $52.5 million increase due
continuation of frontline position hiring in support of the
System Optimization Plan (SOP). This increase adds
102,000 revenue hours in 2025. Wage rate increases
have been included at a presumed inflationary rate,
however, Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)
negotiations with the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU)
Local 1001 are ongoing, and a final rate increase is yet to
be determined.

Outside services will decrease significantly in 2025 due to
the one-time nature of the East Colfax BRT pass-through
grant that was appropriated in 2024. It will be carried
forward in the 2025 budget, thereby not necessitating
additional appropriation.

Debt Service by Issuance Type

Executive
Summary

The following charts display RTD's debt service obligations. These obligations include revenue bonds, lease-purchase
agreements, also known as Certificates of Participation (COPs), and other multi-year obligations. Other obligations
include RTD’s public-private partnership (P3) concessionaire agreement, which financed the design and construction of
the EAGLE Project. These charts provide debt service information and show the different components by type of
obligation, fund (Base System versus FasTracks), and the interest and principal. All obligations have fixed interest rates
and terms and are not subject to acceleration.

More information about RTD’s TAM Plan is available in the Appendix.
Along with information about its support of the agency’s financial planning process,
a categorical projects list with locations and descriptions is also available.

Executive
Summary

RTD is continuing its efforts to improve and complete the TAM inventory of assets while also gathering Asset
Information Maturity (AIM) data to assist in evaluating the condition of assets to adequately plan for repairs and
replacements. Gathering this information is a multi-year effort and is contemplated in RTD’s internal initiative to
improve the financial planning process. That process was described in the July 2024 Board presentation of the 20252029 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF), and it is expected to reach a more mature level for use by 2027. The process
includes three generations of implementation with the initial steps implemented in 2024 and continuous improvement
achieved in the following years.

Attachment: FY2025_Budget_2024-11-11_SMALL [Revision 1] (5023 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

The Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan provides RTD with information to plan for the repair and replacement of
assets, with a specific focus on maintaining a state of good repair. RTD currently has over $9.3 billion in capital assets
that have been placed in service over long periods of time.

The 2025-2029 combined cash flow projections and fund balances are provided below:

Attachment: FY2025_Budget_2024-11-11_SMALL [Revision 1] (5023 : 2025 Proposed Budget)

The FYFF provides the basis for preparation of the annual budget and the 30-year forecast. For budgeting purposes,
the FYFF provides target funding constraints to ensure fiscal sustainability. Combined with RTD’s Fiscal Policy to
maintain certain reserve levels as well as the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, the FYFF ensures that budget appropriations
are aligned with expectations of Financial Success and maintenance of a healthy financial position.

Executive
Summary

The 2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF) was approved by the Board on September 24, 2024. The FYFF is
not an appropriation but a planning tool which is useful, from a financial perspective, to evaluate fiscal sustainability.
In addition to this five-year forecast, RTD also periodically prepares a 30-year long-range forecast in coordination with
the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and other local municipalities with the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) as a component of the metro area Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) which is required for
RTD to continue to receive federal grant funding.

Reconciling items reflect cash activity in capital projects, inventory, accounts receivable and prepaids, accruals and capitalized interest.

2

Reserves include funds that are legally restricted by bond covenants, other contracts, Board designation and policy guidelines.

3

Reserves are an appropriated reserve which is available to fund unforseen projects expenses (such as a contingency reserve).
Reserves respresent revenues that are designated to be spent in future years for the construction of the FasTracks capital program.

About
RTD

Introductory information about RTD’s TAM Plan is available on page 61.

Reporting by Asset Classification
RTD structures its asset reporting by asset class rather
than by individual department to align with best practices
established by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
and National Transit Database (NTD) requirements. This
approach ensures consistent reporting, facilitates
regulatory compliance, and improves overall
management. More information is available in the 2024
NTD Policy Manual.

The TAM Plan offers a structured management
framework for planning asset investments, providing
strategic guidance to the financial planning process.
While the FYFF and annual budget serve as the
mechanisms through which these asset strategies are
implemented, based on practical financial constraints.
This combined yet distinct relationship between the three
ensures that RTD balances long-term asset stewardship
with fiscal responsibility, ultimately supporting the
agency’s goal of making lives better thought connections.

Financial
Analysis

The TAM Plan influences the budget by identifying and
prioritizing capital investment needs for assets. This
ensures that the investments reflected in the annual
budget are aligned with asset management goals and
support the agency’s long-term mission of delivering
safe, reliable service. However, because the budget is a
dynamic document responding to real-time financial
conditions, it may not fully fund all TAM priorities each
year. As such, the unfunded needs identified in the TAM
Plan are retained for future consideration within the
evolving budget cycle.

This asset class-based method allows for more
transparent and uniform tracking and monitoring of
investment needs across the organization. Reporting by
asset class ensures comparability with other transit
agencies, meeting NTD standards, and enabling better
decision-making. By utilizing asset class reporting, RTD
avoids the complexity and redundancy of reconciling data
across multiple departments, ultimately improving
transparency, and operational efficiency.

While the TAM Plan outlines long-term asset needs,
including renewal and replacement schedules, the FYFF
aligns funding priorities with identified needs. The
financial forecast also considers external factors such as
economic conditions, sales tax projections, and
operational costs. Although both processes aim to inform
decision-making, the TAM Plan emphasizes asset lifecycle
management, whole-life cost analysis, and risk
management, whereas the budget focuses on near-term
resource allocation and fiscal accountability.

Fiscal Year

D
E

One key reason for using asset classes is the crossfunctional nature of many transit assets. For example,
support vehicles may be procured and maintained by the
Bus Operations team, but the support vehicles are used
by other departments. Similarly, the Rail Operations
group may manage day-to-day use of infrastructure,
while capital renewal projects are overseen by Capital
Programs. This makes department-level ownership
ambiguous, leading to reporting challenges if the focus
were departmental rather than on asset functionality.

Executive
Summary

TAM Plan and Financial Planning
RTD’s TAM Plan and financial framework, including the
Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF), work in tandem to
support sustainable transit operations. The two also
serve distinct purposes. The TAM Plan is a strategic
planning tool focused on managing and maintaining
RTD’s assets over time, in compliance to federal
requirements, particularly those under 49 CFR Part 625.
Its primary role is to ensure assets are maintained in a
state of good repair (SGR), providing safe, reliable
services to the community. The FYFF and budget, on the
other hand, translate these strategic priorities and other
non-asset related agency needs into actionable financial
commitments based on projected and available financial
resources.

On Friday, October 4, 2024, RTD produced a draft version of its proposed Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Book (Budget Book).
The draft book was included in the Board’s Finance and Planning Committee agenda packet and posted online at rtddenver.com/budget. During the Finance and Planning Committee meeting on Tuesday, October 8, Directors provided
feedback about the Budget Book and suggested revisions. Additionally, staff carefully combed through the Budget Book to
make grammatical corrections and minor financial adjustments. To ensure all edits and revisions are clearly noted, the table
below outlines all amendments made to the October 4th edition of RTD’s Budget Book.

Trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the Board of Directors
amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust (Trusts,
collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in Resolution No.
001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same Trustees on both trusts.

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
RTD provides a DB pension plan to non-represented (salaried) employees hired before January 1, 2008,
and a DC retirement plan to salaried employees hired thereafter. Each plan is overseen by a Board of
Trustees comprised of four RTD staff, two RTD Board members and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer
serving as a permanent Trustee. RTD staff Trustees are recommended to the RTD Board by the General
Manager and CEO for appointment, and the RTD Board Chair, with full RTD Board approval, appoints
two RTD Board members as Trustees.
Trustees serve staggered terms of two years.
This action item seeks Board seeks the following for approval:
• Extend through December 31, 2026, the term of current Trustee Jennie Waski, Senior Specialist,
Benefits, whose term expires on December 31, 2024
• Replace current Trustee William Weidenaar, Manager, Vehicle Engineering, whose term expires
December 31, 2024, with Anthony Sabia, Director, Total Rewards with a term expiring December
31, 2026
• Replace current Trustee Bob Broom, RTD Board Director, whose term expires December 31,
2024, with Vince Buzek, RTD Board Director, with a term expiring December 31, 2026
• Replace current Trustee Bobby Dishell, RTD Board Director, whose term expires December 31,
2024, with Troy Whitmore, RTD Board Director, with a term expiring December 31, 2026
The above actions will result in a body of seven Trustees with one active Trustee being a participant in
the closed DB pension plan.
The term extensions and appointment of these Trustees will focus Trust governance with employees
who participate in and represent staff colleagues participating in these retirement plans, have expertise
in the areas of human resources, health and wellness benefits and finance as well as maintain Board
participation in the salaried employee retirement Trusts in its capacity as a policy-making body.
Further, the Trust plan documents will continue to require Board approval for changes in plan design and
annual budget appropriation in addition to any material changes to the plans coming to the Board
through the Audit Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.
