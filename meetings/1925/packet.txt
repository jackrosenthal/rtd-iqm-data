BACKGROUND
The purpose of this memorandum is to request an amendment to the 2014 Adopted Budget. This
amendment will account for capital carryforward adjustments from 2013 to 2014. The amendment also
will detail other adjustments to the capital budget and adjustments to the operating and administrative
budget.

DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2014 Budget Amendment

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.1

The total proposed appropriation for the 2014 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2014
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2014 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $13.6 million from the 2014 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $9.8 million on the
Base System, $2.6 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, and $1.3 million in FasTracks Operations
(West Line, Denver Union Station, and Free MetroRide). Of the total increase, $1.0 million is attributed
to previously approved transfers. On the Base System, the true increase to operating expenses is less
than 1% net of previously approved transfers and one-time expenses.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, major changes are summarized below.
Base System
Bus Operations
 Net increase of $0.615 million for increases in repair parts, materials and supplies, tech services
contracts, addition of dispatcher positions, and previously approved transfers
Rail Operations

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.1

Safety, Security & Facilities-FasTracks Operations
 Net increase of $0.956 million for DUS operating costs allocated to FasTracks Operations
Debt Service
Interest expense is projected to remain stable on a combined basis with no change. Capitalized interest
as well is expected to show no change. COPs debt issued in 2014 for Base and FasTracks is projected
to begin amortizing in 2015. Principal payments on base system debt are projected to increase
minimally by $0.729 million due to updated debt amortization schedules.
2014 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget reflects a net increase of $3.8 million over the
2014 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the 2014
Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes consist of an increase in Base of $32.3 million. Additions to new capital funding
include $32.7 million for restoration of funding for the articulated and transit buses that were subject of
a budget transfer to advance fund the intercity buses for BRT originally scheduled for purchase in 2016.
Please see Attachment B for detail.
FasTracks
New capital changes to FasTracks consist of a decrease of $28.6 million. This results from updated
project schedules for the North Metro and I-225 projects that changed the projected expenditures in
2014, adjustments for grant funding, and changes in cost estimates. Additions to new capital funding
include $18.1 million for additional commuter rail vehicles for the Eagle project approved by the Board in
December 2013, $4.7 million for light rail vehicle storage tracks for I-225 approved by the Board in April
2014, and $1.0 million for Peoria Interface coordination approved by the Board as part of the Annual
Program Evaluation in May 2014. Please see Attachment B for detail.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2014 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/13 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget. For the 2014 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 12/31/13
were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account expenditures that were
made in the last quarter of 2013.
Previously approved capital carryforward is decreased by $136.9 million from the 2014 Adopted Budget
to reflect fourth quarter 2013 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain capital projects as
expense projects, previously approved transfers, completion of projects, and project scope changes.
The Base System portion is a decrease of $8.4 million and the FasTracks decrease is $128.6 million.
Please see Attachment C for detail.

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.1

Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to decrease $20.5 million on a combined basis from the
2014 Adopted Budget.






Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $0.360 million based on the CU-Leeds
School March forecast of 7.4% vs. 7.5% in the Adopted Budget.
Federal grant revenues, including operating grants, capital grants, capital maintenance, FASTER
grants, CMAQ grants, and other grants are projected to decrease $20.7 million over amounts
projected in the 2014 Adopted Budget. This reflects decreasing allocations on the Base System
in fixed guideway, CMAQ-STAMPS, FASTER grants and Bus Facilities funding from the 2014
Adopted Budget, offset by increases in FTA State of Good Repair funding. FasTracks allocated
grants are expected to remain stable.
Fare revenue is projected to remain flat in the Amended Budget over the Adopted Budget based
on current year actuals run rate.
Other income is projected to remain stable at $20.7 million.

Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to decrease $14.1 million from the Adopted Budget to
$9.4 million reflecting amended budget increases, year-end accruals and the net pension obligation.

FasTracks Contingency Reserve
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and is used to fund any
changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption of the annual
budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the
FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks
Future Construction Reserve. The Reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010 and remains at
that level in both this Amended Budget and the 2014 Adopted Budget.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues

Packet Pg. 10

1.B.1

divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.

Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2014 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2014 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Year-End Fund
balance in the District's working capital. The objective is for the total of these three funds to equal
approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for the Base System and two
months of same for FasTracks. The contributions to the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund on the Base System are reduced from $5.0 million to each fund to $3.0 million to
each fund in 2014.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of principal are treated
as expenditures, and (2) depreciation and gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are
excluded.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2014 Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the operating
budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2014 Budget and amend the budget with
revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2014 Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2014 Adopted Budget does
not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and material changes to
the operating and administrative budget.

Subject:

First Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the First Quarter of 2014. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District. Of the 23 performance measures tracked, RTD met 17 of the goals in
their entirety in the first quarter; however, improvement is occurring in certain categories. The
following is a discussion of the performance measures not met.
Goal 2.1 – Prompt Response to Facility Complaints
Average facility maintenance complaints per month exceeded the goal of 14. Lighting issues made
up the majority of complaints in the quarter and they have been addressed. Snow/ice complaints
also had an impact. We expect the complaints will begin to decline in Q2 and the trend should
continue downward through the remainder of the year.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q1, however, we are
experiencing improvement in some categories from 2013. In local on-time bus service, First
Transit-Longmont exceeded goal while RTD Local and Veolia showed improvement over last year.
First Transit-Commerce City was flat to last year and First Transit-Denver was slightly down.
Regional and Express Service bus on-time performance also improved over 2013. Staff continues
to study the worst performing routes and identify the resources needed to improve. The GM has
taken the action steps currently employed under review as well. As staff targeted efforts continue,
on-time performance is showing improvement.
Light rail on-time service was behind goal in Q1 due to a malfunction in the train APC system from
mid-November 2013 to mid-February 2014 caused by a Siemens door software upgrade for the
200-series vehicles. The drop in on-time performance is directly related to this APC malfunction
which resulted in a smaller than normal sample size before the problem was discovered and
rectified. This issue skewed the results with a lower number of samples than usual in Q1.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
We have seen customer complaints increase across the entire system over the past 2-3 years due
to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, the stroller policy, and heavy/longer
load times, and the level of complaints has been consistent. Staff continues to review CAD/AVL

Packet Pg. 47

1.C.2

playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address the
valid issues.
The level of complaints actually improved in Q1 compared to last year. For carriers RTD and First
Transit-Longmont, the goal was exceeded in the quarter. For First Transit-Commerce City and First
Transit-Denver, the goal was achieved. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part of the
Operations/Customer Services report.
Goal 5.1 – ADA On-Time Performance
The ADA on-time performance in Q1 was 94.6% vs. goal of 96%. Carriers are currently
experiencing a high rate of FMLA requests and are also finding it increasingly difficult to hire
qualified operators. Extra job fairs and advertisement efforts are in progress.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue, EcoPass Revenue, and Total Revenue
The District did not meet its goal for overall increase in fare revenue in Q1, largely due to the
timing of pass revenue recognition. We recognize pass revenue over the year based on accounting
rules which does not coincide with actual sales. As a result, Q1 fare revenue does not mirror the
ridership increase but the variability is expected to smooth out during the remainder of the year as
revenue recognition gains pace with sales.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
RTD exceeded its vacancies goal in bus mechanics. We are experiencing a high level of vacancies
in this category and recruitment is on-going. Vacancies are due to retirements, system growth,
and the strong local economic recovery.

Due to the CAD/AVL and APC systems, on-time performance data is being generated on-line and is more accurate. We continue
to focus on the worst performing bus routes and identify the resources needed to improve. The GM is reviewing the action steps
currently being taken and considering changes that may be necessary. RTD Local, Veolia, and First Transit-Longmont showed
improvement over last year. Regional & Express on-time service also improved over 2013.

Sales & Use Tax Compliance Review Program
Update

BACKGROUND
The initiative to perform sales and use tax compliance reviews is to provide contracted review
services to supplement the sales and use tax compliance reviews currently performed by the
Department of Revenue (DOR).
During 2013, RTD and the DOR completed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) to establish terms and
conditions for RTD to provide contracted tax compliance review services. In October 2013, RTD issued
an RFP seeking proposals to provide these services followed by the Board of Directors approving a two
year contract with an additional option year with Revenue Recovery Group (RRG) in December 2013.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of the supplemental tax compliance review services is to provide additional resources to the
DOR to ensure that RTD sales and use tax filings are complete, accurate and timely throughout the
District. The process by RTD and RRG to complete tax compliance reviews is as follows:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
6)
7)
8)
9)
10)

RRG researches vendors in the District for consideration for tax reviews
RRG presents the list of selected vendors to RTD for approval
RRG presents the list of selected vendors to DOR for approval
DOR documents and initializes GenTax recording
RRG notifies vendor and begins discovery process
RRG recommends continuation or cancellation of review to RTD based on discovery results
RRG completes fieldwork (RTD, state and local (if applicable))
RRG presents review findings to RTD and DOR
DOR approves work papers and findings
DOR issues assessment or refund to vendor

The length of each compliance review can vary depending on the size and complexity of each
engagement as well as the responsiveness of each vendor.
RRG currently has six full-time employees who have completed the required DOR fraud prevention
course, executed confidentiality agreement forms and certified receipt an understanding of codes of
conduct.
RRG utilizes many techniques in order to identify areas to focus compliance reviews such as:
 Verifying taxpayer licensing information
 Conducting research using various resources and data

Packet Pg. 59

1.C.3




Performing initial reviews of industry groups to validate whether there are industry-wide
common compliance issues
Actively working with RTD to identify their unique compliance issues and understanding
geographical boundaries and aspects of the local economy

In March, the first six tax compliance reviews by RRG began and are currently in process. In May, an
additional 14 vendors were notified of planned compliance reviews. RTD and RRG are currently seeking
approval from the DOR for additional vendor reviews. Completion of field work, summarization of
findings, review and processing of the first audits are expected to be completed in the beginning of July.
RTD will record any net increases in sales and use tax revenues from the compliance review program in
the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) and report the balance each month in the Monthly
Financial Status Report. Staff will provide regular periodic reports on the progress of this contract with
RRG to the Board of Directors.

(2) Variance is primarily due to the timing of Eagle project expenses
(3) Variance is due to the timing of invoice receipt for building maintenance and security services
(4) Variance due to timing of data processing services, software licensing and low value computer hardare purchases
(5) Variance occurs with initial posting of purchasing card expenses prior to coding to individual cost centers
(6) Variance is due to the lump sum union payment which will be included in the amended budget
