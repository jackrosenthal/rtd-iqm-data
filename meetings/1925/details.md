#### 1. Approval of 2014 Amended Budget

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2014 to amend and appropriate funds for the proposed 2014 Amended Budget, to increase the appropriation by $0.546 million to $1,726.998 million as detailed below in the overview of the 2014 Amended Budget, and to decrease the appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by $136.980 million to $926.185 million.

This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current budgeting in a timely manner.

The 2014 Amended Budget appropriation includes the amounts in the Amended Budget column below (in thousands), which is a summary of relevant data from Exhibit I.

1)      The 2014 Amended Budget also includes operating revenue and non-operating revenue which are estimated, not appropriated, below (in thousands), which is a summary of relevant data from Exhibit I.

Motion:               Director Lasater made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the June 24, 2014 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Terry Howerter, CFO, introduced Jannette Scarpino, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis.  She presented the Directors an overview of the 2014 Amended Budget starting on page 71 of the Operations & Customer Service/Finance Administration & Audit/Civil Rights Committee Meetings Packet for June 10, 2014.

She reminded the Directors that the 2014 Adopted Budget was approved in November, 2013.  She also mentioned that the presentations for the 2015 Adopted Budget will begin in August, 2014.

She summarized the key points of the amended budget as follows:

- Increase to the overall appropriation of $546,000

- Overall decrease to revenue of $20.5 million

- Overall increase to operating expenses of $13.6 million

- Continue to build the Board Appropriated and Capital Replacement Funds at $3 million each for a total of $6 million

- Unrestricted fund balance will decline compared to the adopted budget

- The amended budget is supportable in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

- Request adoption of the amended budget at the June 24, 2014 Board Meeting

Director Bagley thanked Jannette Scarpino for spending time with him explaining the details of the amended budget.  He encouraged the Directors to meet with her as she does a great job of explaining the details in a timely manner.

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 1. 2015 - 2020 Strategic Budget Plan Update

Jannette Scarpino presented the 2015-2020 SBP Update starting on page 106 of the Operations & Customer Service/Finance Administration & Audit/Civil Rights Committee Meetings Packet for June 10, 2014.  She handed out a copy of the SBP Summary Cash Flow-Base slide to the Directors.

The SBP includes only service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use tax, and FasTracks operations activity (West Line, Denver Union Station, Free MetroRide) allocated to FasTracks funded by 0.4%.  The FasTracks expense and projects (non-operational) are included separately in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE) financial plan.

She outlined the SBP opportunities as follows:

- Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations

- Board strategic goals and General Manager tactical plans

- Sales/use tax compliance reviews

For SBP challenges, she listed:

- Sales/use tax volatility

- Fuel price uncertainty

- State of Good Repair commitments and needs

- Project prioritization and project deferral

- Continued development of fund balances

- FasTracks in-service costs and cost allocation

The next steps for the SBP are:

- Board adoption of the 2014 Amended Budget on June 24th

- Presentation of final SBP to Finance Administration & Audit Committee for Board Adoption on July 8th

- Board adoption of the 2015-2020 SBP on July 15th

- 2015 Budget Study Session on August 26th

During the presentation, General Manager Phil Washington noted slide 6 of the presentation which addresses a 10% fare rate increase to be considered by the Board every 3 years per the Board Bylaws. He said that staff will recommend a change of language to read “fare rate analysis” instead of “10% fare rate increase”.  The change must be done by the Directors as it is Board’s Bylaws[[1]](#_ftn1).

Director Anderson asked how RTD’s retail marijuana tax revenue would be affected if the statewide marijuana tax revenue exceeds the estimated annual revenue and lawmakers take action under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR).  Terry Howerter answered that action should not affect RTD’s retail marijuana tax revenue.

Director Bagley noted the reference by Jannette Scarpino of the SBP opportunity related to Board strategic goals and General Manager tactical plans.  He reminded the Directors of an email he sent inviting them to the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee on June 24th at 3:00 p.m.  At this time the General Manager’s tactical Plan will be reviewed.  The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee will provide their recommendations on July 1, 2014 to be voted on by the Board on July 15th.

Chair Sisk asked Jannette Scarpino to send the Directors the listing of deferred projects in the SBP’s first draft.  His concern is the possible domino effect the deferred projects may have on other projects scheduled for 2015-2016.

[[1]](#_ftnref1) After further discovery it was determined that this fare analysis is not part of the Board Bylaws but is outlined in the 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement that was approved by the Board at the October 29, 2013 Board Meeting.

#### 2. First Quarter 2014 Performance Measures

Jannette Scarpino referred the Directors to the First Quarter 2014 Performance Measures report starting on page 115 of the Operations & Customer Service/Finance Administration & Audit/Civil Rights Committee Meetings Packet for June 10, 2014.

She noted the overall improvement in on-time performance and customer complaints.  She highlighted the results of goals 3.1 and 4.2.

Director Deadwyler said she would communicate her comments to staff offline.

#### 3. Sales & Use Tax Compliance Review Program Update

Terry Howerter introduced Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, who presented the Sales & Use Tax Compliance Review Program Update.

Doug MacLeod said the first compliance review started in March.  The first results will be available in July.  He noted the length of the process as it involves discovery, identification, permissions, and approvals from RTD and Colorado Department of Revenue for a compliance review.  He noted that future updates will include any revenue generated for the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).

#### 4. April 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod presented the April 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report starting on page 129 of the Operations & Customer Service/Finance Administration & Audit/Civil Rights Committee Meetings Packet for June 10, 2014.

He noted that there may be some changes in the May, 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report as the W Rail Line was first included in the May, 2013 report.

Doug MacLeod reminded the Board that under the Net Position section on page 133 there is now a line item for the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).  He informed the Board that going forward there will also be a report included on the FISA that outlines each item identified in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM).  He stated that the figure under each year represents the estimated amount RTD will collect for that RAM item.  He explained that those figures will change over time as staff receives new information or circumstances change.  Doug MacLeod noted that the last column shows what has actually been collected to-date.

Director Hoy asked staff how they will keep track of the Sales and Use Tax Exemption Parity (parity).  Doug MacLeod said it is included in the last line of the FISA Report found on page 138.  He noted that staff is working on strategies to keep track of those items.  Terry Howerter added that RTD is working with the State as the State tracks some of the parity but not at the level RTD needs.  Director Hoy encouraged staff to do their best in tracking the parity

Director Bagley noted that the ridership for the base system is flat.  The new ridership is attributed to the W Rail Line.

### D. Other Matters

Chair Sisk asked Terry Howerter for an update on his trip to New York for the Certificates of Participation (COPs).  Terry Howerter said that the COPs price was set on June 5, 2014.  The COPs will close on July 1st.  He noted that at first not all the COPs were signed up for.  JP Morgan, the underwriter, will take the remaining COPs on their book and issue them to interested parties as they become available.  This allowed for all the COPs to be issued and for the North Metro Rail Line to move forward.  Brendan Morgan, Investment Manager, will send a full report to the Directors.

### F. Adjourn

Chair Sisk adjourned to the Civil Rights Committee at 7:46 p.m.
