Themes from Public Feedback
and Discussion of Tradeoffs
Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

15
Packet Pg. 17

Affordability: Feedback
• Overwhelming feedback that a fare
increase would have a significant impact
on disabled and low-income individuals
– Organized input from the Mile High Connects
Affordable Fares Task Force with a request for
a 50% discount program for individuals who
are at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty
Level
– Concern about the Access-a-Ride fares
continuing to be double the regular cash fare
16
Packet Pg. 18

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Affordability: Current Thinking
• Working with the Affordable Fares Task Force
to identify possible funding sources and
determine the feasibility of implementing a
low income half fare discount program
– A universally available low income half fare would
result in an estimated $11-$12M of lost fare
revenue every year

• Continuing to evaluate opportunities to
improve the existing Non-Profit Agency
Reduced Fare Program
– Reviewing results of a survey of participating
agencies intended to assess impacts of the
proposed changes on the agencies and their
clients (140 agencies participated)
17
Packet Pg. 19

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Day Pass: Feedback
• General consensus that the day pass
priced at two boardings is a good
alternative for most passengers in order to
eliminate transfers
– Acknowledgement from almost all participants
including low income individuals that having
access to a full day of travel for the price of a
round trip is positive

• Heard a desire to purchase day passes in
advance similar to 10-Ride Ticket Books
18
Packet Pg. 20

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Day Pass: Current Thoughts
• Day pass priced at a
roundtrip will be included in
the final staff
recommendation
• Access to the day pass on
board the bus is a key
component
• Evaluating options for
selling day passes in
advance at sales outlets

TriMet recently added ticket printers on
their buses to sell 2-Hour tickets or day
passes
Source: TriMet (Portland)

Packet Pg. 21

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Transfers: Feedback
• Many individuals expressed concern about
the elimination of transfers
– Often times these individuals did not understand
the day pass recommendation being priced at a
round trip would mean they wouldn’t pay more for
their trip or need transfers

• Results of passenger survey suggest:
– Single one-way trips in a day are infrequent and
not a typical travel pattern
– 89% of passengers make two or more trips per
day
– 2% of passengers pay cash and make only a
single one-way trip with transfers in a day
20
Packet Pg. 22

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Transfers: Current Thoughts
• Allow transfers for
passengers using smart
cards
• Cash paying passengers
would not get transfers but
could still purchase a day
pass at the price of a
round trip
• Limiting transfers to cards
is becoming an industry
best practice
– Encourages passengers to
use smart cards
21
Packet Pg. 23

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Bus Fares: Feedback
• Concern about keeping Express and
Regional bus fares while recommending
one Local fare on Rail
– Confusion about the difference between
Express and Regional routes

• Support for simplification of fares on
Regional bus routes
– Support for reclassification of routes between
Longmont and Boulder to a Local fare

• Concern about US 36 BRT having multiple
fares levels
22
Packet Pg. 24

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Bus Fares: Current Thoughts
• Consolidate Express and Regional routes
into one “REX” category
– Set price between the current Express and
Regional route

• Fare based on route
– US 36 BRT all-stop routes set at Local fare
and the express trips set at the REX fare
– All BRT trips between downtown Denver and
US 36-Sheridan station would be a Local fare
23
Packet Pg. 25

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Rail Zones: Feedback
• Conflicting comments regarding the proposal to
eliminate rail zones
• Survey suggests that many passengers like the
flat rail proposal and a general acknowledgement
that it provides simplification
• Concerns that eliminating rail zones provides a
fare reduction for higher income rail riders while
increasing fares on low income bus and rail riders
– Unfair that short trips are the same price as longer
(up to 20 mile) trips from the end of the lines

• Concerns about maintaining Express and
Regional bus fares with a flat rail structure
• Substantial revenue loss of $6M from flat rail fares
24
Packet Pg. 26

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Rail Zones: Current Thoughts
• Evaluating options to simplify zone /
distance based structure
– Considering a two-tier rail structure
• Expand the Local fare distance to address many of
the concerns that originally led to the flat fare
proposal
• Consolidate Express and Regional zones

– Maintain higher fare for longer trips

• Achieve consistency with current bus
thinking
– Two fare categories priced at the same levels
for bus and rail
25
Packet Pg. 27

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Airport: Feedback
• Conflicting feedback on Airport fare
• Desire to have a higher fare for occasional
visitor and business travelers
• Concerns about Airport fares being too
expensive for airport employees even with
the ability to use Regional day or monthly
passes
– Many airport workers today are able to ride with
an Express pass from closer park-n-rides and the
increase to a Regional pass would be substantial

• Some feedback that the hard boundary at the
Airport was unfair and shorter trips from east
Denver or Aurora should be less expensive
26
Packet Pg. 28

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Airport: Current Thoughts
• Continue to have a higher fare for single
trips to or from the Airport that would likely
only be used by occasional travelers
• Consolidation to the two fare categories
instead of three categories would allow a
REX day or monthly pass to be used for
travel to the Airport
– REX fare may be lower than the current
Regional fare
27
Packet Pg. 29

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Monthly Pass Pricing:
Feedback and Current Thoughts
• Concerns about monthly pass prices increasing at
a higher percentage than the cash fare increase
• Two reasons for the original staff recommendation
to increase the monthly pass breakeven point from
36 to 40:
– Level the discount between cash and monthly pass
users; with the 40 boarding breakeven passengers
could get almost the same level of discount by
purchasing day passes
– Achieve revenue targets

• Evaluating revenue impacts associated with
reducing monthly pass breakeven to 38 boardings
28
Packet Pg. 30

Attachment: Fare Study -ppt-April 28_Study Session_Final (2341 : Fare Study Update)

2.1.a

Other: Feedback and Current
Thoughts
• $2.50 would be better than $2.60
– $2.60 forecast to generate an additional $2
million of fare revenue each year

• Questions regarding Eco and CollegePass
pricing and the 12% increase
– Increase of 12% is based on the general fare
increase factored by ridership per the 2009
Board EcoPass policy
– Staff plans to evaluate Eco and CollegePass
pricing as part of the next steps
