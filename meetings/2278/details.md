## II. Fare Task Force Update (Bruce Abel)

Chair Sisk thanked everyone for their attendance at this evening’s Study Session.  He recognized that the Board would not be taking questions from the audience; this is a chance for the Directors to become more informed on what staff is proposing as a result of the public input process throughout the Fare Study.  He said that the final proposal will come to the Operation and Customer Service Committee on May 19th and to the full Board on May 26th.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, noted that Interim General Manager Genova sends his apologies as he is unable to attend the meeting due to a family emergency.  He recognized Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, and Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, who would be presenting the updated Fare Study recommendations with him this evening.

Lacy Bell reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the April 28th, 2015 Study Session Agenda Packet.  She reminded the Board that the objective of the Fare Study was to simplify RTD’s fare policy in an equitable and cost-effective manner to better serve the needs of the District and customers moving forward while meeting the following goals:

- Simplicity (ease of use)

- Acceptability/Marketability (implementable)

- Affordability/Equity (cost of service and relationship between modes and services)

- Achieve RTD revenue goals to avoid service reductions ($131.3M in 2016)

- Integrate 2016 transit line openings

Lacy Bell pointed out that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) currently includes increases in fare revenue in 2016 and 2019, which would typically come from an increase in fare levels.  Bruce Abel explained that RTD’s costs escalate by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) every year.  The rationale is that rather than change the fare every year to account for CPI, it is better to program in an increase of around a quarter every few years.

Lacy Bell said that staff conducted an online survey asking riders if they would prefer a fare increase or service reduction.  She stated that overall 47% of respondents prefer a fare increase to a service reduction, 22% had no preference, and 30% preferred a service reduction to fare increase.  She noted that individuals in the lowest income categories had a higher preference for service reduction over a fare increase.  Bruce Abel said that a similar survey was conducted in 2011.  In that survey there was unanimity in terms of all income categories preferring a fare increase as opposed to a service reduction, which is a different from the 2015 survey.  Lacy Bell commented that this feedback also generally supports what staff has heard at the public hearings.

Bruce Abel thanked the Affordable Fares Task Force headed by Mile High Connects for all of their efforts in working with RTD to address fares for low income riders.  He said that often groups come to RTD with requests, expecting RTD to pay for everything; this has not been the case with the Affordable Fares Task Force.  They are really working collaboratively with us to come up with a long-term, financially viable solution.  He expects the very productive conversations to continue.

Lacy Bell shared that staff received a great deal of input during the public comment process.  She said that several main themes did surface during the process and staff has had much discussion of the tradeoffs necessary to address the feedback received.  The major themes along with their public feedback and staff’s current thoughts are:

- Affordability: Feedback

o        Overwhelming feedback that a fare increase would have a significant impact on disabled and low-income individuals

o        RTD has received organized input from the Mile High Connects Affordable Fares Task Force with a request for a 50% discount program for individuals who are at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Level

- Affordability: Current Thoughts

o        Working with the Affordable Fares Task Force to identify possible funding sources and determine the feasibility of implementing a low income half fare discount program

o        A universally available low income half fare would result in an estimated $11-$12M loss in fare revenue every year

o        Continuing to evaluate opportunities to improve the existing Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program

- Day Pass: Feedback

o        General consensus that the day pass priced at two boardings is a good alternative for most passengers in order to eliminate transfers

o        Heard a desire to purchase day passes in advance similar to 10-Ride Ticket Books

- Day Pass: Current Thoughts

o        Day pass priced at a roundtrip will be included in the final staff recommendation

o        Access to the day pass on board the bus is a key component

o        Evaluating options for selling day passes in advance at sales outlets

- Transfers: Feedback

o        Many individuals expressed concern about elimination of transfers but often did not understand how the Day Pass would work

o        Results of passenger survey suggest that 2% of passengers pay cash and make only a single one-way trip with transfers in a day

- Transfers: Current Thoughts

o        Allow transfers for passengers using smart cards

o        Cashing paying passengers would not get transfers but could still purchase a day pass at the price of a round trip

- Bus Fares: Feedback

o        Concern about keeping Express and Regional bus fares while recommending one Local fare on Rail

o        Support for simplification of fares on Regional bus routes

o        Concern about US 36 BRT having multiple fare levels

- Bus Fares: Current Thoughts

o        Consolidate Express and Regional routes into one “REX” category

o        Simplify the US 36 BRT fares with Local fare for all-stop routes and trips between downtown Denver and the US 36-Sheridan Station and REX fares for all express trips

- Rail Zones: Feedback

o        Conflicting comments regarding the proposal to eliminate rail zones

o        Survey suggests that many passengers like the flat rail proposal and a general acknowledgement that is provides simplification

o        Concerns that eliminating rail zones provides a fare reduction for higher income rail riders while increasing fares on low income bus and rail riders

o        Concerns about maintaining Express and Regional bus fares with a flat rail structure

o        Substantial revenue loss of $6M from flat rail fares

- Rail Zones: Current Thoughts

o        Evaluating options to simplify zone/distanced based structure to a two-tier rail structure

o        Achieves consistency with current bus thinking

- Airport: Feedback

o        Conflicting feedback on Airport fare

o        Desire to have a higher fare for occasional visitor and business travelers

o        Concerns about Airport fares being too expensive for airport employees even with the ability to use Regional day or monthly passes

o        Some feedback that the hard boundary at the Airport was unfair and shorter trips from east Denver or Aurora should be less expensive

- Airport: Current Thoughts

o        Continue to have a higher fare for single trips to or from the Airport that would likely only be used by occasional travelers

o        Consolidation to the two fare categories instead of three categories would allow a REX day or monthly pass to be used for travel to the Airport

- Monthly Pass Pricing: Feedback and Current Thoughts

o        Concerns about monthly pass prices increasing at a higher percentage than the cash fare increase

o        Two reasons for the original staff recommendation to increase the monthly pass breakeven point from 36 to 40: (1) level the discount between cash and monthly pass users and (2) achieve revenue targets

o        Evaluating revenue impacts associated with reducing monthly pass breakeven to 38 boardings

Lacy Bell summarized that based on all of the public feedback staff is now proposing a Local Bus/Rail fare at $2.60, a local REX Bus/Rail fare at $4.50 and an Airport Bus/Rail fare at $9.00 per single boarding paying with cash.  The discount fares for seniors 65+, individuals with disabilities, Medicare recipients and students ages 6-19 would continue to be a half price fare.  She said single boardings paying with a Smart Card would receive a .25 cent discount and Day Passes would be 2x the comparable fare.  Lacy Bell stated that a Local Bus/Rail Monthly Pass would cost $99 and a REX Bus/Rail Monthly Pass would cost$171 which could be used for travel to the Airport.

Lacy Bell noted that these fare levels achieve the SBP target of $131.3M revenue for 2016.  She mentioned that there were also many comments about $2.50 being better than $2.60 for a local fare; however, the models are forecasting an additional $2 million in fare revenue each year so staff is continuing to recommend $2.60 for a Local fare.

Bruce Abel pointed out that there have been many questions regarding the Eco and CollegePass pricing increasing by 12%.  He explained that per the Board policy from 2009, until data from the Smart Cards is used to determine new Eco and CollegePass pricing, the pricing will escalate at a rate similar to the other fare increases.  He stressed that part of the next steps is to evaluate all RTD’s pass programs, including the Eco and College Pass.

Lacy Bell outlined the next steps as follows:

- May 19th Operations Committee

o        Present revised staff recommendation incorporating current thoughts and Board Feedback

- Board adoption May 26th

- Implementation early 2016

- Continued effort on pass programs especially regarding feasibility and timeframe for a low income discount program

o        Updates and recommendations expected by late summer

Chair Sisk recognized that there has been an extraordinary amount of work put into this study.  He appreciates staff being willing to step forward and listen with an open mind and then translate what they heard into refinements of their recommendation.  He believes this has been a very positive process.  Chair Sisk requested that each Director confine themselves to two questions initially and he will open it back up after everyone has had a chance to ask their questions.

Director Bagley pointed out that while the presentation discusses an $11-$12M shortfall in revenue if RTD offered the low income half fare, that is only until fare goes up again.  He stressed that any financial solution that is created with Mile High Connects needs to recognize that this is not a stable number and it will increase.  Bruce Abel stated that one of the main discussion points with the Affordable Fares Task Force is how a sustainable revenue stream can be established to move forward with a low income fare.  He said that sustainability is very much part of those conversations.

Director Bagley inquired how much it would cost to take the C Line from Littleton to Denver Union Station and then travel either to the Airport or Jeffco Government Center.  Bruce Abel stated that a day pass would always be the best option when a rider had a multiple leg trip.  He noted that people will need to consider what will best serve them before beginning their trip.

Director Walker wonders what staff plans to classify the trip from Nine Mile Station to University Station within the proposed two fare zones.  He noted that currently this is considered a Local fare despite being a very long trip.  Bruce Abel said that staff is currently working to establish the fare zones so it is difficult to say at this time.

Director Folska said she wanted to applaud staff for their efforts.  She believes they have really been doing a full court press in reaching out to the public.  She said that there are people that had the perception that RTD was wasting people’s time by having them provide feedback but not doing anything with it; however, this demonstrates that has really been responsive to the feedback we are receiving.  Director Folska really appreciates that.

Director Folska expressed that she is thrilled to see staff communicating in a collaborative way with Mile High Connects.  She shared that recently a city councilman asked why RTD does not provide public transportation free for everyone.  Director Folska stated that it is important for everyone to understand that we are doing what State Legislature mandates in having a certain percentage of our revenue come from fare boxes.  She noted that when RTD opens 5 new lines in 2016 that will represent a $5 billion capital improvement to our transportation system.  Director Folska called on our partners, like Mile High Connects, to apply for grants that can help RTD fill the gap to offer a low income discounted fare.  Bruce Abel shared that many of the conversations with the Affordable Fare Task Force have focused on ways that the non-profit community can help RTD with our revenue stream; everyone involved is concerned about not just getting a grant that lasts one year but coming up with a long term solution.

Director Lubow thanked staff for the incredible work they have done during the fare study.  She appreciates the movement staff has made in trying to address the public concerns.  She stressed how much RTD has heard from the local community about their economic crunch and how raising fares will really hurt our transit dependent riders.  Director Lubow wants staff to be aware that there is a lot of support from the Board to help low income people access RTD in the future.  Director Lubow expressed concern that customers would need to have a credit card in order to get a Smart Card.  She noted that many low income individuals do not have credit cards.  Bruce Abel stated that customers did not need a credit card to get a Smart Card.  Lacy Bell explained that even if a customer loaded only $3 onto a Smart Card they would still benefit from the discounted fare.

Director Lasater commended staff for starting with a 5000 piece puzzle that was missing about 2000 pieces and finding about 1500; it sounds like staff has not found all the answers quite yet but it was a huge undertaking to listen to the public and try to incorporate their feedback into the fare structure.  He thinks his constituents will be happier with staff’s updated proposal.  He appreciates that staff has made bus and light rail fares consistent.  Director Lasater inquired how a passenger can prove that they meet the age requirements for a discounted senior fare.  Bruce Abel said that the preferred method is for a rider to get a Special Discount Card but that does require the rider to come to the RTD Administrative Office.  He stated that there are other ways like showing your Driver’s license or Medicare card.

Director Francone echoed the other Directors’ sentiments that the Fare Study Task Force has done an incredible, and probably thankless, job. She marvels at the team’s ability to take the comments and weave them into the fare study and the presentation.  She thanked staff for their hard work.  Director Francone asked if it was correct that 2% of RTD’s total ridership used transfers.  Lacy Bell explained that 2% of RTD riders take a one way trip that requires a transfer.

Director Francone said that she really likes the Day Pass but asked for clarification between the Day Pass and Airport fare.  Lacy Bell said that essentially a rider that did not have a monthly REX pass would need to purchase a REX Day Pass to get to the airport.  Bruce Abel noted that having the Airport fare be equal to a REX Day Pass would also benefit employees as they could use it to get to and from the airport for work.

Director Hoy stated that he likes the Airport fare and REX Day Pass.  He said he appreciates staff restructuring the fare from DUS to US 36 and Sheridan.  Director Hoy asked why students at colleges that do not participate in CollegePasses do not qualify for our discounted fare for students; currently this fare is only extended to students through high school.  He wonders if this is something that has been considered.  Bruce Abel noted that throughout his tenure at RTD people have made requests that college students be able to qualify for the discounted student fare; however, when staff has evaluated the revenue impacts of extending this discount to adults who are not at a school that participates in the CollegePass, they have not seen a way to move in that direction.

Director Hoy wanted to confirm that RTD will not continue to give out a piece of paper for transfers.  He said he was very surprised when he saw transfers being proposed in the presentation.  He also asked for clarification on the single fare discount when paying.  Bruce Abel stated that transfers would only be done electronically.  When someone taps their SmartCard they can board another RTD vehicle for the next 2 hours and 59 minutes without having to pay.  Bruce Abel explained that customers paying for a single trip fare would receive a $0.25 discount.  Director Hoy noted that for those concerned about the fare increase it is certainly smaller for those using SmartCards.  Lacy Bell stated that it would only be a $0.10 increase for Local fares.

Director Tobiassen thanked staff for their hard work on this project.  He believes they have put a lot of thought and energy into it.  He agrees that the outreach and collection of data has been very thorough.  Director Tobiassen recognized that during his time on the RTD Board there have been several hot button issues he has heard about, one of which being transfers.  He said that he is glad to see the paper transfers go away and believes most of the drivers will too.  He has heard that transfers create conflict and are widely abused; implementing transfers through SmartCards will eliminate many of the issues drivers have to deal with.

Director Tobiassen shared that he is very sympathetic to low income wage earners.  He is happy to see there is progress in our conversations with Mile High Connects to come up with a program to address their concerns.  Director Tobiassen pointed out that one area that was not discussed was the Access-a-Ride fares and how in his opinion that will impact the poorest of the poor.  With Access-a-Ride fare being double the comparable single boarding fare, an Access-a-Ride customer could go from spending $9 per day to $10 per day.  He said that when your income is only $728 per month that is a significant increase.  Director Tobiassen hopes the Affordable Fare Task Force will take Access-a-Ride into consideration when developing a low income fare program.

Director Deadwyler added her heartfelt thanks to all the work that staff has done.  She recognizes that it was hard but the community can now say that we really heard them.  Director Deadwyler inquired if a Day Pass could be purchased for use on Access-a-Ride.  Under the proposed fare structure a local round trip would be going from $9.00 to $10.40; Access-a-Ride users would appreciate being able to take multiple trips in a day for the cost of one round trip.  She stated that for those that do not have very much money that is a large increase.  She also asked if Access-a-Ride users had to pay an extra fee to travel to the airport.  She recently heard that the cost to go to the airport could be $20 to $25 and expressed concern that the fare would only increase.  Bruce Abel said that there had been no conversation regarding the implementation of a day pass on Access-a-Ride.  Bruce Abel explained that the Access-a-Ride fare structure is 2x the comparable fixed route fare, so under the proposed fare structure, an Access-a-Ride trip would cost $5.20 if it was considered a local trip, $9.00 if it was considered a REX trip or $18.00 if it was considered an Airport trip.  Bruce Abel said that the current Access-a-Ride Airport fare is $24.00 so it would actually cost less under the proposed fare structure.

Director Anderson said that she was quite proud of the work staff had done in taking that much public input and incorporating it into a plan.  She believes that RTD has a staff that has risen to the challenge.  Director Anderson acknowledged that she was not very happy to see the transfers come back but believes staff has addressed this is a way she can live with.  She pointed out that Access-a-Ride is a hugely subsidized service.  She feels that it is time for organizations in the community to step up and help RTD better serve our low income riders.  Director Anderson stated that RTD cannot help them alone.  She believes that RTD and the community should engage our State Legislators to help us address those in our society that are hurting the most.

Chair Sisk said that he is seeing a real evolution in the way in which staff has taken the feedback from the community.  He feels this has been such a positive process.  Chair Sisk read a letter from the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition expressing their support of the modified proposal.  They appreciate that RTD staff was willing to consider fare scenarios outside of those initially brought forward for public comment and support the concept of fare equity among FasTracks corridors with having the same Local and REX fares for bus and light rail.  Chair Sisk believes this letter is so significant as this is not where we were two months ago.  He thanked staff for not only being there, but listening.  He thinks we still have some work to do but believes that staff is moving forward in a very positive way.

Director Archuleta asked how long the Day Pass was valid.  Bruce Abel explained that RTD’s service day ends at 2:59 a.m. so it would be valid from the time of issuance through 2:59 a.m. the next morning.

Director Walker recognized that it is difficult to put a hard and fast line in place for fare zones on the Light Rail.  He stated that he is in support of eliminating rail zones altogether because it is difficult to define and for riders to understand.  Director Walker shared that a recent report from the Brookings Institute showed that there has been a 98% increase in persons living in poverty since 2000 with much of the increase occurring in the suburbs.  He said that is another reason he supports eliminating fare zones for rail; this gives access to a reliable form of transportation from the suburbs to employment centers.  Director Walker emphasized Director Bagley’s point that today a low income discount fare of 50% is relatively small but in 5 to 10 years that could really add up.

Director Solano shared his concern that many impoverished people are being pushed out of the city and into the suburbs through gentrification.  He is worried about the fares from his area to Downtown being too expensive due to its large size.

Director Folska reiterated the idea that we need to be looking after the people in our community who are the most vulnerable physically and financially.  She said that people who use Access-a-Ride do not love having to use that service.  She believes most people prefer to ride on a fixed route within their community.  Director Folska stated that is it not mandatory for RTD to increase to cost of Access-a-Ride just because the cost of a fixed route ride increases.  She thinks it seems unreasonable to consider raising rates on Access-a-Ride at all.

Director Lubow supports Director Folska’s statement.  She hopes that when staff works with the Affordable Fare Task Force that Access-a-Ride fares can be addressed as well as those riders are typically very low income.  Director Lubow feels that not having the passes addressed is a whole in the fare structure that the Board is being asked to approve.  She requested that staff have an update on the pass programs prior to the Board voting on the new fare structure.  Bruce Abel said that staff will have an update.
