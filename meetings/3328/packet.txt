BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Account-based Ticketing (ABT) Discussion

Committee Meeting Date:
May 10, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Tonya Anderson, Senior Product Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD is transitioning from its current, obsolete MyRide stored-value card system to an account-based fare
collection system (ABT system) that will be compatible with a new generation of MyRide cards as well
as EcoPass and College Pass cards. In April 2021, the Board of Directors approved a contract with
Masabi to provide bus and rail platform fare validators for the ABT system.
DISCUSSION
As the ABT system is nearing implementation phase, staff will discuss system transition plans, a
communication strategy, and next steps, including the elimination of the previous generation of MyRide
stored-value card technology.
The agency’s implementation of the ABT system aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact at this time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022 Board Travel Expense Reinstatement

Committee Meeting Date:
May 10, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
May 24, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt Resolution No. _____, Series of 2022, concerning the reinstatement
in FY2022 of funding to be used for reimbursement for out-of-District travel-related expenses in the
amount of $3,000 for each Director other than the Board Chair and $3,750 for the Board Chair.
REPRESENTATIVE
Vince Buzek, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the agency for reasonable local and travel expenses
incurred that are necessary for the transaction of official RTD business. Historically, except as described
herein, each Director other than the Board Chair has been allocated $4,000 for local expenses and
$6,000 for travel, and the Board Chair has been allocated $4,500 for local expenses and $7,500 for
travel.
In 2009, 2011, 2020, and 2021, the Board adopted resolutions reducing the Directors’ reimbursement
limits for local and travel expenses as economic conditions required reductions in overall agency
spending.
As economic recovery from COVID-19 impacts continues, public health-related restrictions such as mask
mandates continue to be eased, and in-person transit-related conferences are once again scheduled,
reinstating reimbursement for travel-related expenses would allow Directors to resume travel outside of
the District in the exercise of their duties.
In adopting this recommended action and the associated resolution, the Board seeks to meet the
Strategic Plan priority goal of Community Value.
DISCUSSION
For FY2022 only, in light of ongoing economic recovery and improving public health indicators, the
Board will reinstate partial-year funding for out-of-District travel expense reimbursement in the amount of
$3,000 for each Director other than the Board Chair, and $3,750 for the Board Chair.

Packet Pg. 14

1.E.1

The amount traditionally allocated by the Board Office to defray the cost of registration fees incurred in
relation to Directors’ attendance of out-of-District transit-related conferences remains eliminated in
FY2022.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of the recommended action and associated resolution would result in a transfer of $45,750
from the General Fund to the Directors’ Travel Expense accounts. This amount represents a 100.55%
increase in the budget allocation for the Board’s overall FY2022 local and travel-related expenses.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

2022 Board Travel Expense Reinstatement

WHEREAS, The Board of Directors consists of 15 elected members who serve their
constituents on a daily basis throughout the community, at committee meetings, study
sessions, Board meetings, at the legislature, and at transit-related conferences and events;
and
WHEREAS, Each fiscal year funds are allocated to Directors’ expense budgets to allow for
reimbursement of their individual local and travel expenses; and
WHEREAS, The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on both farebox revenues and
sales and use tax revenues, resulting in the Board’s decision to suspend travel to, and
reimbursement for expenses pertaining to, out-of-District transit-related conferences and
similar events in calendar years 2020, 2021, and 2022; and
WHEREAS, As of April 2022, following the easing of social distancing requirements and
broad travel restrictions and the resumption of in-person events and conferences both locally
and nationwide, Directors once again have opportunities to travel within their districts to
conduct business and meet with constituents, and to travel outside of the state in the
exercise of their duties.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that, for FY2022 only, in light of ongoing economic
recovery and improving public health indicators, the Board hereby reinstates partial-year
funding for out-of-District travel expense reimbursement in the amount of $3,000 for each
Director other than the Chair of the Board and $3,750 for the Chair of the Board.
The amount traditionally allocated by the Board Office to defray the cost of registration fees
incurred in relation to Directors’ attendance of out-of-District transit-related conferences
remains eliminated in FY2022.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
MyRide Stored Value Discount Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

Committee Meeting Date:
May 10, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
May 24, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the MyRide Smart Card
Stored Value Discount elimination. This ensures compliance with federal laws, regulations and guidelines
related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Transit Equity Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD conducts an
equity analysis any time fare changes are proposed to ensure that changes do not unfairly impact people
of color and low-income populations.
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by
minority persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall
not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is
defined as all persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, nonHispanic.
Disproportionate Burden Analysis
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse
effects absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of
multiple fare changes shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall
ridership. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of
the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential adverse effects. The agency will then
analyze the modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate
burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial
legitimate justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the
proposed change.

Packet Pg. 17

1.E.2

Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD must analyze any available information generated
from customer surveys. Customer survey analysis indicates whether minority and/or low-income
customers are disproportionately more likely to use the mode of service, payment type, or payment
media subject to the fare change.
A fare equity analysis compares the existing fare to proposed changes and calculates the absolute
change as well as the percent change. Using the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Threshold, a determination will be made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that
are disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are
also used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit non-minority or non-lowincome populations.
An average fare analysis is undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed fare changes on the
average fare paid per boarding. The average fare analysis determines whether the changes
disproportionately adversely impact minority or low-income customers or whether non-minority or nonlow-income customers disproportionately benefit from the changes.
MyRide Stored Value Card System
RTD introduced its current MyRide stored-value smart card system (SV system) in 2013. Customers
using a MyRide card receive a $0.20 discount when purchasing a full-fare three-hour pass. Customers
using a Discount MyRide card issued to seniors, individuals with disabilities, and Medicare card holders
receive a $0.10 discount when purchasing fare for a half-fare three-hour pass.
At this time, the SV system is nearing the end of its serviceable life, and the agency will replace it with
account-based ticketing (ABT) system while retaining customers’ option to use newly issued smart cards
compatible with the existing smartphone app.
Existing MyRide cards and current MyRide stored value are not compatible with the new ABT system.
Due to this system incompatibility, customers will be required to take action to transfer any stored value
currently held via MyRide cards either:
•
•

To an ABT system account accessible via smartphone app or
To an ABT-compatible smart card if they do not intend to use a smartphone app to show proof of
valid fare

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the Strategic Plan priority of Customer
Excellence in establishing a streamlined process for the new ABT system with a central focus on the
customer experience.
As a result of the implementation of the ABT system along with the practice of fare capping, the
discontinuation of the SV system, and the need for customers to take action to move from the older
generation system to the newer one, staff recommends the elimination of the existing MyRide SV
discounts of $0.20 and $0.10 given to customers purchasing full-fare and discounted three-hour passes,
respectively.

Packet Pg. 18

1.E.2

To make this process as smooth and timely as possible for customers, RTD is proposing to discontinue
the sale and reload of MyRide cards and MyRide stored value in June 2022, ahead of the installation of
the new validators that starts at the end of July 2022, which will render the current MyRide cards
incompatible.
Summary of Findings:
• Disparate Impact Analysis – the analysis found that minority customers are expected to
experience a slightly smaller average fare increase than non-minority customers and an even
smaller increase compared to all customers. This suggests the potential impacts of the fare
change are more likely to be borne by non-minority and all customers as a whole. Therefore, the
proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount does not present a Disparate
Impact.
•

Disproportionate Burden Analysis – the analysis found that low-income customers are expected
to experience a slightly smaller average fare increase than higher income customers and even a
smaller increase compared to all customers. This suggests the potential impacts of the fare
change are more likely to be borne by higher income and all customers as whole. Therefore, the
proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount does not present a
Disproportionate Burden.

Conclusions:
All MyRide full-fare and discount customer populations are expected to see an increase in the average
fare. However, the proposed fare changes are expected to have a lesser impact on minority and lowincome customers, and a greater impact on non-minority and higher income customers. In no cases do
the changes in average fare reach or exceed RTD’s Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden
thresholds.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the MyRide Stored Value Discount Title VI Fare Equity Analysis will not result in any
direct or foreseeable agency financial impacts.

1.E.2.a

Executive Summary: MyRide Stored Value Discount Changes
In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD conducts an equity
analysis any time fare changes are proposed to ensure that changes do not unfairly impact people of color
and low-income populations. The proposal to eliminate the discounts on MyRide Smart Card Stored Value
(Full-fare and Discount MyRide card) calls for such an analysis prior to the board taking action.

Methodology
RTD’s Title VI Program outlines the agency’s Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies, as
well as the way in which RTD conducts fare equity analyses. In the case of the proposed fare product
discount elimination, the analysis aimed to answer one main question: does eliminating the MyRide
Stored Value (SV) $0.20/$0.10 discount disproportionately impact minority and low-income customers?
To answer this question, staff utilized data from the 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey to identify
any potential disparities in the proposed fare change.

Findings – 2019 Survey Data
All MyRide full-fare and discount customer populations are expected to see an increase in the average
fare. However, the proposed fare changes are expected to have a lesser impact on minority and lowincome customers, and a greater impact on non-minority and higher income customers. In no cases do
the changes in average fare reach or exceed RTD’s Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden
thresholds.
Disparate Impact Analysis (Minority Customers)
The analysis found that minority customers are expected to experience a slightly smaller average fare
increase than non-minority customers and an even smaller increase compared to all customers. This
suggests the potential impacts of the fare change are more likely to be borne by non-minority and all
customers as a whole. Therefore, the proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount
does not present a Disparate Impact.
Disproportionate Burden Analysis (Low-income Customers)
The analysis found that low-income customers are expected to experience a slightly smaller average fare
increase than higher income customers and even a smaller increase compared to all customers. This
suggests the potential impacts of the fare change are more likely to be borne by higher income and all
customers as whole. Therefore, the proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount
does not present a Disproportionate Burden.

Considerations – MyRide Card Sales
A review of the MyRide card sales reports further suggests minimal impacts due to the overall low demand
for this fare product. In fact, the MyRide Stored Value accounts for 1.1% of total fare revenue in 2021 and
1.5% of total fare revenue in 2020. Furthermore, MyRide Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount sales have
dropped 80% and 56% (respectively) from January 2020 to December 2021.

Introduction
Background
RTD is proposing the elimination of the MyRide Smart Card Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount. RTD
introduced its current card-based smart card system in 2013. Initially, this system was only used for
institutional passes for employers, neighborhoods, and colleges. RTD introduced the first method of
electronic fare collection for use by individual customers in 2016, the MyRide stored value smart card. On
initial implementation, customers could purchase and reload MyRide cards at RTD’s sales outlets.
Additional sales channels (two major grocery store chains and online accounts) were added in late 2016
and in 2017.
Dating back to the 2016 fare structure, a per-trip discount ($0.20 per full fare 3-hour trip; $0.10 per halffare 3-hour trip) as well as free transfers were included to incentivize the use of electronic fare collection.
However, due to delays in implementation, RTD continued to offer free transfer on all 3-hour tickets and
continued to offer paper 10-ride ticket books with a similar per-trip discount. These policies were
continued using the current fare structure, which was implemented in 2019. However, the 2019 fare
structure does not include a per-trip MyRide price incentive for the two new discounts that were created
then, a separate youth discount and an income-based fare discount through RTD’s then-new LiVE
program1. The $0.20/$0.10 discount per 3-hour trip only applies to trips with full-fare MyRide cards and
half-fare “Discount MyRide” cards for seniors, individuals with disabilities, and Medicare card holders.
In late 2017, RTD added a new method of electronic fare collection, mobile ticketing, which was very well
received and now accounts for 19.4% of RTD’s fare revenue according to the February 2022 report. In
contrast, MyRide never fully took off due to inconveniences caused by technical limitations, especially
the fact that funds loaded online cannot be used for travel until the next day or later. At this time, RTD’s
current card-based system is end-of-life. RTD will replace it by adding account-based ticketing (ABT)
functionality and the option to use smart cards to the existing mobile platform. Customers will be able to
utilize the system through the RTD mobile app or physical smart cards. In addition to the fact that
decommissioning the old system is a technical necessity, the new system offers several customer
advantages. The new system includes real-time reflection of account balance, reloading, and fare
payments, as well as the option for fare capping (“best fare”). Fare capping provides flexibility for
customers to take advantage of the pricing and convenience of RTD’s day and monthly passes without
having to decide on a particular fare product in advance and without having to pay the full amount in
advance.
The current MyRide cards and current MyRide stored value are not compatible with the new system. RTD
will have to convert the current stored value to stored value in the new system, but due to the
incompatibility, this process will require some manual work and customers will have to take some action.
In order to make this process as seamless as possible for customers, RTD is proposing to discontinue the
sale and reload of MyRide cards and MyRide stored value in June, ahead of the installation of the new
validators that starts at the end of July 2022, which will render the current MyRide cards unusable.

Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) functional mission to provide
public transit services within the Denver area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the
benefits and adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or lowincome status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin
in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately
high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all fare changes to determine
whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income
populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document the proposed fare change and to identify
potential impacts to the communities RTD serves.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Disparate Impact Analysis: the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority persons as
a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be greater than
or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is defined as all persons
who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.
2. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by low-income
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be
greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. A low-income
population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health

If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential adverse effects. RTD will then analyze
the modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If
a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate
justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Proposed Fare Change
Description of Changes
The fare change proposes to eliminate the discount on MyRide Stored Value transactions. Currently, Full
Fare MyRide Stored Value transactions receive a $0.20 discount over the applicable 3-Hour Pass fare,
while Discount MyRide Stored Value transactions receive a $0.10 discount over the applicable 3-Hour Pass
fare. Youth and LiVE program customers receive no discount when using MyRide Stored Value. The
$0.20/$0.10 discount is fixed across all Service Types (Local, Regional, Airport). The decisions upon which
not to integrate MyRide Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount in the account-based ticketing fare system are
shown in Table 1.
Table 1: Considerations for Removing MyRide Store Value $0.20/$0.10 discount
Consideration

Detailed Explanation

Customer Experience

The current MyRide Stored Value product is a single-trip product. Fare is deducted from
the stored value balance each time a customer taps their card on a bus or rail platform
reader for the first boarding of a trip and when transferring to a higher-priced service level.
(Note that no fare is deducted for taps (transfers) at the same service level within 3 hours
of the first tap.) As a result, the customer cannot purchase daily or monthly passes (period
passes) on the MyRide card, affording potential savings. Additionally, single trips
purchased on a MyRide card do not accumulate to period passes, leading some customers
to pay more than if they had purchased a day or monthly pass.

Technology

Eliminating the MyRide Stored Value discount allows for a seamless transition from the
current card-based to the new Account-Based Ticketing system by simplifying fare
calculations. Moreover, RTD’s fare structure with multiple service types and fare levels
requires creating and maintaining a more complex algorithm to calculate and track fares.

Customer Service

Issuing product exchanges is cumbersome because of the inconsistent pricing between
other fare products (paper and mobile tickets) and the MyRide single trip. In addition, the
lack of a one-to-one exchange between products results in customer confusion and
additional manual work for Customer Care staff.
Fare Capping is an electronic fare collection system feature that calculates and charges
single trips and automatically accumulates single trips into period passes. Fare Capping
increases period pass affordability by allowing customers to purchase period passes in
smaller increments. As a result, customers have peace of mind that they are paying the
best fare available.

Fare Capping2

Analysis
Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated

from customers surveys. Customer survey analysis indicates whether minority and/or low-income
customers are disproportionately more likely to use the mode of service, payment type, or payment media
subject to the fare change.
The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely
affected by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., nonminority or non-low-income) who are adversely affected.3
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD’s Title VI Policies, RTD shall—
(i) Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
(ii) Review fares before the change and after the change;
(iii) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and overall
users; and
(iv) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and
overall users.4
A fare equity analysis compares the existing fare to proposed changes and calculates the absolute change
as well as the percent change. Using the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Threshold, a
determination will be made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are
disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also
used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit non-minority or non-low-income
populations.
Within this report, an Average Fare Analysis is undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed fare
changes on the average fare paid per boarding. The Average Fare Analysis determines whether the
changes disproportionately adversely impact minority or low-income customers or whether non-minority
or non-low-income customers disproportionately benefit from the changes.

Average Fare Analysis
The Average Fare Analysis for the elimination of the MyRide Stored Value discount was undertaken using
data from calendar year 2019, and therefore does not reflect the changes in ridership resulting from the
ongoing COVID pandemic. Calendar year 2019 ridership and revenue data formed the basis for the analysis
as it aligns with the 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2019 CSS). The 2019 CSS comports with the
FTA data requirements5 for conducting fare equity analyses (i.e., customer fare payment and demographic
information). The only changes considered in the Average Fare Analysis are those associated with the
changes in the average fare per boarding due to pricing changes; the Average Fare Analysis does not
assume any ridership changes due to application of fare elasticities.

1.E.2.a

Data Sources
Systemwide ridership and fare revenue data for 2019 used in the Average Fare Analysis was retrieved
from the National Transit Database (NTD). Only ridership and fare revenue for fixed route services was
considered; Access-a-Ride and other Demand Response services ridership and revenue was excluded.
MyRide Stored Value transactions for calendar 2019 were retrieved from RTD’s Business Intelligence
platform. Within the data warehouse, transactions are delineated by Customer Category (e.g., Full Fare,
Discount, Youth, LiVE) and Service Type (Local, Regional, Airport). With some additional analysis, MyRide
Stored Value boardings could be classified as first boardings, free transfers and upcharges. With this level
of delineation, MyRide Stored Value fare revenue could be calculated.
For customer demographic data, the analysis relied on the 2019 CSS, the most recent comprehensive, onboard customer survey undertaken by RTD that provides information on customer demographics and fare
payment. The 2019 CSS was undertaken by BBC Research, a contractor hired by RTD, whose research
surveyors conducted 3,811 surveys.

Customer Satisfaction Survey Assumptions
The 2019 CSS, while being the most recent and comprehensive on-board survey undertaken by RTD, does
have some limitations. Low response rates for MyRide Stored Value customers on certain Service Types
and by certain Rider Categories created some challenges. The Average Fare Analysis attempts to address
the limitations of the data by aggregating together the demographics for some MyRide Stored Value
customers.
The following demographic assumptions were used in the Average Fare Analysis:
●
●

Demographics for Regional MyRide Stored Value were aggregated with the demographics for
Airport MyRide Stored Value, due to too few survey responses.
Demographics for Seniors (65+) and Individuals with Disabilities were aggregated together, due
to both groups paying the same fare rates and experiencing identical pricing changes with the
proposed elimination of the MyRide Stored Value discount.

Racial/Ethnicity Assumptions
For purposes of the Fare Equity Analysis, minority populations are those who have not identified
themselves as “Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin” on the 2019 CSS. The analysis did not include
those who refused to respond to the racial/ethnicity question. The racial/ethnicity categories in the survey
include: African American/Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin,
Hispanic/Latino, Native American/Indian, and Other (please specify).

Income Assumptions
For purposes of the Disproportionate Burden Policy, RTD defines low-income populations as those whose
household income is at or below 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
Poverty Guidelines. To align with the 2019 CSS, the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines were used to determine
which populations would be considered low-income.

Table 2 provides the 2019 U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines and the corresponding RTD low-income definitions
by household size. Because the 2019 CSS asked both household income and household size, the Fare
Equity Analysis was able to use household size and income to categorize each individual survey
respondent accurately using U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines. Table 3 presents the income categories used in
the 2019 CSS. Because the 2019 CSS income categories are presented as ranges, all respondents within
the income ranges that corresponded to the 150% HHS Poverty Guidelines for income and household size
were identified as low-income. This may overstate the low-income population somewhat, but represents
the most inclusive low-income definition. The analysis did not include those survey respondents who
refused to respond to either of the household income and household size questions, as they could not be
properly categorized.

Average Fare Analysis Findings
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board adopted Title VI
Policies. While elimination of the MyRide Stored Value discount would result in a fare increase for some
populations, the systemwide change resulted in a 0.14% increase in the average fare. While all customer
populations are expected to see an increase in the average fare, the proposed fare changes are expected
to have a lesser impact on minority and low-income customers, and a greater impact on non-minority and

higher income customers. In no cases do the changes in average fare reach or exceed the RTD’s Disparate
Impact or Disproportionate Burden thresholds. As such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with
the implementation of the proposed fare changes based on the Average Fare Analysis.
The Average Fare Analysis provides an overview of the proposed fare changes. Appendix A provides the
detailed tables that provide the average fare change by minority and low-income status and by specific
fare payment method. The tables include the absolute and percentage change between existing and
proposed fares, and the proportion of minority and low-income customers that would be affected by each
fare change.
Table 4 provides the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for minority and non-minority
customers to all customers. For minority customers, the average fare would increase from $1.434 to
$1.436, a 0.09% increase. For non-minority customers, the average fare would increase from $1.444 to
$1.446, a 0.16% increase. For all customers, the average fare would increase from $1.441 to $1.443, a
0.14% increase. The percentage point difference between the percentage change for minority customers
and non-minority customers is -0.08%, indicating that while both groups would experience an increase in
their average fare, minority customers are expected to experience a slightly smaller increase than nonminority customers as a result of the proposed fare change. Additionally, the difference between Minority
and All Customers is even smaller at -0.05%. Applying this difference in average fare changes to RTD’s
Disparate Impact threshold, the fare change would not represent a Disparate Impact on minority
customers.

Fare Change Equity Analysis Conclusions
The proposed fare changes required a fare equity analysis to identify any potential disparate impacts on
minority customers and/or disproportionate burden on low-income customers. The technical analysis
using survey data found:
•
•

No potential disparate impact on minority customers associated with the MyRide Stored Value
discount elimination
No potential disproportionate burden on low-income customers associated with the MyRide
Stored Value discount elimination

The result of this equity analysis concludes that minority and low-income customers will not be limited or
denied the benefits of the proposed fare changes.

MyRide Stored Value Card Sales Considerations
The overall demand for MyRide Stored Value by RTD’s ridership have been extremely low and suggests
minimal impacts. In fact, the MyRide Stored Value accounts for 1.1% of total fare revenue in 2021 and
1.5% of total fare revenue in 2020. Furthermore, MyRide Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount sales have
dropped 80% and 56% (respectively) from January 2020 to December 2021 as shown in Figure 1.

2022 RTD MyRide Customer Survey
Supplemental to the fare equity analysis, a targeted survey was launched on March 23, 2022 to collect
feedback from customers of the considered changes to the MyRide program. The survey was utilized to
inform the equity analysis and to evaluate how the potential changes would affect existing customers.
The survey was sent via email and social media channels to 19,180 MyRide and LiVE customers and a total
of 2,490 responses were received indicating a 13% response rate. See Appendix B for the 2022 RTD
MyRide Customer Survey instrument.
Demographic Characteristics and Smartphone/Internet Access

•

Approximately 46 percent of participants were men, 47% were female, and 1% Non-Binary;
Approximately 25 percent of participants were non‐Hispanic whites; and
Approximately 20 percent of participants were low-income6;

Table 6 captures the response rates obtained from the survey questions that are relevant to the
assessment. Specifically, the survey suggests there is a high level of satisfaction with the MyRide discount
for 3-hour trips and the MyRide program. Additionally, over half of respondents are unlikely to use the
alternatives (e.g., 10-Ride Ticket Books or Monthly Pass) to the Full-Fare or Discount Fare MyRide card.
Participants were asked how frequently they ride RTD services and a majority (63%) are defined as
infrequent7 customers. This suggests that MyRide customers are not frequent enough to warrant the
purchase of 10-Ride Ticket Books or Monthly Pass. The most popular alternative was to purchase the 3hour or DayPass mobile ticket at 61 percent. Nearly all participants reported having a smartphone (96%),
a data plan with their cell phone provider (92%) and have access to wifi (95%). This suggests that the
alternative to purchase mobile tickets is a viable option and accessible for existing MyRide customers.
In conclusion, the survey results indicate there is a high satisfaction with the MyRide program and the
associated discounts for 3-hour trips. Although there is an unlikelihood with customers utilizing

Measures section. Additionally, customers who use the current MyRide stored value card will have the
option to switch to a new card on the new ABT fare collection system, which allows for fare capping. As
previously noted in Table 1, fare capping increases period pass affordability by allowing customers to
purchase period passes in smaller increments. As a result, customers will pay the best fare available.

Mitigation Measures and Public Outreach
Mitigation Measures
The findings of this analysis do not prompt RTD to consider possible measures to avoid, minimize, and/or
mitigate adverse impacts on minority or low-income customers. Albeit there were no adverse impacts
presented, the following provides an overview of the already-planned or implemented measures for the
MyRide transition:
•

•

Introduce mobile 10-ride ticket packs on the Masabi mobile ticketing platform with the same
pricing as the paper 10-ride ticket books or 10 trips with the current MyRide cards. This way
customers who use MyRide primarily for the $0.20/$0.10 discount and do not ride enough to
benefit from fare capping do not have to “go back to” paper if they want the same price. Note
that this price advantage only applies to full fare and Discount (senior/disability) fare, there is no
additional discount for using MyRide or 10-ride ticket books/packs for Youth and LiVE fares.
Introduction of mobile stored value on the Masabi platform as a payment method. Initially, mobile
stored value can be used as a payment method to buy mobile tickets. Once ABT is implemented,
customers will be able to use it for tap-and-ride as well.

Introduction of the “vendor portal” on the Masabi platform, which allows cash-paying customers
(or customers with credit/debit cards who prefer to purchase in-person) to buy mobile tickets or
mobile stored value at the RTD sales outlets.
Transition: “True up” the fund balance on the current full fare and Discount fare (senior/disability)
MyRide cards when creating the new Masabi stored value during transition, so customers can
take the number of trips that they expected when they loaded/re-loaded their current MyRide
card. For example, a full-fare MyRide card balance of $2.80 will translate into a $3 Masabi account
balance (i.e., old balance equates to new balance). Note that this does not apply to Youth and
LiVE MyRide cards since there is no additional “MyRide discount” for those.
New retail network targeting convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores for cash-paying
customers (or anyone who prefers to purchase in-person) after the initial implementation of ABT.
Paper LiVE 10-ride ticket books are now available for purchase by individuals, through all channels
where paper 10-ride ticket books are available

Public Outreach
Although there were no disparate impacts or disproportionate burdens identified in the Title VI equity
analysis, RTD has established a transition and conversion strategy which will inform current MyRide
customers of the program’s discontinuation, how they can transfer any existing MyRide balances for
future use on RTD, and the alternative fare products, discounts and tools that are available to them
moving forward. A mix of targeted outreach, in-system and on-vehicle assets, digital and social media,
community outreach and Public Relations will inform and educate not only MyRide customers, but all RTD
customers, employees, stakeholders, and the public, of the features and capabilities of the ABT system
and how their journey on RTD will be adapted and improved as a result of its implementation.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
CO 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Implementation

Committee Meeting Date:
May 10, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
May 24, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager, or her designee to enter into all
required contracts, IGAs and associated amendments, to design, construct, operate, and maintain the
RTD transit improvements along the CO 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project within Board approved
budgets for the CO 119 BRT Project.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry J. Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The CO 119 BRT project has been developed by RTD, in close collaboration with project stakeholders
since 2013, to provide cost-effective mobility improvements in the northwest area of the District. The
project includes bus queue bypass lanes along CO 119, BRT stations, Park-n-Rides, enhanced bus stops
within Boulder and Longmont and a commuter bikeway.
The overall project is governed by an executive oversight committee comprised of:
• Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) Region 4 Director
• Federal Highway Administration Division Administrator
• Boulder and Longmont mayors
• A Boulder County commissioner
• RTD General Manager and CEO
RTD’s 2022 Budget includes $5 million for the project, and the 2022 Mid Term Financial Plan (MTFP)
identifies $28 million in future years. Therefore, RTD’s contribution to the project is currently capped at
$33 million. With support from RTD, other agencies are actively applying for grants to facilitate
advancement of this project.
DISCUSSION
The CO 119 BRT project implementation is expected to require several contracts and IGAs over the
duration of the project. Some of these will be:
• IGAs with CDOT related to the project design and construction along the trunk segment of
CO 119
• IGAs related to RTD’s contribution to CO 52 queue bypass lanes
• Design and construction contracts

BACKGROUND
The Reimagine RTD project, which commenced in 2019, is a generational effort that includes RTD’s
first-ever System Optimization Plan (SOP) and a Mobility Plan for the Future (MP4F). The project has
reached a wide spectrum of stakeholders, customers, and public voices through outreach, engagement,
and communication. The recently approved final contract amendment with the project consultant
anticipates the Board’s consideration of the SOP and favorable approval of the MP4F in July 2022.
DISCUSSION
Reimagine RTD provides the opportunity for the agency not only to reimagine its fixed-route bus service
but to also answer the question of “what is next” for RTD. The presentation includes updates on all key
project elements, including:
• SOP status and plan for Board consideration
• RTD’s long-range financial picture
• What to anticipate in the MP4F
• Insights from public and stakeholder outreach
• The schedule leading to project conclusion

§ RTD operated more service than was financially sustainable in 2019 and deferred State of
Good Repair

§ Long-term financial projections indicate limited or no capacity to:
§ Grow bus or rail services
§ Make substantial capital investments
§ Complete any portion of FasTracks in the next 20 years

There is a significant gap between public/stakeholder expectations and desires
in terms of service and what RTD can afford now and into the future
