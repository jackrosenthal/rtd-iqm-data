LiVE Program Survey Results

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jeff Tranguch, Manager, Market Research
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) introduced an income-based fare discount program in July
2019, which was titled LiVE symbolizing “live your life.” This program offers income-eligible customers a
40% discount off the regular RTD fare. Customers looking to join the program must submit an
application through the Colorado PEAK website. Once approved, customers receive a LiVE proof of
eligibility identification card which they are required to show when using any of the following LiVE ticket
products: 3-hour pass on the Mobile Tickets app, Day Pass on the Mobile Tickets app, MyRide
reloadable fare card, and tickets issued by a government agency or nonprofit.
DISCUSSION
Upon crossing the one-year threshold of the LiVE Program’s implementation, RTD conducted a survey
among LiVE customers to understand their program experiences and determine opportunities to enhance
the program. The survey was available in English and Spanish with all responses due by November 25,
2020. RTD invited 6,579 customers whose application was approved within the previous 12 months
leading up to the survey. A total of 930 LiVE customers responded, 931 in English and 9 in Spanish. A
comprehensive report of the survey results and a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the results are
attached to this Board report.

RTD LiVE Program Survey Report

In July 2019, RTD introduced an income-based fare discount program, which was titled LiVE as in “live your life.”
This program offers income-eligible customers a 40% discount off the regular RTD fare. Customers looking to join
the Program must submit an application through the Colorado PEAK website. Once approved, customers receive a
LiVE proof of eligibility identification card which they are required to show when using any of the following LiVE
ticket products: 3-hour pass on the Mobile Tickets app, Day Pass on the Mobile Tickets app, MyRide reloadable fare
card, and tickets issued by a government agency or nonprofit.
With the Program in existence for a little over a year, RTD conducted a survey among customers to understand
their experiences with the Program and determine areas for improvement. This document provides a summary of
findings and recommendations from that survey.

Core Research Questions
•
•
•
•
•

How do customers discover the LiVE Program?
What are customers’ perceptions toward the LiVE application process?
What recommendations do customers have to improve the LiVE application process?
What LiVE ticket products do customers use most?
What additional LiVE ticket products might customers want?

Methodology
RTD conducted the survey from October 29, 20201 through November 25, 2020 via email2 and US mail. RTD invited
6,579 customers whose application was approved within the previous 12 months leading up to the survey. Each
customer was assigned a unique ID for tracking purposes and was categorized into one of the following categories: 3
•
•
•
•

Processed: Application approved, and proof of eligibility ID card sent to customer.
Waiting for Customer: Problem with application (usually picture); applicant has been contacted to rectify
the problem.
Problem: Other problem with application; applicant has been contacted to rectify problem.
Timed Out: Application has been in Problem or Waiting for Customer status for more than 60 days.

All survey materials (i.e., emails, letters, survey instrument) were translated into English and Spanish. As an
incentive, all customers who submitted a completed survey by the deadline were entered in a random drawing to
win one of twenty $50 gift cards to King Soopers.
The survey closed on November 25, 2020 with 930 responses, including 921 responses to the English version and
9 responses to the Spanish version. After removing duplicate IDs, 886 customers were included in the final analysis,
resulting in a response rate of 13% and a margin of error of ± 3.1% at a 95% confidence level.

1

To raise awareness of the survey and maximize response rates, RTD sent an email to LiVE customers on October 26, 2020.
To view the email announcement, please see the Appendix on page 21.
2
Approximately 80% (5,288) of LiVE customers have an email on file with RTD.
3 For a summary of the counts and percentages associated with these categories, please see the Appendix on page 20.

Attachment: LiVE Program Survey Report FINAL (4493 : LiVE Program Survey Results)

Background

1.B.2.a

•

LiVE customers are most likely to discover the program through a government agency or nonprofit
organization. 51% of respondents first learned of the LiVE Program through a government agency or
nonprofit. Following as the second and third most popular channels of discovery are word-of-mouth from a
friend or family member (14%) and the RTD website (12%).

•

Most LiVE customers personally completed their application. 73% of respondents personally completed
their LiVE application. 4% report a friend/family member completed an application on their behalf. Another
23% say a government agency or nonprofit completed their application; most of these respondents cite Denver
Human Services as the agency who assisted them.

•

Among those who personally completed a LiVE application, the majority are satisfied with their
experience during the process. 83% of respondents say they are satisfied with the LiVE application process
and 80% rate the process as easy. Respondents report similar satisfaction scores regarding the time it took to
have their application approved (84%), the time it took to receive their proof of eligibility ID card (82%),
customer service from RTD staff (80%), and customer service from Denver Human Services staff (78%).

•

LiVE customers typically do not experience issues during the application process. 85% of
respondents who personally completed an application did not experience problems during the process. Among
those who did, most cite issues surrounding the photo for their LiVE proof of eligibility ID card. More specifically,
respondents had trouble uploading ID photos and/or getting a photo approved.

•

Though most are generally satisfied with LiVE’s application process, qualitative analysis suggests
communication is an area for improvement. Improving communication surrounding application
requirements, application status, and general details of the program will improve the application process for
some. Additionally, some cite difficulty with finding the application, suggesting there may be room for improving
its visibility online.

•

Most LiVE customers used RTD services prior to the launch of the program. 93% of respondents used
RTD services before the LiVE Program, leaving 7% as new customers.

•

Prior to LiVE, most customers used the 3-hour pass from a bus farebox to ride RTD. 24% of
respondents used a 3-hour pass from a bus farebox to ride RTD before enrolling in LiVE. 10-Ride tickets and
Monthly Passes tie for the second and third most popular tickets at 11% each.

•

Once enrolled in LiVE, customers buy the Day Pass and 3-hour pass most often. Respondents report
using the Day Pass and 3-hour pass most often to ride RTD services (31% and 30%, respectively). 25% say
they use tickets issued to them from a government agency or nonprofit. The remaining 14% use the MyRide
reloadable card.

•

3 in 4 LiVE customers are satisfied with the current selection of ticket products. On a five-point
scale, 74% of respondents rate their satisfaction with LiVE’s selection of tickets as a 4 or a 5 (25% and 49%,
respectively). Still, qualitative data suggest respondents want RTD to offer additional ticket products through
the program. When asked for their preferred ticket product, the two most popular responses among those who
are dissatisfied with LiVE’s current ticket lineup are the Monthly pass (32%) and Day Pass (28%).

•

The specific details of the program, particularly ticketing, appears to be confusing for some
customers. Qualitative data suggest some respondents are confused about LiVE’s ticketing structure, including
how tickets can be purchased, where tickets can be purchased, and which tickets are available for purchase.
Others believe their LiVE proof of eligibility ID is their ticket. Furthermore, some respondents report getting
mixed messages from RTD about which tickets are available through the LiVE Program.

Executive Summary

1.B.2.a

•

By and large, LiVE customers are satisfied with their experiences applying to the program. To enhance the
customer experience, RTD should evaluate LiVE communications to determine areas of improvement. This can
be accomplished through qualitative research using focus groups and/or in-depth interviews with customers.
RTD should also collaborate with Colorado PEAK to simplify the process of finding the LiVE application as well
as explore ways to improve communication regarding a customer’s application status. Additionally, RTD should
evaluate internal LiVE communications to ensure consistency of messaging among employees.

•

The findings of this survey demonstrate government agencies and nonprofit organizations are an effective
resource for spreading awareness of the LiVE Program. RTD should consider expanding partnerships with such
organizations across the District to increase awareness and maximize utilization of the program.

•

While 3 in 4 customers are satisfied with LiVE’s current selection of ticket products, qualitative data suggest
many customers want RTD to add more products to its lineup. If RTD is evaluating the idea of introducing new
fare products within the LiVE Program, it should conduct secondary research to estimate the number of
customers that may be impacted by a decision. This will assist in determining if and where resources should
be allocated.

Attitudes Toward the Application Process
RTD included several scale questions to measure attitudes toward the LiVE application process. Each question
included a 5-point scale. RTD calculated top 2 box scores which summarize the proportion of respondents who
selected 4 or 5 (i.e., a favorable response). By and large, respondents express positive attitudes toward the
application process, with most top 2 box scores falling in the low to mid 80s. Figures 4 through 6 illustrate findings
from each rating scale question.

Recommendations to Improve the Application Process
To determine areas of improvement, RTD asked an open-ended question and coded responses into overarching
themes; most revolve around improving communication related to application requirements, application status, and
general details of the program. Further, some suggest improving the visibility of the application on the PEAK and
RTD websites. The next two pages highlight responses for each of these themes. Please note responses are
taken directly from the survey and have not been modified in any form.

If you can have a better explanation of what each stage in the application entails it will be great, since its
very confusing
Some of the instructions were not clear while applying. For example, uploading photo and documents were
confusing. It will be nice if the updates of the application process is sent by messages or updated in the
website. Otherwise the process is good.
Be more clear about what is needed and more timely notifying when things are needed like photos
I did my application through Colorado Peak the o ly real thing that would have been better is saying what
you need image wise before submitting the application. My first photo had been declined because I was
wearing sunglasses.
The "Upload Documents" prompt at the end of the application was really confusing for me. I had already
qualified for Health First Colorado, but I thought I had to upload proof of income again. I put off finishing
my application because I had a hard time getting logged in to my employer's online paystub system. It
would be really helpful if the final page of the application stated that I only had to upload a photo.

Improve Communication of Application Status

Maybe some way to provide updates during the process to provide status of the application.
It's a hassle I'm still not sure if I was approved for live rtd or not even though I have Medicaid ETC have
not heard nothing it's very confusing
Adding a feature to track the processing of a completed application would be very helpful. I received a
letter in the mail stating I had not uploaded a photo even though my application was already complete
and my card had been sent in the mail.
Application status emails. At the very least, an application received email.
been unemployed for over 6 months,on food stamps, applied to RTD live...sent in application with
photo...never heard a damn thing afterwords...walk everywhere now cuz cant afford $6 a day for a bus
pass while job hunting..program kinda sucks if you ask me to be honest..probably have to know the right
people i guess
I have filled out application. No body contacted about to progress
i never received the card or any correspondence after I filled out the application.

Improve Communication of LiVE Program Details
•
•
•
•
•
•

Be more detailed on how to use the Discount Card. What can + cannot be used with the discount card.
Be more specific about what all it includes.
Let the riders now that the myride card is also used with this program.
Display all rates including live. Explain what live is to customers and bus drivers. Sometimes even the rtd
security doesn't even know what the white card is.
The application process was clear about the program but need more details but other than that the online
process for me was not difficult.
The LiVE RTD application is something I believe is very easy to access. The information asked is something
that most adults or even minors should discover that his/her info is kept confidential.
Once, the
applucation process is completed, applicants should be given detailed info on how LiVE RTD works.
I
think applicants should be re-assured whether during the holidays or anytime of year that his/her
experience will be positive, riding the RTD should be an easy and safe ride.
Good wheater, snowy days,
RTD LiVE applicants should know that their applcation is a "Ticket-To-Ride"!

I remember having a problem figuring out where to find it on the website. I had to send an email or call
for instructions.
If possible make getting access to the application itself easier. I’m sure more people would be able to
become part of the program
In the beginning it was hard to find where exactly on the peak website it was
It seems for new users to be difficult to find the application online if they are going there from scratch for
the first time.
Make it easier to find on mobile devices
make it easier to find the application on the website. The RTD site lead to a dead link. It just says go to

Problems Experienced During the Application Process

To gauge what other tickets might be of interest, RTD asked respondents to evaluate a list of all RTD ticket products,
some of which are currently available through LiVE and some that are not. Respondents then chose the ticket they
would most likely use to ride RTD. Figure 13A highlights the findings from this question. The Day Pass on the app
and paper Monthly pass tie for first at 15% each. When combining preferences for the Day Pass (app and paper)
and Monthly pass (app and paper), we find 31% of respondents prefer the Day Pass (15%, 10%, and 6%) and
28% prefer the Monthly pass (15% and 13%).

(a score of 1,2, or 3), most (20%) want a paper Monthly pass. Another 13% prefer a Day Pass from the farebox.

All is well other than the prohibition of live card holders using legal tender
A Live monthly pass.
Add live to vending machines as I ride the trains and light rail more than the buses.
Allow day-passes to be purchased at the fare box or vending machines.
For live to offer monthly paper passes
Allow to pay cash on bus with live
Allowing access to LiVE tickets through an RTD farebox
also pay with money
a ticket on the bus because not everyone has a mobile phone.

Offer Cheaper Tickets/Greater Discounts

Decreasing the price on fare
Discounts available through LiVE program are not enough for me - I am unemployed with NO INCOME at
this time.
FREE
Give more of a discount
Giving a very fair price for using RTD. I don't like it, is same except more expensive than current Disability
discount. If RTD LiVE were lower bit down then Ill be satisfied.
Have military rate I.E. same as student rates
Lowering the ticket cost even further.
Make it a greater discount
make it cheaper for people with disability (or free)
Make it free for the homeless
Make the LiVE discount the same as the other discounts.

The following theme highlights confusion surrounding the details of the program, specifically ticketing. Respondents
seem unsure about how to purchase tickets, where to purchase tickets, or which tickets can be purchased through
the program. Some believe their LiVE proof of eligibility ID is their ticket. Others claim they receive mixed messages
from RTD regarding ticketing2.
Confusion Surrounding Details of Program

I was really confused the first time I used it. There wasn't much explanation of what the card was in my
case. I thought you loaded money to the LiVE card and scanned it getting on the bus. It took me a while
to figure it out because no one ever explained to me what I was getting. Other than that, I really appreciate
the service.
I used the LIVE ID for a month or two before I was told that I needed separate tickets. The bus driver that
humiliated me about not knowing and threw me off the bus never told me WHERE to get whatever tickets
he was talking about.I called the RTD for more info and was routed incorrectly and never did I ever figure
it out, so I just started paying full price again. I've had bitter feelings about this program since.
I don't understand I never received any tickets what tickets of these are you talking about how are you
supposed to receive these I'm doing all this via email no tickets.
I have never been able to use this service because I cannot figure it out. A simply worded informational
brochure would be helpful as would some sort of map locations where fare can be purchased.
Bus drivers be more informative and guidelines of the program. Throughout the year I have been told
different rules causing confusion leading to disagreement. I was told I could not use cash only live tickets
then another time I was told I had to use cash then other times I paid cash $1.50 for one way and $3.00
for all day???

(1) There are mixed-messages; some drivers and resources say that LIVE is only available by loading the
LIVE card, but your survey states a paper monthly pass is available.
Let people know that they need the Live prepaid card with the Id that was not clear to me and make it
easier for those on public assistance to get discount by allowing us to use the Live Id discount card with
cash since we can't use the ebt card on the RTD website.
I have not had a drive yet that accepted this even when showing my LiVE card I still didn't get any discounts.
If you could make the process easier and applicable for purchasing ANY RTD fair that would be very helpful
Alot of bis drivers asked for more info. About program that is why i stop using the card. I needed special
tickets .

Since the LiVE Survey was conducted during the spread of COVID-19, it is likely that the percentage of unemployed
respondents is higher than under typical circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Communications Report

Committee Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Pauletta Tonilas, Assistant General Manager, Communications
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Board of Directors holds a bi-monthly Communications and
Government Relations Committee meeting. The meeting is an opportunity for Communications
Department staff to provide the Board with an overview of communications activities and progress,
highlighting matters of particular interest to Board members. Staff also fields questions from Board
members or clarifies information as necessary.
DISCUSSION
Below are some of the notable communications highlights included in this committee report. A more
comprehensive overview is included in the attachment to this Board report.
• People Who Move People Campaign
The People Who Move People storytelling campaign launched in March as an ongoing effort to highlight
the agency’s employees, their individual stories, connections to RTD customers and how they move
people – physically and emotionally. From operators to mechanics, engineers to accountants, and
everyone in between, each employee plays a unique role in the agency’s mission to move people. A
short video featuring General Manager and CEO Debra Johnson kicked off the campaign, inviting the
public to meet some of the agency’s extraordinary team members.
• Enhanced Stakeholder Engagement for June Service Changes
Staff conducted several stakeholder listening sessions as part of the agency’s enhanced approach to
stakeholder engagement. The feedback helped inform the Proposed June Service Changes. Virtual public
meetings were held March 30 and 31 and recorded presentations in English and Spanish were made
available on the website for those who were unable to attend a public meeting. The next round of
stakeholder listening sessions will take place in late April/May to inform the September Service Change.
• 2021 Agency Profile and Fact Book
The 2021 Agency Profile and Fact Book is complete and available on the website. The document is a
year-in-review of how the agency responded during the extraordinary year of the pandemic and a lookahead to some highlights in the coming months. The report also provides facts and figures on key
agency projects and services.
• Improved Customer Connections
The first phase of the new Salesforce customer relationship management (CRM) system is complete.
This integrates phone and email systems used to respond to customer inquiries complaints and
commendations, as well as provides a much-enhanced tracking and monitoring system. Phase two,
which is tentatively scheduled to launch in the third quarter 2021, will improve outbound email

1.B.3

capabilities for public relations and marketing communications and offer customers the opportunity to
subscribe for Rider Alert text messages and sign up to get information about specific stations or stops.
Staff now can provide more comprehensive and robust reports on customer communications that come
through the Customer Care Division. A summary of Customer Care contact volume and most prevalent
types of comments/complaints will now be shared in this bi-monthly report. The below table details
activity during first quarter 2021:
First Quarter 2021 Customer Comments Overview
136,238 – Total Customer Interactions
1,297 – Complaints for internal research and follow-up as needed
109 – Commendations
Top 5 Complaint Types
265 – Face masks (highest complaints on 15/15L, 16, 0)
206 – Passenger passed at stop
180 – Bus/train late/early/no-show
167 – General discourtesy
91 – Not enough service/route or line suspended
• System Advertising Program
Staff is wrapping up the procurement process for the agency’s system advertising program, which will
build upon the existing on-vehicle advertising to include digital customer information displays at major
rail and bus stations. This approach is an opportunity to enhance the customer experience by offering
real-time customer information, trip planning, system alerts and information on agency events and
activities. Three proposals were received, and the evaluation team is finalizing the selection process.
Staff will present a recommendation for contract award to the Board in May or June 2021. The
successful contractor will deliver on-vehicle advertising as well as digital customer information signage
that will display customer information as well as advertising.
• Happy 5th Anniversary, University of Colorado A Line!
Hard to believe it’s been five years since the University of Colorado A Line opened to the public in April
2016. To commemorate the fifth anniversary, RTD and Denver Transit Partners/Denver Transit Operators
will mark the milestone with a masked, socially distanced press event at Denver Union Station on
Tuesday, April 27 at 10 a.m. Staff is also planning to celebrate the A Line through various
communications activities.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Government Relations Report

Committee Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) has a Government Relations Program facilitated and overseen
by the agency’s Government Relations Officer. Part of the role of the Government Relations Officer is to
coordinate and develop strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve
as a point of contact for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Below are the notable Government Relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since the last
Communications and Government Relations Committee meeting held on February 2, 2021.
Federal
Much of the focus for the last two months has been primarily on passing the American Rescue Plan Act
– the third pandemic related assistance bill. Included in the bill is $30.5 billion for transit nation-wide.
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is expected to release apportionments and guidance related to
that funding very soon. Additionally, Congress and the Administration have signaled that infrastructure
will be the next legislative priority to receive attention in Washington, DC. RTD will be engaging actively
with the agency’s Congressional Delegation as this process takes shape. Lastly, RTD communicated and
advocated for legislation to ensure a timely return of the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement
Financing (RRIF) Loan Credit Risk Premium. RTD and the City and County of Denver partnered on the
RRIF loan for the Denver Union Station redevelopment project, which was enormously successful. RTD
and Denver repaid the loan in 2017 – more than 20 years early – thereby fully extinguishing all potential
risks of loss to the federal government.
RTD seeks legislation that would require the Federal government to repay the $28.9 million (plus
interest) now. RTD’s Congressional Delegation unanimously supports the legislation and RTD is
appreciative of their efforts to ensure the recommended legislative language approved this year.
State
RTD worked closely with the authors of HB21-1186 Regional Transportation District Operations which
was introduced on March 4, 2021. The RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution with bill
amendments in support of the legislation on March 23, 2021. The bill was heard in its first hearing on
March 31, 2021. The other significant transportation related action at the state level was the release of
the state-wide transportation funding proposal. Formal legislation has not been introduced at this time.
With regards to transit, the proposal outlines funding for multi-modal uses and the projects will be
selected by metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs). The proposal also mentions funding to advance
the Front Range Rail as a future option for the state and has funding to assist in electrifying transit

Packet Pg. 78

1.B.4

operations. Lastly, RTD continues to monitor the General Assembly’s Regular Session for legislation that
impacts the agency and is working with our lobbyists to ensure bills moving through the legislative
process do not negatively RTD. Attached to this report is a matrix containing a status update on bills
that are of interest to RTD. Beginning on Friday, April 9, staff will distribute an updated matrix to keep
the Board apprised of the status of relevant state bills.
Local
Government Relations has been following local interests in the state transportation funding proposal. The
Metro Mayors Caucus has made recommendations requesting that 75% of new funding generated by
the proposal be distributed at the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) level. The Metro Mayors
Caucus argues that 84% of Colorado’s populations reside in the five MPO’s throughout the state,
therefore, it is reasonable to request at least 75% of the funding from new fees. The leaders of the
General Assembly released an overview of the proposal that suggested the bulk of the new funding
coming from the Highway Users Tax Fund (HUTF) will be split 60% state and 40% county/city.
On Saturday, March 27, 2021, the N Line Promotional Fare pilot program ended. This six-month
promotional fare was implemented in compliance with Federal Transit Administration regulations which
allow a promotional fare program to occur for a six-month period. Government Relations was among
staff providing information to N Line stakeholders who were interested in exploring options to maintain a
Local fare along the whole N Line.
