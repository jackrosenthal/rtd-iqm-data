It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the
Interim General Manager, or his designee, be authorized to enter into a contract
with First Transit for the provision of contracted fixed-route transit services in the
Boulder and Longmont areas. This package of service, named “Group 26”,
represents the re-bid of service currently operated by First Transit under a
contracted service package named “Group 22.”
This contract is for three years plus two one year extensions for a total of five
years. The total not-to-exceed five year contract total amount is $63,168,544 for
service and $7,019,978 for fuel. This recommendation represents the most
responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals
(RFP) 15-DH-064 to provide “Group 26” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on January 17, 2016.

performance for the current and additional services for three additional optional
years. The additional services are needed for SMT stored value system security
and high availability. Of the $1,440,000 contract value, the Board of Directors
approved $500,000 for these hosting services in March 2015 along with other
SMT items. The remaining $940,000 equates to $333,333 per year for the
remaining three years of the contract that will be funded in the 2016-2021
operating budget.

Contract Amendment; 2nd Optional Year of
2013-2015 Street Improvements & Shelter
Installations Contract; # 33DM005

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
amendment to initiate the second optional year of a three-year contract for the annual Street
Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $390,318.35. Funding
for this contract amendment is provided by the annual 2015 – 2016 Engineering Expense Budgets.
BACKGROUND
Due to the repetitive work of this contract, a three-year contract value was determined to be an
effective way to manage this work for the District. Bids were received and a contract was awarded to
Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in September of 2013. The
current base contract value and amendments are as follows:

Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and 2nd Optional Year $ 1,466,090.90
DISCUSSION
This second optional year amendment will increase the contract by $390,318.35, creating a total
contract amount, which includes this amendment, of $1,466,090.90. Manion Construction has
performed well throughout the term of this contract and has achieved all RTD requirements. The
contract enables work to be performed in a quick, responsive manner.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Estimated $390,318.35 budget shall come from the 2015 and 2016 Engineering Expense Budgets
dependent on the calendar year in which the work is performed.
DBE/SBE GOAL
Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second optional year of a
three-year contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with
Manion Construction, Inc. for $390,318.35. Funding for this contract amendment is provided by
the annual 2015 – 2016 Engineering Expense Budgets.
2. Delay the recommended action. This is not recommended as it will delay the construction of
projects that have been identified for repairs and impact coordination efforts with various
jurisdictions.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second year
option of a three-year contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract
with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead develop a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) for this year’s
construction work. This is not recommended because:
a.
b.
c.
d.

It would create a delay in constructing the 2015-2016 street improvements.
The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
The 2015-2016 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
The district desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.

Award of Contract for Group 26 Fixed Route
Service

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Interim General
Manager, or his designee, be authorized to enter into a contract with First Transit for the provision of
contracted fixed-route transit services in the Boulder and Longmont areas. This package of service,
named “Group 26”, represents the re-bid of service currently operated by First Transit under a
contracted service package named “Group 22.”
This contract is for three years plus two one year extensions for a total of five years. The total notto-exceed five year contract total amount is $63,168,544 for service and $7,019,978 for fuel. This
recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to
Request for Proposals (RFP) 15-DH-064 to provide “Group 26” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on January 17, 2016.
BACKGROUND:
As a result of a series of State legislative activities over the years, and in support of the Board
adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery, RTD outsources a
portion of the delivery of its fixed route bus service.
On May 1, 2015, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 15-DH-064 was issued soliciting proposals for the
provision of fixed-route transit services in the Boulder and Longmont areas. This package of services
was named “Group 26” and consists of 75 buses operating 15 routes providing approximately
188,679 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in “Group 26” is included as
Attachment A. Responses to the proposals were due on June 8, 2015. Proposers were required to
provide detailed operating plans for providing fixed-route service, including hiring and training
employees, maintaining RTD-provided transit vehicles, and conforming to RTD operating
requirements. The contract award was anticipated to be awarded on a fixed-price basis and based
on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.
DISCUSSION:
Four (4) proposals were received in response to RFP 15-DH-064 for the Provision of Group 26 Public
Transportation Services. Proposals were received from First Transit, MV Transportation, National
Express Transit, and Transdev.
The proposals were evaluated on the following evaluative criteria: a) understanding/approach and
organization for implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications and safety record (30%); c) price
(30%); and d) SBE plan and goal attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team consisted of Mike Gil, Deputy AGM, Bus Operations; Steve Gieske,
General Superintendent, Maintenance; Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; and

Packet Pg. 7

2.13.B

Greg Smith, Manager, Competitive Services. The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored
each proposal based on a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation and b)
experience/qualifications and safety record.
The SBE plan and goal attainment evaluation team consisted of Amanda Murray, Civil Rights
Specialist.
The scores for pricing were provided by the Procurement Department staff.
The following is a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the four proposals:
First Transit – First Transit was the highest rated proposal for technical understanding and experience
and qualifications. The key strengths of the First Transit proposal were the proposed management team.
Under this team’s leadership, the First Transit Boulder/Longmont division consistently meets/exceeds
RTD quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured positive and productive
relationships with Boulder and Longmont governments and communities. The team is experienced in
providing service for RTD and there will be no disruption of service when transitioning from the previous
“Group 22” contract to the new “Group 26” contract. First Transit proposed increases to the current
headcount in finance and operator instruction departments. The local operation is also supported by
experienced professionals at the Regional level.
Weaknesses of the First Transit proposal included the recent/relevant required experience of the
Operations Manager and no dedicated customer service representative position was identified.
MV Transportation - The strengths of the MV Transportation proposal included a reasonable start up
plan, module based training and some key personnel with previous RTD fixed-route experience. The MV
Transportation proposal was determined to be weak in the areas of the vehicle maintenance plan; facility
plan; and personnel plan.
National Express - The strengths of the National Express proposal included a reasonable recruitment plan
and approach to operations. The National Express proposal was determined to be weak in the areas of
the vehicle maintenance plan; facility plan; staffing plan; and the recent/relevant required experience of
the management team.
Transdev - The strengths of the Transdev proposal included previous experience providing RTD fixedroute service, a strong safety program, and approach to the operation. The Transdev proposal was
determined to be weak in the areas of facility plan; staffing plan; and the recent/relevant required
experience of some members of the management team.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The First Transit five-year cost was $5,269,015 less than the highest bid and $1,227,756 higher
than the lowest bid. Please see the Group 26 - Proposer Service Cost Summary below:

This contract is for an initial three-year amount not to exceed $36,553,933 with two (2) one-year
options in the amount of $13,042,297 (option year 1) and $13,572,314 (option year 2), for a total
five-year not-to-exceed amount of $63,168,544 for service. In addition, RTD will reimburse the
contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be approximately $4,087,413 for the initial
three-year contract term, $1,443,284 for option year 1, and $1,489,282 for option year 2, for a
total of $7,019,978 for the five-year period. This results in a total not-to-exceed contract amount of
$40,641,346 for the initial three year contract period and $70,188,522 for the five year period.
First Transit’s proposed first year price for “Group 26” is .8% lower than the current contract price
of the “Group 22” contract that it replaces. First Transit’s proposed hourly rates for the five-year
period of the proposed contract range from $62.43 (contract year 1) to $69.13 (contract year 5).
The hourly rates for RTD’s other current fixed-route contracts range from $60.06-$64.50 (current
contract year) to $65.30-$72.75 (contract year 5). The total five-year proposed price represents a
$2.6 million savings over the estimated cost for RTD to provide the service.
In addition to the hourly costs paid to the Contractor for the provision of service, the actual diesel
fuel costs incurred by the Contractor in the provision of the specified service will be paid by the
District through the contact. RTD will reimburse the actual cost for diesel fuel to the Contractor as a
separate cost item.

The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the estimated cost for RTD to
provide these services would be higher than the prices offered by the recommended service provider.
The estimated cost of internal operation was prepared by RTD’s Finance Department and is based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience
providing other fixed-route services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services
included in the “Group 26” service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating
and maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. This is done in order to evaluate the total cost that would be incurred by RTD to provide
the services. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services. The cost of providing facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance
base for First Transit’s provision of the services is included in First Transit’s Direct Service Cost as
shown in Attachment B.
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract will be included in the
requested 2016 RTD budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no impact

Packet Pg. 9

2.13.B

on the 2015 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future
years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to First Transit, as recommended
2)
Award the contract to the second ranked proposer (MV Transportation). This is not
recommended as it does not reflect the outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation
process and RTD’s procurement process.
3)
Resolicit the Group 26 service package. This is not recommended as the proposal
process has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive
than RTD is currently paying for the provision of these services, is less expensive than
the RTD internal cost estimate (ICE) and is less expensive than the estimated cost for
RTD to provide these services internally.

Subject:

US 36 BRT Service Plan - January 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the US 36 BRT (Flatiron Flyer) Service Plan package as revised and summarized in Attachment
A, resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $991,000 funded through FasTracks and, further, to
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
BACKGROUND
The US 36 corridor connects Boulder and downtown Denver via six stations along US Highway 36:
Westminster Center, Church Ranch, Broomfield, Flatiron, McCaslin, and Table Mesa. These stations are
accessible using highway on-ramps, off-ramps, or bus only lanes. Denver Union Station (DUS) is the
primary terminal for routes serving downtown Denver, while a single route (HX) serves Civic Center
Station (CCS) in Downtown Denver. Regional transit services have a few configurations for travelling
through Boulder after Table Mesa. Most routes on the corridor will terminate at Boulder Transit Center
(BTC) via Table Mesa Drive and Broadway Street with a connection to the University of Colorado
Boulder. A second, peak period only travel path, involves buses continuing westbound on US 36
traveling to East Boulder via 28th Avenue.
The US 36 corridor is currently served by a total of twelve routes: AB, BF, BMX, BV, BX, DM, HX, L,
LX, S, T, and 86X. All of these routes operate with high capacity, highway coaches, except for the 86X
which utilizes high capacity, articulated buses. Routes AB, L, and LX will not be a part of the service
plan recommendations but are evaluated as part of the existing conditions analysis.
The four B routes, BV, BF, BMX, BX, each represent a different service pattern between Boulder Transit
Center and Denver Union Station. BV is the all-stop service, providing a connection to each of the six
stations as well the local stops between Table Mesa and Boulder Transit Center. BV operates all day and
is oriented towards the reverse-commute, heading westbound to Boulder in the AM peak and eastbound
to Denver in the PM peak. BMX and BX are limited-stop express services that serve Boulder Transit
Center, Table Mesa, and McCaslin (BMX). These routes supplement BV service with each route
operating a 15 minute frequency during the peak periods. BF is a short-line route that connects
Broomfield, Church Ranch, and DUS. BF is a peak period service that operates in the peak direction,
eastbound to Denver in the AM peak and westbound to Broomfield in the PM peak.
Route 86X operates between Westminster Center and DUS. This route provides frequent, peak only
service, travelling eastbound during the AM peak and westbound towards Westminster during the PM
peak.
Routes S and HX are the only two routes that currently serve East Boulder. Route S provides reversecommute, peak period service between DUS and East Boulder while Route HX offers passengers a peak-

direction, alternative connection into downtown Denver, terminating at Civic Center Station. This is the
only route on the US 36 corridor that serves Civic Center Station.
Routes DM, and T are low frequency, peak period routes with unique terminals outside of downtown
Denver. Route DM serves the Anschutz Medical Campus, and Route T serves the Denver Tech Center.
Routes L and LX connect Denver and Longmont. These primarily peak-oriented services access the
corridor via the stations at Westminster, Broomfield, and DUS.
Route AB provides SkyRide service to Denver International Airport (DIA) from Boulder Transit Center
serving Table Mesa, McCaslin, Broomfield, and Westminster.
DISCUSSION
The US 36 Managed Lanes/Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project seeks to address US 36 traffic congestion
issues through physical highway improvements and transit service enhancements. The project involves
physical improvements such as the partial reconstruction of US 36 and the addition of two managed
lanes. These managed lanes will extend the existing HOV lane for high-occupancy vehicles and will also
allow single-occupancy vehicles to utilize the lanes by paying a toll. The construction project also adds
queue jump lanes at interchanges that serve the bus stations. The managed lanes and queue jump lanes
will improve BRT operations by incrementally reducing travel times and increasing service reliability. The
project will also include improvements to the existing US 36 bus stations, such as the construction of
new shelters, and added RTD operational funding; all to further enhance regional transit service along
the US 36 corridor between Denver and Boulder.
Pursuant to the Board policy on service changes, service plans for the implementation of the US 36 BRT
(Flatiron Flyer) and connecting transit network are included herein. The service plan aims to direct RTD’s
resources for the corridor in a manner that maximizes benefits for the agency and its customers.
Ridership growth will come from current customers making the same trip more often or new trips;
improved retention of current customers; and new customers making trips. The main guiding principles
for the development of the US36 BRT Service plan are:





Reduced travel time
Improved service reliability
Increase customer comprehension/ease of use
Match service levels with ridership demand

The immediate strategy is to simplify transit travel in the corridor by minimizing the number of different
services while providing spontaneous-use frequency where supported by market demand.
As a result, the resources for Routes BF, BMX, BV, BX, HX, S, T, and 86X are proposed to be
consolidated into four routes branded as the Flatiron Flyer:
1. All Station Denver-Boulder Transit Center (BTC) (All Station)
2. Express Denver-BTC (Ltd)
3. Denver-Westminster-Broomfield (DWB)
4. Boulder Junction-Civic Center (BJCC). Boulder Transit Center-Anschutz (DM) would be a BRT
route independent from the Flatiron Flyer Line
5. The fifth Flatiron Flyer route is the DM, which remains unchanged.

2.13.C

The US 36 BRT service is slated to begin January 17, 2016. While many suggestions for service
changes routinely are offered and considered, a formal public input process for the US 36 corridor began
with the Environmental Impact Study in late (November) 2003.
This included discussions with the public that determined the layout of the managed lanes from Table
Mesa to Pecos, as well as Bus Rapid Transit operations on those HOV lanes, and late on in the process
also included Bus-on-Shoulder operations, for routes serving all stations along the corridor. It also
included some minor local feeder route change suggestions.
The Preliminary US 36 BRT Service Plan was updated and taken to local governments and stakeholders
in late 2014 and to the public in early 2015. It was also available for anyone to review on RTD’s
Website. E-mail contacts were also made with local governments, including supplying them with links to
the preliminary draft plan. Revisions were made with the information gleaned from these sources and
the Draft Plan was brought to the RTD Board in February 2015 for review and permission to proceed to
public meetings for the US 36 Corridor service. The public meetings were held in April 2015 and further
revisions were made to the draft plan. Staff also met in this period with staff members of local
municipalities along the corridor, as well as other stakeholders such as Boulder, County, CU Boulder and
US 36 Commuting Solutions, to discuss potential adjustments in the corridor service. Throughout this
period, suggestions and questions from the general public and institutional stakeholders continued to be
received. Briefings with RTD Board members also continued during this period (April 2015 through June
2015) and adjustments to the Draft plan continued to be made during this period.
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
RTD held a total of 5 public hearings between March 16 and April 13, 2015 within the communities of
Boulder, Broomfield, Louisville and Westminster as well as Downtown Denver. Overall, more than 200
public citizens attended the hearings and gave a total of 77 verbal comments. A summary of these
comments can be found in Attachment B (Summary of Verbal Public Hearing Comments). In addition,
RTD received 189 comments via email (Attachment C: Summary of Electronically Received Public
Comments). Also received were several petitions and letters (Attachment D: Petitions and Letters
received). Staff assessed the key comments and based on input received, as well as additional analysis
conducted concluded that some changes to the initial plans were appropriate.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
US 36 BRT Service Plan. These changes were discussed with the Board at the June 9, 2015 Operations
and Customer Services Committee Meeting.
Route 206 – Pearl/Manhattan/Fairview High School: the proposal to increase in frequency from 30
minutes to 15 minutes in the peaks, has been rescinded to offset the cost of a new branch to BJCC
pattern (Rte S)
Route AB – Boulder/ Denver Airport (DIA): proposed routing change via Northwest Parkway and E-470
would be delayed until opening of A-Line to Denver Airport in Spring 2016
Route BJCC – Boulder Junction/ Civic Center Station: US 36 & East Flatiron Circle Station was added as
a new stop
Route DWB – Denver/Westminster/Broomfield: US 36 & Church Ranch Station was added as a new
stop

Packet Pg. 16

2.13.C

Route S: 3 AM peak and 3 PM reverse peak additional trips were proposed, as a branch of the new
BJCC pattern, in order to better directly serve the CU campus along Arapahoe and the Flatiron Business
Park
As a result of the consolidation of services, the five (5) identified related Flatiron Flyer BRT patterns
would be renamed as follows:
Route All-Station (BV): would become Route FF1- All-Station
Route Express (BMX): would become Route FF2 - Express
Route Denver/Broomfield (DWB): would become Route FF3 – Denver/ Broomfield
Route combination HX/S (BJCC): would become Route FF4 – Boulder/ Civic Center Station
Route DM would be considered a BRT route, but not as a part of the Flatiron Flyer Line routes; it would
remain as is and be renamed as follows:
Route DM (Boulder/ Anschutz Medical Campus): would become Route FF5 – Boulder/ Anschutz Medical
Campus
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Based on the Memorandum to the US 36 Mayors/Commissioners Coalition from July 18, 2012, an
agreement was reached as to the US 36 BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) Funding Levels. The major points of
agreement also included that service increase will be as ridership warrants, based on the RTD Service
Standards and funded by travel time savings on existing service resulting from the express lanes, and
Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding from the FasTracks plan (increasing commitment over time)
The O & M funding available for the US 36 BRT service assumed in the FasTracks financial plan is
shown below. These funding levels, along with the US 36 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) were
used to determine the service levels for opening day and beyond. In considering this service plan, the
FasTracks Financial Plan Operations and Maintenance Assumptions for years 2015 and 2016 were
combined, which provides the funding for the services slated for the January 17, 2016 implementation.
Subsequent years (2017 – 2019) are slightly out of balance, with budgeted resources being slightly less
than the projected cost for the service. However, by 2020 the financial plan provides a budget that is
slightly overfunded, and provides the capacity for additional service that may be warranted.

Proposed Service Plan
The immediate strategy is to simplify the corridor by minimizing the number of different
services while providing spontaneous-use frequency where supported by market demand.
As a result, the resources for Routes BF, BMX, BV, BX, DM, HX, S, T, and 86X have been
consolidated into five routes: the all-stop BRT service; the limited-stop BRT service; the
short-turn service (DWB); Boulder Junction at Depot Square (BJDS) to Center-Civic Center
(BJCC); and Boulder Transit Center to Anschutz (DM). The short-turn service provides a
connection between Broomfield, Church Ranch, Westminster Center, and DUS while the
limited-stop route connects DUS, McCaslin, Table Mesa, and BTC. BJCC service (Route
HX) will now offer 15 minute, bi-directional service during the peak periods to support the
new development in east Boulder. In addition, Route S will be maintained, as part of the
BJCC route, with 3 AM and 3 PM reverse-peak trips in order to continue direct service to
CU as well as Flatiron Business Park. Boulder-Anschutz (Route DM) will remain unchanged
from its present operation. The routes in the proposed service plan each have a unique role
and generate enough demand to warrant their inclusion on the corridor.

Service Enhancement/ Mixed Service Efficiencies
Route DM – Boulder/ Anschutz Medical Center
It is proposed to include Route DM in the US 36 BRT service category as a new pattern,
FF5.
There are no proposed service pattern changes and it will operate at 30 minute frequency
in the peak direction only. Minor runningtime adjustments will be made, due to the
possible usage of the managed lanes/HOV along the US 36 corridor.
Route S – Denver/ East Boulder
It is proposed to include Route S in the US 36 BRT service category as a deviation of the
BJCC. The Route would be renamed, FF6.
The number of trips would be 3 AM and 3 PM reverse-peak trips, versus the current 3 AM
and 4 PM reverse-peak trips. There are no proposed service pattern changes; however,
selected stops locations between 28th St & Arapahoe and Boulder Junction at Depot
Square Station will be identified, in order to provide more direct and shorter-trip time
service.

Service Additions
Route Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT
It is proposed to merge routes BV/BF, BX/BMX, HX, S, T and 86X into the new US 36
BRT, Flatiron Flyer Line and to create 4 separate new patterns, (FF1: All-Station), (FF2:
Express), (FF3:DWB), (FF4:BJCC). FF1 would operate from Downtown Boulder Station
serving selected stops along Broadway and Table Mesa, then all stations along US 36,
between US 36 & Table Mesa Station to US 36 & Sheridan Station and continue along I25 to Union Station. FF2 would operate between Downtown Boulder Station and Union
Station, with selected stops along Broadway and Table Mesa, as well as US 36 & Table
Mesa Station, US 36 & McCaslin Station and Union Station. FF3 would operate between
US 36 & Broomfield Station and Union Station, serving US 36 & Church Ranch, as well as
US 36 & Sheridan Station on the way. FF4 would provide service between Boulder
Junction at Depot Square Station and Civic Center Station. It would stop at selected stops
along Pearl Street and 28th Street, US 36 & Table Mesa Station, US 36 & McCaslin
Station, US 36 & E Flatiron Circle Station, US 36 & Sheridan Station and Civic Center
Station.
All- Station: Denver/ Boulder (FF1)
Previously referred to as Route BV, the all-station service will operate with 15 minute, bidirectional frequencies along the US 36 corridor, serving all of the US 36 stations (See
Proposed Weekday Schedule Eastbound and Proposed Weekday Schedule Westbound).
The 15 minute frequencies will foster all-day, spontaneous use. The routing of the new allstation service will remain unchanged from the existing Route BV service. This route will
be the spine of the corridor, providing passengers with a spontaneous use, all day service
in both directions. Passengers will know that this route will connect them to any station

on the corridor. This will set RTD up for success as the demand for intra-corridor
connectivity increases.
The all-station service is expected to utilize the Managed Lanes between Westminster
Center and DUS as well as between Cherryvale and McCaslin. At all other times, the allstation service will travel in the general lanes and will utilize the Shoulder Lanes when
traffic has slowed to less than 35 miles per hour.
Weekend service on the corridor will be provided exclusively by more frequent all-station
service since the market for express-stop service is reduced on the weekend. All-station
service will operate at 15 minute frequencies during the midday on Saturday and at 30
minute frequencies during the midday on Sunday.
The all station buses serve local stops between Boulder Transit Center and Table Mesa.
While these stops may add ridership, they also increase travel time and operating costs.
RTD and the City of Boulder will examine ridership along Table Mesa Drive and Broadway
to identify the costs and benefits of improved stop spacing and other transit priority
measures.
Express: Denver/ Boulder (FF2)
The Express route will connect DUS and Boulder Transit Center via McCaslin and Table
Mesa. This service will take on the role that is currently being filled by Routes BMX and
BX. An analysis of the existing conditions concluded that the ridership trends did not
support operating the two separate patterns. The express route will provide 10 minute, bidirectional service during the AM and PM peaks.
Express buses will use the new HOV/HOT managed lanes between Table Mesa and
Pecos/Westminster and the existing HOV/HOT lanes from there to Union Station. Under
free-running conditions the bus operator may choose to use the general purpose lanes
between Table Mesa and McCaslin.
DWB: Denver/ Broomfield (FF3)
The corridor will also feature additional trips between Broomfield, Church Ranch,
Westminster Center, and DUS during the peak periods in place of Routes 86X and BF.
These short trips will operate 15 minute frequencies in the AM peak heading eastbound
towards downtown Denver and 15 minute frequencies in the PM peak heading westbound
towards Broomfield. Combined with the All-Station and BJCC services, Westminster
Center and Broomfield will average 12 trips per hour or service every 5 minutes during
peak periods in the peak direction.
Route 86X is currently the most productive route on the corridor. This connection between
Westminster and DUS will be maintained but the resources for this service will be rebranded to unify the corridor.
Integration with local bus service and Call-n-Ride service will be essential to provide for
improved connectivity at the station stops. Station stops at Westminster Center and

Broomfield possess the most local bus service on the US 36 corridor. Broomfield operates
on a pulse-based system with departures occurring at 5 and 35 minutes after the hour. In
order to improve operating speeds, the BRT service should not hold at any station. The
corridor will offer frequent service that will minimize out-of-vehicle wait times and local
services will be tailored to meet the BRT service, if necessary.
BJCC: Boulder Junction/ Civic Center Station (FF4)
The Boulder Junction at Depot Square-Civic Center route (existing Routes HX) will now
also serve Westminster, E Flatiron Circle Station and Broomfield with 15 minute, bidirectional service during the peak periods along the current HX routing on 28th Street in
Boulder and 19th /20th Streets in Denver. Additional trips aim to serve demonstrated
growth on the HX and potential demand from land use development in Boulder around
Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station and along 30th St. These service levels will be
monitored closely after service opens to determine if additional service is warranted, as the
current and potential demand is not sufficient to support higher frequency or broader
service span for opening day.

Service Reductions
Route 206 – Pearl/ Manhattan/ Fairview High School
It is proposed to discontinue the route segment between 33rd Street/Pearl Street and
Boulder Transit Center due to low ridership averaging 8 passengers per service hour or 1.5
passengers per trip and duplicative service provided by route 205 and the HOP. Boulder
Junction at Depot Square Station, located just to the west of 33rd St & Pearl St will be the
new western terminal for this route. This is part of the recently revised Boulder
Transportation Master Plan.
Route T – Boulder/ Greenwood Village
It is proposed to discontinue Route T due to low ridership. Ridership per trip averages 23
passengers, which is less than half the required ridership. In-service hours from Route T
will be integrated into the Flatiron Flyer line.
70th & Broadway Park-n-Ride
With the integration of Route T into Route Flatiron Flyer (US 36 BRT), no regional routes
will continue to serve this location. It is proposed to close this Park-n-Ride with the
opening of US 36 BRT, due to very low usage of the facility by RTD patrons (15% of
capacity; 46/308). Local service connections for Routes 8, 31X and 72 will be provided
on-street at the intersection of 70th Avenue and Broadway.

Summary of Verbal Public Hearing Comments (Proposed US36 BRT Service Plan)

The following is a combined summary of the verbal comments made by 77 citizen commenters
at five (total) separate RTD public hearings regarding the Proposed US36 BRT Service Plan.
The five publicly advertised hearings were led by RTD Service Planning/Scheduling staff and
held on: March 16, 2015 (Boulder); March 26, 2015 (Broomfield); April 1, 2015 (Louisville); April
2, 2015 (Westminster); and April 13, 2015 (Denver). More than 200 general public citizens
attended the hearings. Each public hearing followed the same format with: introductions of staff
and elected officials, a staff presentation of the proposed US36 BRT service plan, a
question/answer period for clarifications, and the formal public comment period. Additional
public comments, not enumerated here, were also submitted to RTD staff separately in writing
and email (being taken thru May 1, 2015).
Boulder Hearing (Boulder Public Library, 6pm, 3/16/ 2015)
•

Commenter is a Boulder City Council member who wished to express concern about the service
proposal and made the following statements: The Flatiron Flyer is an inadequate service for
BRT. Steps on buses make the service inaccessible for many riders. Service represents a
$1.5B savings compared with rail. Service increase looks worse to Boulder. NW area cities
supported a train on I-225, not anticipating that their own service would be reduced. Highest
system farebox collections come from Boulder. Lack of midday and weekend service
between Boulder Junction and Denver is not acceptable, nor is the lack of service
between Boulder Junction and Denver Union Station. Requests RTD improve service along
the corridor.

•

Commenter represents U.S. 36 Commuting Solutions. Supportive of 15-minute all-station
service, new DWB route, 30-minute frequency on SkyRide via NW Parkway, service
connecting Boulder Junction and Civic Center Station, and all-day bi-directional service
along U.S. 36. Concerned about a reduction in frequency along Broadway corridor, elimination
of midday express service, longer travel times to Denver International Airport, elimination of
Route S, conversion of Route HX to local service, the lack of service between Union Station and
Boulder Junction, and the lack of service between Boulder Junction and Denver International
Airport.

•

Commenter is a small business owner in downtown Denver and a university student. Believes
there is a misconception of the level of service which will be provided along Broadway in
Boulder and that RTD should provide better communication with the University of
Colorado community to eliminate this misconception. Stated appreciation for the work of
RTD with local representatives.

•

Commenter questioned the absence of the District O RTD board member at the meeting.
Believes that using Route HX as a basis for planning other services is a bad technique and that
Boulder Junction will be a joke because service never runs there. Expressed disappointment in
a 10% reduction in capacity for bicycles on new buses. Believes cyclists will experience a loss
of capacity and questioned RTD’s failure to install three-position bike racks on its vehicles.

•

Commenter is the chair of the City of Boulder Planning Board, but is not speaking on its behalf.
Explained that many transit-oriented development projects are planned around Boulder Junction
at Depot Square and that the board faced significant pushback from the community during the
planning of these projects. Stated that the projects were approved with the understanding that a
significant transit presence would exist. Service proposal does not describe off-peak service
to Boulder Junction, nor does it include service to Denver’s Union Station or
International Airport. Stated that there is an untapped demand at Boulder Junction for
transit service which is not expressed in RTD’s projections.

•

Commenter is a representative of the Boulder Transportation Committee. Stated the importance
of the connection between Greater Denver and Boulder. Believes that there should be an
equitable distribution of funds throughout the district. Fewer transfers between vehicles
should be required, not more. Routes S and HX should be maintained. The investment in
U.S. 36 service should be increased. Direct service between Boulder Junction and Denver
Union Station should be created. Broadway service should be improved.

•

Commenter is the transportation director for Boulder County and spoke on the behalf of the
County. Stated that no one should receive worse service than it currently receives. Questioned
the balance of local versus express service along Broadway. Stressed the importance of service
to Boulder Junction and the East Boulder employment centers. RTD should not reduce service
anywhere. RTD Board should allocate increased funds to the corridor. Spoke positively about
the increase in all-day, all-station service at a local fare to support low-income riders, as well as
the option of an all-day pass at the price of a single fare. Stated that service should not be
reduced as a result of FasTracks.

•

Commenter believes that mass transportation is misunderstood by the State of Colorado.
Understands the challenging of serving a car-oriented area such as Metro Denver. RTD should
not be a challenge to its users. Sanity in the EcoPass program is recommended, eliminating the
confusing neighborhood-dependent nature of the program.

•

Commenter views the service proposal as a shuffling of RTD service. Looking for the rollout of a
flagship service along U.S. 36. Questions why RTD does not feel it has a mandate to provide
similar service along the corridor. Explained that land use decisions have been made based
upon transit service to allow for car-free and car-light lifestyles. Boulder deserves similar service

and timeframes as other corridors. Service should be increased to support the development
of Boulder Junction. WiFi and real-time information should be provided to customers.
•

Commenter manages a bus pass program for the University of Colorado and did not speak on
the behalf of the institution. Stated that students are responsible for 400,000 annual rides on
Route BV and that 25% of students do not leave their homes until after 9:00 A.M. Sacrificing
Routes BMX and BX does not help these riders and struggles to understand RTD’s logic for
discontinuing these routes. Recommended adjusting the end of the morning peak period to
10:00 A.M. Hopeful that new coaches will have improved wheelchair lifts to speed boarding.
Believes that the improved SkyRide service will be beneficial for students and that RTD should
continue to improve services for students.

•

Commenter was previously an intern at RTD and did not speak on RTD’s behalf. Complained
about riders who place their feet on seats. Explained the improvements on buses, including
increased legroom, stop announcements, and LED headlamps. Believes RTD does a good job.
Questioned lack of bi-directional express lanes on I-25.

•

Commenter questioned the logic of eliminating Route T which serves a geographically
unique area. Stated that travel time for Route T riders would increase to 2-2.5 hours.
Elimination of the route would cause people to leave Boulder County. Recommended RTD
maintain geographically unique routes.

•

Commenter recommended the retention of midday express service and the addition of
lifeline service at night (night owl service) along U.S. 36. Stated that the service span of
Route AB impacts the availability of flight choices for Boulder residents. Believes that stopping
at Flatiron Park and Ride is unnecessary for Route AB.

•

Commenter is a longtime RTD supporter, an EcoPass user, and was on the Boulder City
Council as it discussed FasTracks. Thanked RTD for the service improvements. Requests
improved service on Route AB and a reduction in fare for Route BV. Disappointed in the
reduction in service for Route BX. The marginal service between Boulder Junction and Denver
Union Station will doom it to failure, missing the pent up demand at Boulder Junction. Believes
that bicycle capacity should be increased, not decreased. Suggested that service seems to be
reallocated instead of increased proportionally as with other service areas. Expressed
disappointment with the loss of rail.

•

Commenter is a former RTD board member and the director of the Boulder Chamber of
Commerce. Expressed understanding for the challenges faced by RTD and believes transit
must be successful. Hopes to increase mobility through increased investment in transit service.
Believes that vision is necessary and that RTD should see this service plan as a successful
service. No service similar to the Flatiron Flyer currently exists, and the community is counting
on RTD to put sufficient service on the street.

•

Commenter spoke regarding the lack of service near the Boulder Junction development,
believing it is unacceptable for future demand. Regarding bicycles on U.S. 36, there is
sufficient demand for bicycles on buses. The new bikeway will increase demand for bike racks
on buses, especially for one-way bike commuters.

•

Commenter is a U.S. 36 rider who would like to see an increase in capacity for bicycles on
buses. Stated that there is an important connection between the East Flatiron Crossing Park
and Ride and Denver International Airport. Thanked RTD for bringing sanity to the BV schedule.

•

Commenter has been a transit rider for 35 years. Northwest corridor has supported transit for
many years, but believes that RTD only wants to do a good job instead of a great job for the
corridor. Stated that RTD should measure efficiency by how long it takes customers to travel
from door to door rather than the speed of a bus. A reasonable travel time should be
considered, as should the level of complexity required to complete a trip. Stressed RTD should
be cautious when consolidating boarding points as some passengers might not be able to
access the system. Expressed concern with the EcoPass program. Buses should be simple and
predictable for cyclists to board. Observed lines at Union Station during a recent snow event
and questioned the service proposal’s ability to handle such a service disruption.

•

Commenter lives and works in Boulder, riding the BX frequently. Concerned about the plan
and the loss of the off-peak Route BX service. Requests a direct connection between
Boulder Transit Center and Denver Union Station. Concerned that the new fare schedule
and increase might discourage ridership and make the EcoPass less attractive.

•

Commenter has been a Denver commuter since 1975, previously riding the Denver Boulder Bus
service. Appreciates the improvements in the U.S. 36 corridor for transit riders since 1975 and
rides Route HX. Thanked RTD for its responsiveness to changes in demand and hopes that
demand surveys will occur for service between Boulder Junction and Denver’s Union and Civic
Center Stations. Requested that FreeMetroRide be improved to provide off-peak service.

•

Commenter is a former mayor of the City of Boulder and a former Boulder County
Commissioner. Urged RTD to look at the project in the same way it viewed the rollout of light
rail. RTD took a vision to light rail, people looked at it and wanted more. RTD is looking at BRT
as an expansion of FasTrack, so U.S. 36 should be treated in the same way. People should
view this service as an example of future BRT in the region.

•

Commenter is a Boulder City Council member, appreciative of the new service. Played a role in
the downtown Boulder EcoPass program with 7,000 participants. Believes this service is an
opportunity for RTD to say thank you to Boulder for how it has accepted transit. Boulder feels it
is at the end of the road and that it is never going to get a train. Additional funding should be
invested here, especially given the transit oriented development at Boulder Junction. The city’s
commitment to density does not match the proposed service offered by RTD. Stated that RTD
should not predetermine if a route will be popular.

•

Commenter believes RTD needs to bring more funding to the table for this project. The process
of adding and removing service isn’t right. The Northwest corridor communities paid $28M for
FasTracks, but RTD is only offering $1M in additional service. Stated that the fare structure
between McCaslin and Boulder Transit Center is confusing. Stated that Route 206 augments
Route S, but only serves Flatiron Business Park. Believes that all proposed cuts should
be eliminated and that express service should be increased during peak periods. Route
AB service should be added at Boulder Junction.

Broomfield Hearing (George Di Ciero City & County Building, 6pm, 3/26/ 2015)
•

David Driscoll identified himself as a board member of ‘US36 Commuting Solutions’ and was
speaking on its Board’s behalf. He said he was concerned about the overall proposed operating
plan and its lack of more service. He said the US36 corridor contributes $20M in tax funding
annually to RTD but is receiving only $900K in new proposed BRT fastracks service. This is a
service inequity for the NW quadrant of the RTD district. More service should be added into the
US36 service plan.

•

Debra Basket identified herself as a staff member of the City/County of Broomfield and board
member of ‘US36 Commuting Solutions’. She said RTD staff had worked hard on the proposed
plan but that the overall service proposed was not enough. She said the ‘on-shoulder’ running
would be a benefit. She said no customer should have less service which parts of the plan had
proposed including: (1) the ‘DWB’ service pattern should be a ‘local fare’ (2) the FlatIron
PnR should have more service than was proposed in the Plan and (3) DEN Airport
service should be added to/from the Broomfield PnR.

•

Lee Robinson identified himself as a resident of Broomfield who lived adjacent to the FlatIron
PnR. He said he was most concerned that the existing HX pattern should continue to
serve the FlatIron PnR. He said: (1) HX was the most popular route serving the FlatIron PnR
(2) 20% (1/5) of the current HX route riders boarded at FltaIron PnR (3) the FlatIron PnR had
much better access to it than the nearby Broomfield PnR (4) Increasing development was
underway adjacent to the FlatIron PnR (5) the proposed plan eliminated the existing direct HX
connection to the Civic Center Station in Downtown Denver from FlatIrons PnR. Later in the
hearing Mr. Robinson reiterated that 20% of the current route HX pattern riders boarded at the
FlatIron PnR and that this was both a relatively large number and a significant number of riders.
He also said he knew there were many riders who said to him that they were very concerned
about the proposed reduction in service to Civic Center from FlatIrons PnR but that could not
attend the hearing.

•

Sharon Quigley was most concerned that the proposed HX pattern that she used would be
discontinued from the FlatIron PnR. She said the replacement service offered would take 2X
longer for her. She said she had moved to her current residence with the HX pattern in mind.
She said a 27 min trip currently would take up to 47 min. She said the fare on US36 should be
‘local’ fare.

•

Janet Michaels said she generally liked the proposed service plan. She liked the consolidated,
rationalized patterns. She said she could ride from the Broomfield PnR or nearby other PnR.
But, she said RTD should keep the (HX pattern) at FlatIron PnR.

•

Tom Mueller said the US36’s proposed ‘Limited Service Pattern’ should be a ‘limited’ fare (not a
local fare). He said the US36 plan proposed was inadequate in that it did not directly have a
fare plan attached to it.

•

Lisa Engleking was most concerned about the proposed elimination of the ‘S’ route
pattern. She said the proposed connecting bus service would take longer and require a
transfer. She said the E. Boulder area is experiencing dramatic current new development and
the ‘S’ should remain. She also was concerned that the ‘All-Station’ pattern proposed on US36
should use the inside ‘Express lanes’, not the outside or general traffic lanes.

•

Sean Salisbury expressed concern about the proposed elimination of the existing HX
pattern at the FlatIron PnR. He said he agreed with Lee Robinson’s comments (made earlier
during the hearing). He said the HX provides a current good, well used, connection to the Civic
Center Station in Denver – and it should be included in this service plan. The current plan
proposed would require a transfer in Downtown Denver from the ‘All-Station’ pattern to the ‘Mall
shuttle’ which operates too slowly. It would add 15 min. or more to his commute. He also
expressed concern that eliminating the HX pattern at FlatIrons PnR would negatively impact
adjacent retail/businesses. Later in the hearing Mr. Salisbury reiterated that there was
increasing new development occurring near the FlatIron PnR and that the HX pattern should
continue to serve the PnR and that expanding market.

•

Julie McCabe identified herself as a resident of Boulder. She was most concerned that no ‘realtime’ bus arrival information is yet available at RTD bus stops/PnRs. She said RTD was
forgetting about the customer. She also said RTD had generated $583M in tax receipts from
the NW RTD corridor since 2008 and over $60M per year. She said RTD was suffering from
FasTracks budget woes of being $1.5B overbudget. However, with FasTracks funding
shortfalls, only $135m was being given back in RTD funds to the corridor. She said the NW
corridor was receiving inequitable service and getting shortchanged by RTD.

•

Joe Rocoskey identified himself as a resident of Boulder and has been a rider since 1979.
Overall he said that RTD has managed service on the US36 corridor well over the years and
has made good incremental improvements. He said he was surprised how long the ‘T’
pattern had lasted already, but said it should be retained perhaps in the A.M. He was
generally supportive of the proposed service plan and said “We should give it a ‘try’”.

•

Michael Guidarelli identified himself as a resident of Lafayette and asked to know how the plan
would address the Town of Lafayette. (RTD’s Mr. Diaz asked him to stay after the hearing
portion of the meeting so he could answer his questions directly).

•

Debra Crawford said she lived near the FlatIron PnR and lived inside the City of Broomfield,
proper. She said she moved there for the RTD service, but said the Broomfield Call-n-Ride did
not specifically serve her address. She asked that the Broomfield Call-n-Ride be expanded to
serve her address.

Commenter objected to the cancellation of Route AB service to Broomfield Park and
Ride. Disliked the increased travel time between Broomfield and Denver International Airport.
Spoke of frequent car break-ins at the Flatiron Park and Ride. Believed Broomfield is being
shortchanged by these service changes. Disagreed with the argument that Northwest Parkway

will be a faster routing for Route AB due to the improved travel time along the U.S. 36 corridor.
Thanked Chairperson Sisk for his response to a complaint. Mentioned that it appears RTD’s
desire is to save money. If time is equal to money, the current routing of the AB is equal in
distance to the new routing along the Northwest Parkway. The commenter stated an additional
comment will also be offered in writing.
•

Commenter spoke of the positives of the bidirectional service. Stated that using Northwest
Parkway will help to eliminate the long travel time to the airport and will increase likelihood of
passengers riding Route AB to Denver International Airport. Concerned that the H bus will
actually increase in travel time. Appreciated that there are people at Flatiron Park and Ride who
would use the service, but recommends not increasing the travel time for others. Appreciated
the predictability of the new service, but does not believe that this predictability will actually
occur in practice. Frequent buses won’t necessarily show up at their scheduled time. Off-board
payment will be unfair for people who actually pay their fare because there are so many people
who currently use light rail and don’t pay their fare. Operators are so confused with the current
routings and changes to ramps along U.S. 36, operators are frequently missing their turns due
to constantly changing routings and interim roadway designs.

•

Executive director of U.S. 36 Commuting Solutions stated that formal comments from the group
were submitted to RTD. U.S. 36 service plan is the area’s contribution to FasTracks. Spoke
about need to receive benefit along the corridor from the tax investment from this service area.
Pleased by good attendance at the meeting. Stated that FasTracks should result in an
improvement in service for customers, not a reduction. Expected to see an improvement in
service around the Boulder Junction development. Concerned about the low level of service to
that emerging market, as well as others. Believed that RTD should maximize its investment
along the U.S. 36 express lanes. Expected a comparable investment in the region compared
with other areas in the RTD area. Appreciated working with RTD staff on the plan. Viewed 15minute all-day, 10-minute peak frequency at all stations as an improvement. Appreciated the
service from Broomfield and Sheridan. Liked the rerouting of AB. Lack of service… (3 minutes
elapsed)

•

Louisville resident and RTD rider believed they are receiving a “triple whammy”. Expected a rail
line and isn’t going to get it. Carpool lanes are being changed from 2 to 3 people. BRT is
reducing service, specifically to Civic Center. Service between Superior and Civic Center is
getting worse as a result of the plan. Additional stops at Westminster increases service for that
area which is also getting rail service. Not fair that they are getting better service while the north
end of the service area is getting worse service. Spoke about the capacity of the Park and Ride
on both sides of the U.S. 36 freeway. Additional stops between Superior and Civic Center
Station unnecessary. Recommended staff be flexible to adjust for new travel times. Noted an
increase in flexibility along U.S. 36, but not for others. Suggested the reconsideration of the
elimination of the Superior Park and Ride.

•

Louisville resident rides Route H to Civic Center. Stated displeasure about the lack of rail
service along the corridor. Questioned whether travel times will decrease to Civic Center
Station. Believed recent changes actually increased travel times. Supported the reinstatement
of stops at Flatiron Park and Ride.

•

Broomfield resident stated that SkyRide service along Route AB should continue to
Broomfield given the number of connection points at that facility. Reduces the number of
transfers required to get to Denver International Airport. Recommended RTD continue to serve
Broomfield.

•

Superior resident who travels from McCaslin to Union Station was okay with the use of buses
instead trains. Believed the express flexibility of buses is good. Stated pleasure with how snow
day service serves every stop. Expressed excitement about the changes and the reliable
service, as well as the reduced travel time to the airport.

•

Commenter spoke on behalf of the City of Louisville and had previously submitted comments to
RTD. Liked all-station service and the increase in frequency throughout the day. Appreciated
the new airport service routing. Believes RTD is simply shuffling service around rather than
creating new service. Louisville feels strongly that there should be no reduction in service
through the FasTracks program and will continue to have conversations with RTD.

•

Boulder resident agreed with others who wished to increase the transit investment in this part of
the region. Believed it was important to continue serving the area. Believed there will be a
decrease in midday express service and hoped to see more frequent express service midday.
HX is always full at Table Mesa and recommended it be an express service. Wants 5-minute
frequency along U.S. 36.

•

Louisville resident would like an increase in the number of Route AB buses, especially during
school breaks. Asked that RTD increase frequency or have other buses waiting in the cases of
overloads. Route AB is extremely chaotic during break times. Suggested additional weekend
service on Route AB.

•

Commenter supported additional midday service for students, teachers, and others who work
non-standard hours. Recommended RTD use smaller vehicles for midday express service
rather than to eliminate it.

Louisville resident stated that waiting for the bus at Island 5 at Denver International Airport is

Westminster Hearing (City Park Recreation Center, 6pm, 4/2/ 2015)
•

Craig Coon identified himself as a member of the US36 Commuting Solutions board. He stated
the proposed service plan had good elements including: bi-directional 15-minute headways on
weekdays and Saturdays, and additional Broomfield/Westminster frequencies in peakhours/peak-direction to/from Union Station. However, he said that RTD should add more
funding to the plan to serve large new/expanding rider markets currently being built in the
corridor including: (a) more service at Boulder Junction and (b) one-seat DIA-Broomfield
service.

•

Emily Nowicki urged that the ‘T’ route pattern be retained. She explained she rode the ‘T’
from Westminster to the Tech Center regularly and worked at Oracle. When the ‘T’ had been

proposed for elimination in the past, she tried various alternative RTD rail and bus alternatives
but each took far longer than the ‘T’.
•

James Stetterberg explained he was an RTD operator and operated the AB route often. He
urged that the AB continue at Westminster PnR as many DIA workers rely on that service
to get to/from work at DIA.

•

Connie Wolff explained that she worked at DIA and relied on the ‘AB’ at Westminster PnR. She
said that she and others would face longer commute times than currently exists and that the AB
should be retained at the Westminster PnR.

•

Aric Otzelberger identified himself as paid staff of the City of Westminster and that he was
speaking for the City. He explained the City appreciated RTD’s hard work in crafting the
proposed US36 Service Plan and liked several elements including: all-day 15-minute bidirectional service at all stations - including Church Ranch PnR. However, he said the City was
asking RTD to add more resources, specifically, so the ‘AB’ remained at Westminster PnR
with one-seat service to/from DIA. The replacement service would take longer and the
proposed discontinuance of the AB at the Westminster PnR was a significant loss for the City
that should be changed.

•

Cory Lacert explained he was speaking for his company, employing 485 people, at the FlatIron
Business Park in East Boulder, currently served by the ‘S’ route pattern. He said his company
provides RTD transit passes to its employees, many of whom rely on the ‘S’. He urged for the
‘S’ should remain as it benefitted adjacent communities, such as Westminster, by
allowing employees to live in Westminster and access jobs in East Boulder. He said he
was cyclist and riding a bike would become more cumbersome with the proposed transfer that
would be required if the ‘S’ would be discontinued.

•

Clayton Dean urged RTD to keep the ‘T’ route pattern as part the US36 service plan. He
said that RTD was incorrectly pushing riders away when it should instead be expanding rider
options. He said the ‘T’ should instead be promoted so that it could expand in the future and
make it better.

•

Cathy Voecks urged RTD not to eliminate the ‘T’ route pattern. She said light rail is slow
and the replacement trip, including transfers, for her will take much longer. She added that
since the fare study was not yet decided, she was concerned her replacement trip would require
she need to also pay two fares, one for bus, and another for light rail to complete her trip. She
said ‘T’ drivers also needed more training to drive the speed limit when possible as they often
operated too slowly on the I-25 HOV lanes.

•

Glen November explained that he worked at Ball Aerospace. He urged that the AB continue
at Westminster PnR and that discontinuing it was wrong. He also urged that the ‘HX’ route
pattern (‘BJCC’) serve Church Ranch PnR.

•

Tracy Kraft-Tharp (State Representative) complained that RTD had incorrectly not included the
Fare Study as an intended component of this US36 Service Plan Hearing. She said she had
been led to believe this would be the case and apologized for informing any of her constituents

2.13.C.b

that this meeting would also be about the Fare Study. She said the proposed US36 Service
Plan was a big change along with a fare change. She said she was dismayed at the lack of
consideration showed by RTD in that it was requiring citizens to attend two separate public
meetings and unfair to citizens’ time.
•

Paula Fossum urged RTD to keep the AB at Broomfield PnR. She said that the proposed
replacement service, requiring a transfer at the FlatIron PnR, would require needless,
cumbersome luggage transfers for riders and drivers alike.

•

Emma Pinter (Westminster City Council) reiterated the City of Westminster’s position that
retaining ‘AB’ service at Westminster PnR was of significant importance to the City. She
also expressed her concern about the proposed discontinuance of the ‘T’ route pattern.

•

Ryan Nee identified himself as a formally representing a large employer (‘Markit’) based in East
Boulder. He stated the company had 500 employees covered by employer transit pass
programs. He stated transit’s importance for many employees who live in the City of Denver.
He specifically said that proposed elimination of the ‘S’ route pattern would be an
inconvenience as it currently is a one-seat ride that should be retained. He also stated that
any timed transfer to/from route 206 at Boulder Junction needs to be made more via more
reliable206schedules.

•

Mary Fossum stated that she worked at the Denver Airport and that she relied on the current AB
route from Westminster. She stated that the AB at Westminster should be retained and that
there were many other employees who boarded the AB at Westminster and Broomfield that
would be left hanging in the breeze and negatively affected. She pointed out that the proposed
replacement location for the AB in Broomfield, serving its FlatIrons PnR instead of the
Broomfield PnR, did not have covered parking, which was another downgrade.

•

Kim Zilis stated that the current HX route, at FlatIrons PnR, has often been standing room
only. The loss of FlatIrons PnR, on the BJCC (HX) route pattern, was a wrong and it should be
added back into the plan.

•

Kuan-Hsuen Lee stated that he was a university student in Denver and that he liked the
proposed plan and the new service ideas and concepts in it. He said he thought that more
advertising and promotion of the ‘Metro Ride’ route in Denver could be used to help offset some
riders’ concerns regarding the proposed loss of the one-seat ride to Civic Center Station from
the FlatIrons PnR.

•

Helen Bushnell said she was happy about the service plan and glad it was finally going to
happen. She urged that the fare should be ‘Local’ along the corridor - especially at Broomfield
PnR. She also added that it needs to be made easier to walk, and use wheelchairs, near PnRs
along the corridor. She said RTD needs more outreach to diverse rider groups, including those
who ride the #206 route.

•

David Cook said he was speaking for himself and not CU-Boulder, where he works. He
thanked RTD staff for its hard work in crafting the propose service plan for US36. He said
however that RTD should add more FasTracks funds to the corridor to increase service on it.

He also said the plan has, in certain instances, times where it offers fewer trips than currently
exist at peak of the peak hours. He said this would crowd buses as certain times and affect bike
capacity. He urged that the route ‘S’ pattern be retained – especially at a time when there is
increasing development on E. Arapahoe Rd, a recently opened Hospital complex, and Ball
Aerospace expansion.
•

Bradley Kohler said he worked at the Denver Airport and regularly rode the AB from the
Westminster PnR. He said the proposed elimination of the AB at Westminster was a
problem and would require a significantly longer travel time on the future US36 BRT to DIA rail
transfer – or the NW rail transfer to DIA rail. He added that there was already a bike and
luggage capacity problem on the AB bus that will only get worse. He said that there would be
a 5-6 month gap in DIA service from Westminster entirely, if the AB ended in January, but
if NW rail did not start until the summer.

•

Patrick Ricard said he liked the service plan in that it offered a significant benefit to ‘reversecommute’ riders, like himself, going into Boulder to work. He added that the existing mid-day
express pattern should be retained. He urged RTD to carefully consider the ‘BJCC’ (HX) route
pattern should avoid Rockies baseball game day delays in Downtown Denver.

•

James Wadell said he was a member of Boulder’s ‘B-Cycle’ group. He said the route ‘S’
pattern should remain and that it was not frequent enough. He said the BJCC route should
operate via Foothills Pkwy in Boulder, vs 28th St, to/from Boulder Junction station.

communities have made along the corridor, fares for FasTracks related service should
be priced the same across the system, regardless of whether it is bus or rail-based,

I would like to respectfully suggest that changing the limit for carpooling from two to
three riders for free use of the toll lanes will significantly reduce carpooling from Boulder
to Denver. Currently, I carpool approximately three days per week, and it is very rare to
have two passengers along with myself. Many others in my company also carpool from
Denver to Boulder; however, we all have varied schedules, so it is not usually feasible to
have three people in a carpool. With the exorbitant rates that are being proposed for the
toll lanes and the change from two people to three people for high occupancy, this will
inevitably result in more vehicles in the regular lanes. I am sure that this situation is not
unique to me and my colleagues, and the result of increasing the carpool occupancy from
two to three will be that many cars with two people will now be using the regular lanes.
Based on my use of the HOV lanes, there is not an issue with congestion of these lanes,
so I do not understand why this limit would be increased from two to three other than to
force more people to pay the toll. In summary, the proposal to increase the HOV
definition from two to three people per vehicle will result in under-utilized toll lanes and
more congestion in the regular lanes. If the project partners really wanted to encourage
carpooling, they would not be making this change.
Thank you for consideration of these comments. If there are any questions, I can be
contacted at 303-480-1700 or aearles@wrightwater.com.

To whom it may concern:
I am writing as a student at the University of Colorado School of Law regarding the Regional
Transportation District. My classmates and I are concerned about RTD’s proposed route changes
that will leave CU off the list of express bus stops. Furthermore, many of us are dissatisfied with
the existing service that RTD provides, and some of us do not use it at all. We all, however, are
required to pay for it as part of our tuition.
Accordingly, we request that RTD use this opportunity for change to also examine the
functionality that it currently provides to the CU community.
I have a background in transportation management and a strong interest in urban and regional
planning. I also spent most of my life in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I frequently utilized
the BART and Caltrain services. I am speaking for many of my fellow students when I say that
we support the idea of reliable, affordable, and speedy mass transit. We also recognize the
benefits of mass transit regarding the environment and traffic congestion. Here, however, we are
forced into a situation of choosing between unreliable and inconvenient transportation that we
have already unwillingly paid for, or incurring additional transportation expenses.
I have personally had an RTD bus break down on the way to a job interview, which made me
significantly late. My already long one and a half hour commute from Denver to Boulder has
taken as long as three hours due to mysteriously absent or severely delayed buses. These stories
are hardly unique among my classmates. These types of issues can be a serious barrier to the
ability of students to attend law school-related events and arrive at classes on time. Ultimately,
RTD causes problems for us that do not reflect well on CU Law as an institution, or on its
students.
Many students at CU Law rely on RTD for their daily transportation, and any changes that
further threaten our ability to get where we need to go when we need to get there will be severely
problematic for us.
We eagerly await your response.
Sincerely,

Re: Written Supplement to Comments at 3/26/2015 Broomfield Public Hearing on

Dear RTD Board and Staff:

community in Broomfield. I thank the RTD staff for providing me with the opportunity to
speak at last week’s public hearing in Broomfield about my concerns with the proposed
US 36 Bus Rapid Transit Service Plan (the “Plan”). I understand and respect that the
RTD staff has worked hard to gather data and draft the Plan, but, as discussed below, I
believe the data in the Plan and elsewhere shows that Civic Center service should be
kept at US 36-Flatiron Park-N-Ride (“36-Flatiron”).
I have been a Route HX rider since November 2003, and I have used the 36Flatiron stop to commute to my job at 19th and Stout in Denver since the HX began
service at 36-Flatiron approximately seven years ago. My personal observation from
regularly riding the HX over the years is that during peak morning commute times
(7:00am-7:45am), the 36-Flatiron stop has been a popular option for downtown Denver
commuters. Following its pickup at 36-Flatiron, the HX is usually near capacity and
often with standing room only on Tuesdays. Based on these personal observations, I
believe there is adequate demand to continue Civic Center service at 36-Flatiron. I also
question whether the proposed Boulder Junction-Civic Center route (“BJCC”) will be
able to accommodate the rider demand as a single line with additional stops at the busy
36-Broomfield and 36-Sheridan Park-N-Rides.
Perhaps more importantly, the data in Plan itself justifies continued Civic Center
service at 36-Flatiron.

• Figures 7 and 8 of the Plan reflect that a majority (approx. 55%) of 36-Flatiron
passengers prefer to take the HX route to Civic Center, not the BV to Union Station.
Indeed, the HX is the most popular bus route at 36-Flatiron. That statistic alone calls
into question the Plan’s proposal to eliminate the most popular route at 36-Flatiron
and leave a less utilized route.

only on the assessment that the “Flatiron and Church Ranch Station are the least
active stations on the US 36 corridor.” See Plan p. 34. But, I respectfully observe,
the RTD staff has drawn an incorrect conclusion from the data in the Plan with
respect to Civic Center service at 36-Flatiron. As it relates to the HX line, 36-Flatiron
is not an underutilized stop for Civic Center service. Although the 36-Flatiron
stop has less total boarding activity in absolute terms than other Park-N-Rides on US
36, when it comes to Civic Center service, the data in Figure 7, Figure 11, and Figure
14 of the Plan show that approximately 20% (1/5) of current HX passengers board at
36-Flatiron.1 Given that the HX makes five stops before reaching downtown, the stop
at 36-Flatiron is used as much, if not more, than other stops along the route.
Accordingly, there is absolutely no justification in the data collected by RTD in the
Plan to eliminate 36-Flatiron as an underutilized stop for Civic Center service.

• The data in the Plan also reflects that the elimination of 36-Flatiron Civic Center
service could create capacity problems at other Park-N-Rides in terms of available
parking. According to Figure 14 of the Plan, although there is currently abundant
parking at 36-Flatiron, 36-McCaslin Park-N-Ride is at 86% of parking capacity, leaving
only 65 available parking spaces. A large number of HX riders at 36-Flatiron park at
the private parking lot on the mall side of US 36 and not the Park-N-Ride itself. As
such, Figure 14 does not adequately reflect the true number of cars that would have
to be shifted to other Park-N-Rides. If even half of the current HX riders at 36-Flatiron
(approx. 71) decide to depart from 36-McCaslin for Civic Center service, there will be
inadequate parking capacity at 36-McCaslin. In addition, there will be absolutely no
room for growth (such as for the proposed and in construction mixed-use Superior
Town Center just off McCaslin). Accordingly, the RTD parking lot capacity data set
forth in the Plan also supports retaining the existing Civic Center service at 36Flatiron.
In addition, my personal experience and observation is that the 36-Flatiron stop
is a utilized and convenient drop off point for “kiss and go” riders who share cars with
their spouses/partners. That is because the 36-Flatiron parking lot is located very close
to the exit ramps on US 36, unlike both 36-Broomfield and 36-McCaslin. Those other
stops have convoluted entrance/exit patterns for passenger pickup on both sides and
inadequate visible parking spots for cars waiting for passengers. Thus, the 36-Flatiron
route to Civic Center should be maintained and promoted as an excellent place for
people to practice car-sharing for commuting to downtown Denver and to increase RTD
ridership. This advances RTD’s mission and the promise and spirit of FasTracks.
Finally, while the data and observations set forth above already provide
compelling evidence that continued Civic Center service at 36-Flatiron is warranted by
existing demand, residential patterns surrounding the 36-Flatiron stop also show that
1 Per Figure 7, approximately 55% of 36-Flatiron riders take the HX. According to Figure 11, that would be

approximately 142 riders (259 x 55%). Thus, according to Figure 11, HX ridership from 36-Flatiron is about 21.8%
(142/649).

demand for enhanced commuter options will only increase, not diminish. According to a
recent article in the Broomfield Enterprise (10/29/14), the Broomfield Planning and
Zoning Commission has already approved construction of 1,403 apartment units, 59
condos, and a 100+ room hotel in the Via Varra area within a short walking distance to
36-Flatiron, many of which are already built. Indeed, in the last several months alone,
the Broomfield Planning and Zoning Commission has approved the construction of 388
new residential units in the Via Varra community. As such, the residential growth
patterns in Broomfield and Superior demonstrate that 36-Flatiron service to Civic Center
should be retained to support high-density residential development and growth in
Broomfield and to accommodate US 36 corridor commuters in a fashion they have
come to expect from RTD, especially under FasTracks.
Based on the foregoing, I respectfully suggest one of the following modifications
to the Plan to provide a better level of service to RTD customers along the US 36
corridor, and particularly at 36-Flatiron:
1) 1st Preferred Solution (Two Civic Center Routes) - Given the current popularity
of the existing HX route to Civic Center and RTD’s interest in maintaining appropriate
levels of service capacity and travel speeds, I would propose that the BJCC, like the
routes to Union Station, be divided into two separate routes. The modified BJCC would
follow the existing HX route with service to 36-Table Mesa, 36-McCaslin, and 36-Flatiron
to Civic Center. A new Broomfield-Westminster to Civic Center (BWCC) should be
created to service 36-Broomfield, 36-Church Ranch, and 36-Sheridan to Civic Center. I
believe the new BWCC line would, as the HX, be a popular and well-received addition
to US 36 service that could expand and/or improve ridership for those who need to
travel to work in the traditional government and business sections of downtown. And
importantly, this modification will result in no reduction in service for current HX riders
from any station. This proposed solution will also address likely capacity issues on the
BJCC route and certain RTD parking lots along the US 36 corridor.
2) 2nd Preferred Solution (Adding BJCC Stop at 36-Flatiron) - Adding an
additional bus stop to an already existing Park-N-Ride such as 36-Flatiron results in
minimal additional costs for RTD and a very slight delay in route service times. To the
contrary, the proposed Plan, if unmodified, imposes a significantly longer and more
inconvenient commute on approximately 1/5 of the HX passengers who currently board
at 36-Flatiron. As noted above, there is no economic or demographic justification for
imposing such hardships on a significant number of RTD’s US 36 customers. At a
minimum, RTD should add a US 36-Flatiron stop on the BJCC route at peak commuting
times (7-8am; 4:30-6pm). The RTD staff’s desire for simplicity of presentation of the
service levels is not a reasonable justification for imposing a longer and more
inconvenient commute on a large number of HX riders. People who ride the regional
commuter buses have not in the past and will not in the future have any difficulty
determining the appropriate commuting routes on US 36 even if a route has limited,
additional service stops during peak commuting hours. This is especially true given the
rise of public transit mobile phone apps and maps (like Google Maps) and availability of
real-time Internet tracking of buses.

2.13.C.d

3) 3rd Preferred Solution (Local Civic Center Service) - This option would convert
the BJCC to a local service to Civic Center with service to all stops on the US 36
corridor. This option is certainly preferable to no Civic Center service at 36-Flatiron. It
would provide one seat/no transfer service to Civic Center, which is much better for
passengers in bad weather conditions and for passengers with bicycles or luggage. It
would also address the potential parking capacity issues along US 36 noted above.
While this option would still constitute a degradation of existing HX service to 36-Flatiron
(and areas to the Northwest) by resulting in somewhat longer commute times for all
current HX riders, it is a significant improvement to the proposed Plan.
I thank the RTD Board and Staff for your time and consideration of my comments
and recommended improvements to the Plan. In particular, I hope that the RTD staff
concludes to maintain a Civic Center route to 36-Flatiron as part of the proposed
Flatirons Flyer BRT.

Dear Mr. Washington:
Effective, affordable and efficient transportation is a key infrastructure element for economic vitality in
the Northwest Denver Metro region.
The Boulder Chamber has recently been in conversation with our regional Chamber and Economic
Development colleagues about regional housing, transportation and jobs. It is clear that we share a
common interest in the regional transit that RTD delivers and plans to deliver.
As you gather input on the RTD Fare Study and the US 36 BRT Operations Plan, we wish to convey our
support for the position statement of the US 36 Mayors & Commissioners Coalition and 36 Commuting
Solutions. We also concur with the City of Boulder in their letter to you. In particular, we would like to
emphasize the following points:
•
•
•

US36 BRT service should maximize investment in transit oriented development and other
infrastructure improvements that communities have made along the corridor;
Fares for FasTracks related service should be priced the same across the system, regardless of
whether it is bus or rail-based;
It is unacceptable for our region to suffer reduced service and higher fares at the same time that
we are absorbing thwarted expectations for FasTracks rail investments.

Sincerely,

John L. Tayer
President & CEO
Boulder Chamber

To whom it may concern:
I am writing on behalf of the student body at CU Boulder. I am the Director of City and
Neighborhood Relations for CU Student Government Executive Staff. Matters such as the RTD
changes fall within my jurisdiction and recently, I have heard some concern for students who are
commuters, and those who live nearby. The proposed changes to the 36 corridor due to the new
Bus Rapid Transit line are going to hurt people. We have a large (and growing) population
comprised of students, faculty, and staff who are pushed to cities outside of Boulder because the
rent is so expensive in the areas that immediately surround campus. In addition, a little less than
half of our student population comes from out-of-state and relies heavily on the SkyRide service
to Denver International Airport when they want to visit their families over break. When I first
heard of the changes I was confused because the information about them that is readily available
does not really paint a picture of the multitude of effects they will have on the community. It was
not until something was posted in our CU-Boulder Today publication that I could really grasp
how these changes would impact students.
When I learned that the SkyRide service was going to stop at the Broomfield Park and
Ride I thought of those students who will have to make multiple bus changes with their heavy
suitcases, will have to pay more for park-and-ride accommodations, and/or will experience
significant delays while traveling to the airport. As we all know, catching a flight is time
sensitive and having to calculate how long it will take one to arrive is crucial.
The rates for certain bus lines will change and I am wondering how this will effect
student fees. The Environmental Center here at CU pays for bus passes and promotes public
transportation around Boulder, but with higher costs I am concerned how the University will
approach payment for RTD next year. The proposed changes eliminate one of the only bus routes
that takes students to East Campus. The students who work and attend class on East Campus are
typically graduate students doing research. This is exactly the population that is pushed out of
Boulder due to cost and to make it harder for them to reach their final destination does an
incredible amount of harm—especially for those who are required to be flexible to get to campus
in case something goes wrong with their research.
The Bus Rapid Transit sounds like a great service—it will benefit students and
community members alike. With the delay of the Light Rail it seems like a beneficial solution,

but I do not believe that CU students, faculty, and staff should suffer because of it. Perhaps RTD
can make more of an effort to take these populations into consideration and can do more
outreach and education in the community-at-large regarding the consequences of these changes.
Thank you for taking the time to consider the student opinion and I look forward to hearing from
you soon.

Introduction and Timeline
RTD recently released its proposed service plan for its FasTracks Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
system planned to open on US 36 in January 2016, announcing five public meetings to garner
public input in the corridor, along with an email address for input outside of the meetings. The
first public meeting was in Boulder on Monday March 16th; the last is at noon in Denver, April
13. Deadline for all comment is May 1; with the RTD board set to act on the plan May 21st.
The meeting schedule and additional information, including where you can email your
comments, can be found at http://www.rtd-denver.com/servicechanges-us36.shtml. If you do
provide your comments by email, include your RTD District Director as a recipient. To identify
your Director and find his or her email address, go to Look up Your Director.
RTD also released the results of its Fare Study. It is a plan to revise the structure of the entire
fare system prior to opening four new FasTracks corridors in 2016. At the same time, RTD
plans to implement an overall fare increase, the first since 2011. Fifteen public meetings will be
held throughout the entire Transportation District, one in each RTD Director’s electoral district,
starting March 23, wrapping up April 8, with final comments due by April 8. Boulder’s Fare
Study meeting is on April 6th at 6 PM at the Boulder Public Library. The meeting schedule and
additional information, including the opportunity to provide your comments online, can be found
at http://www.rtd-denver.com/fare-recommendation.shtml. In addition to submitting your
comments on line, you may send them by email to your RTD District Director. To identify your
Director and find his or her email address, go to Look up Your Director.
Background
The US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition (MCC) and 36 Commuting Solutions, of
which CU-Boulder is a member, have provided substantial feedback on the changes proposed
in the current RTD plan for US 36 BRT. RTD has made no changes based upon that feedback
and these groups feel that the proposed service levels fail to meet the needs of a growing
corridor.
Impact of RTD’s Plans on the University and Its Constituents
With the rollout of US 36 FasTracks BRT service in January, 2016, RTD plans to:
• Add no new peak-hour express service to campus along Broadway; it had been expected
that peak-hour express service would be improved with construction of the FasTracks US
36 BRT Express Lanes.
• Eliminate existing mid-day (9 a.mm to 3:30 p.m.) express service between Denver and
CU/Downtown Boulder.
• Eliminate the current S route that brings commuters north from Denver Union Station and
communities along US 36, directly to CU-Boulder’s East Campus along Arapahoe.
• Eliminate existing direct AB SkyRide service to DIA south of the Flatirons Park-n-Ride at
NW Parkway. CU affiliates living in Broomfield and Westminster will no longer have direct
service to DIA.

RTD dropped its plan to add express service to the growing CU-Boulder East Campus from
Table Mesa Park-n-Ride as the 209X. CU-Boulder had already planned $20K in bus stop
improvements at the new Sustainability Energy and Environment Complex, which was
planned to contribute to the project’s LEED Platinum rating.
Provide no US 36 corridor service to or from the new Boulder Junction Station (near 33rd &
Pearl) between 9 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. weekdays; no weekend or evening corridor service.
Provide no SkyRide service to DIA from the new Boulder Junction Station.
Provide no direct service between Boulder Junction and Denver Union Station.
The new RTD BRT vehicles have less bike-on-board capacity (going from 8 bikes to 6).
This will be felt most acutely during peak-hour service - local, express and regional – where
bike-on-bus capacity is frequently maxed-out.
“Express” BRT service would be priced at the higher “Regional” fare.

Goals CU-Boulder is supporting along with US 36 Commuting Solutions and the US 36
Mayors and Commissioners Coalition:
• Maximize US 36 BRT corridor investments; increase express service to meet the
anticipated increase in demand that will accompany the announcement of BRT.
• Retain current transit ridership and attract new ridership.
• Better serve growing transit markets on East Campus, in East Boulder and elsewhere
throughout the corridor.
• Design US 36 BRT service with enough capacity to ensure a high quality customer
experience on opening day.
• RTD operating investment for US 36 that is comparable to other FasTracks corridors.
• US 36 BRT is setting the precedent for BRT in our region. It is important that the service
and fares are implemented appropriately the first time as it will be the foundation to build
metro-wide support for future BRT services throughout the District.
What we are requesting RTD to do
Bring slightly more operations funding to the table; enough to:
• Eliminate all proposed service cuts, particularly the S route, mid-day Express Service
between Downtown Boulder and Denver Union Station and the AB SkyRide for Broomfield
and Westminster.
• Implement a modest (20%) opening day increase over current peak-hour regional Express
Service at Boulder Transit Center, serving CU-Boulder along Broadway.
• Provide mid-day service between Boulder Junction and Denver on 28th Street, on the east
side of CU-Boulder’s Main Campus.
• Provide AB SkyRide service between Boulder Junction and DIA.
• Provide service between Boulder Junction and Denver Union Station.
• Price “Express BRT” service with the “Express” fare level, rather than at the higher
“Regional” fare.
• Price all trips between the McCaslin Station and Table Mesa Station as local trips. The
same trip on the same vehicle is currently priced at three different fares.
• Commit to a cooperative effort with stakeholder involvement to improve the benefits and
minimize adverse impacts to the Eco Pass and College Pass programs related to changes
to the fare structure.

Desired outcomes
• For US 36 BRT to be in the position to welcome all existing and new riders who turn out for
the heavily marketed, long-awaited, highly visible new BRT service. We do not want to see
riders turned away because no new capacity is being provided to CU-Boulder on Broadway
in Boulder in the peak hour.
• To minimize the numbers who negatively experience the rollout of the US 36 BRT due to
service cuts, service reductions and increased inconvenience due to forced transfers.
• For US 36 BRT to be seen as an outstanding success. Two more BRT services are now
entering the planning stages: Diagonal HWY 119 between Longmont and Boulder; and
HWY 7 (on Arapahoe and Baseline) between Brighton and Boulder. Their success will be
linked to the success of RTD’s first BRT line on US 36.
Other Facts about CU-Boulder, FasTracks and US 36 BRT
• Approximately 8,500 CU-Boulder faculty, staff and students commute daily on some portion
of the US 36 BRT corridor; half of this number currently uses RTD at least one day a week.
There is a large potential for ridership growth among CU-Boulder -bound commuters
travelling the corridor daily, as all hold RTD transit passes and all must pay to park
anywhere on Campus.
• US 36 Corridor communities voted strongly in favor of the 2004 FasTracks $0.004/dollar
sales tax increase that has provided RTD 67% more sales tax revenue per dollar over the
last decade, amounting to an added $233 million for FasTracks through 2014.
• RTD puts the increased operating cost of their service plan for US 36 BRT at $900K to $1
million per year above what they currently spend operating existing service in the corridor.
This is only an approximate 10% increase over current service. Existing service is funded
out of the pre-FasTracks $0.006/dollar RTD sales tax.
• RTD collected $27.7 million from the NW area corridor communities (all of Boulder County
plus Broomfield and Westminster) in 2014 from the $0.004/dollar FasTracks tax alone and
plans to spend only $1 million per year in FasTracks funds to provide FasTracks operating
enhancements to existing service in the corridor.
• RTD’s annual FasTracks sales tax revenue from the corridor communities has grown by an
average of $1.3 Million per year over the last five years.
• In rolling out new services in five other FasTracks corridors, RTD has not attempted to hold
any other corridor so closely to the base operating budget of the pre-FasTracks services in
the corridor.
• RTD is revising its fare structure at the same time. Their plan would reduce fares on much
of RTD’s rail service while increasing fares on most of their bus services, leading to a
situation where bus passengers will subsidize rail passengers. This has ramifications
beyond a rider’s choice between rail and bus to get from point A to point B. There is no rail
service in the NW corridor, between Westminster, Boulder and Longmont, only bus service.
As proposed, with light rail fares declining in Denver and bus fares increasing in the NW
corridor, the new fare structure would introduce another dimension to the regional inequity
already seen for the NW corridor. The FasTracks NW Rail line between Westminster,
Boulder and Longmont, initially scheduled for completion in January 2015, is now delayed
at least thirty years, to 2045.

Please keep the Rout S. Critical for me and several other folks I work with.
I did not answer No. 5 above, because I am not sure what to do. If making the transfer is too difficult or
otherwise problematic, I may choose to drive into Boulder each day.
If I were going continue to use this route would strongly depend on how long the trip from Boulder
Junction at Depot Square to Flatirons and Central would take. How many bus options 206 bus options
per hour would be available- it would be awful if there was an accident on the 36 and there were limited
number of 206 buses and therefore I had to wait an excessive amount of time. The ride already takes
an hour and a half, more than double what it takes me to simply drive, so really this is only saving me
gas money, not any frustration or ease of commute. Also I am very frustrated by this because I
specifically picked where I lived in downtown Denver to be able to readily and easily be able to use this
specific bus.
The one seat ride is a key benefit. The transfer to 206 would be ok if there were equally improved
service - minimizing the transfer time. The 206 service in its current form would be grossly insufficient.
Please don't cancel this route.
I recently bought a home in Denver with the expectation that i could take a single bus from Union
Station to Flatirons Park. I don't mind a longer ride, as i can do more work on the bus, if it is single route
(no transfer). Please save the S route for future commuting.
The "S" route is extremely convenient because of where I can catch it near my home and because of
the drop-off location. With our erratic weather, I value the fact that I can get on the bus and not have to
get off until I am at my office building. Having to wait outside to transfer to another bus would be
inconvenient and probably make the commute longer. That would be very discouraging. I have coworkers that must ride the bus every day and this add additional stress to their day.

Please do not get rid of this bus. Not having a transfer is the main draw for utilizing RTD as transport to
work. This will result in many more cars on 36 commuting to work.
i have already asked for the S to stop and flatiron PNR on 36 so i do not have to transfer from the BV.
Eliminating the S is even more annoying. The 206F only runs a few times a day so we have to walk to
catch the 206 at night. I want to keep the S and increase the stops on 36. With the express lanes, trip
time will still decrease.
I bike to the bus, so at every transfer I would need to unload my bike and load it again on another bus.
It doesn't seem like much, but that in and of itself can be a pain. That is why the one-seat ride is so
appealing to me. I typically ride the 7:01 from Westminster PnR and the bus is always full. I also take
the 4:03 S from work and it is full as well, so I'm not sure why this bus would be taken away. Please do
not cancel this service, it is a huge benefit for me and my fellow employees that take it!
I work for Markit, the largest company in Flatirons park with 500+ employees.Many of our employees
count on this bus line.
Keep the S route as is!
I'm able to drive from my home in downtown Denver to my office in east Boulder in 45 minutes, and my
mode of transportation is ultra reliable. If shorter trip times were my goal I would drive. Currently on the
S route I have a single block of time that allows me to spend 60 minutes reading, napping, or working
on my laptop between union station and east boulder. I board the bus from union station where it's
covered and climate controlled, and I'm able to get a good seat on the bus. If transfers are introduced,
the 10 or 20 minutes of possibly reduced time does not offset the cost of having that commute time
broken into periods that are much less conducive to reading/working/napping, introducing the possibility
of needing to stand out in the cold/rain, knowing that the next bus I get on may not have any seats,
higher chance of losing items on the bus.... Transfer routes are less reliable than one-seat-rides,
especially on snowy days when the chances of a missed transfer is highest. The round trip time savings
would have to be very significant to make up for the increased overhead of a transfer. Unless we're
looking at taking a total 75 minute trip down to a total 30 minute trip, the unreliability that is introduced
doesn't feel worth it. If I have to take a 30 minute ride, wait 10 minutes for a transfer, and then take
another 20 minute ride, that 15 minute time savings (over a 75 minute one-seat-ride) isn't worth the
cost of losing reliability and uninterrupted blocks of time that can be used for other activities. If I have to
be actively engaged with that is happening throughout the entire trip, I'm likely to start driving. If there
were a system in place that allowed riders to track each of the buses in real time on google maps and
know if they missed a transfer or how far away the next bus is, the introduced risks would feel less
substantial. If there was a way to notify drivers that you intend to transfer from bus ABC to bus XYZ (so
bus XYZ wouldn't leave 30 seconds before bus ABC arrived) the introduced risks would feel less
substantial. If there were a way to know that bus XYZ has no seats left, the introduced risks would feel
less substantial. As it stands, having to do a transfer (especially on snowy days) is playing Russian
roulette. Ultimately reliability is the reason people like trains over buses. The schedule of trains is much
harder to interrupt than the schedule of buses.
My firm is one of the largest employers in Flatirons Park and we risk to lose 10-15% of our staff if the S
route is discontinued. Not only will it be a loss to the local economy, but it may have financial
ramifications for RTD as our firm may no longer participate in the Eco-pass program if these benefits
are discontinued to the employees.
I am a hiring manager at Markit On Demand. When we are interviewing candidates it is very beneficial
for us to highlight that we have a number of employees that live in Denver and a direct bus is available.
This helps open up our pool of possible candidates to the Denver Metro area.
In regards to question 5: if the BRT system in conjunction with a transfer on the 206 gets me from
Union Station to my stop at Central/Flatiron quicker than the Route S does now then I would support
that. Transfers are probably the biggest friction point for riders. I live 1.7 miles from Union Station but I
have to leave my apartment at 7:00 AM to catch the 7:30AM S bus. If transferring to the 206 adds
another 15-20 minutes or more to my ride time then I'll most likely stop using the RTD. If the BRT
coming up 36 is delayed, am I waiting 15-20 minutes for the next 206 or will you increase 206
frequency during peak hours? I also think having real-time data on bus locations would help alleviate
some of the stress of transfers.
It is because of the S bus that I started using RTD. I am not sure I would continue if the schedule
changed.

Many people are riding s please don't cancel it. I am coming from broomfield - 469 west state highway
7 broomfield 80023 where there is no Rtd available.
I ride the S at least 3 times per week (sometimes more) and I do so mainly because I get on one bus
and it takes me from the Westminster PnR right to my office at the corner of Central and Flatirons
Parkway. I have been riding this bus for several years and I love it just the way it is. Many, many people
at my company, Markit on Demand, ride the S on a daily basis and the proposed change will impact a
lot of people. I seriously doubt that I will continue to ride the bus if the S is no longer an option and I
have to make a transfer.
I just moved to Denver and work in Boulder. I was originally living in Boulder, but couldn't afford the
housing and saw a great opportunity to live in Denver to save money, and commute to Boulder for my
job. I only decided this move was feasible after finding out about the S bus service. This made it so
much easier for me to get to and from Denver and my work, which is right down the street from Fate
Brewing Company. I already ride my bike from my house, to Union Station, load it on the bus, and take
it into Boulder every day. If the S bus service is eliminated, it'll add another leg to my already very long
commute. I barely have enough time as it is to get to and from work, and still enjoy any time before or
after to exercise, etc. The bus is VERY busy every day I ride it - both to and from Denver. There's quite
a few people in my office who take it, and we really would be negatively impacted by removal of the S
line. I'm incredibly stressed thinking about my commute will be if it's removed. Please keep the S bus
as it is heavily used by the large amount of people who work in East Boulder who need a singular
commute vehicle to get to and from work. The more segments and transfers you add to a commute the
more difficult it become, and the less likely people will be to use it. I have a car that I don't use to go to
work now, but if I'm forced to transfer buses and increase my commute, I'll have to drive. Thank you for
your consideration.
o I've found the 206 connection to be unreliable at Table Mesa. 2. The 206 only comes every 1/2
hour, so if you miss the connection, the penalty is high. 3. What's with the 8am 206 that doesn't
come all the way to the tech center and stops at 55th & Arapahoe? 4. Connections always add
a degree of inefficiency that makes it more worthwhile to drive RTD can pretend that the travel
time is the same or faster with a connection. But that's assuming a tight connection time. If you
add in 10-15 minutes that you need to plan for so you're not late. It no longer makes sense.
Frequently the S bus is running 10-15 minutes late in the morning! Thanks!
This route is a must. There's too many employees that work in East Boulder to remove this route?
Transferring would be less reliable.
I love the S bus.
Best thing about taking S is that even when it snows we can take a ride because we don't have to
change bus in between to reach our office which makes a lots of difference and comforting during
winter. And don't forget the instances when some one has to give their cars for maintenance and still be
happy to take S straight to their office.There are tons of people who take this bus everyday because it
takes straight to the door steps of our offices. In the last 9mnths I have tried at least 6 different
schedules of S and was wondered how the seats are always filled with people.Believe it or not there
are at least 8people who takes this bus to my office everyday.
The schedule for the 206 to busses such as the B never really line up very well. Also the 206 that
doesn't go all the way to the flat irons park, and instead goes to the high school, isn't very well marked
and I've been on it only to be kicked off at the Dinner Theater. So better schedule match and markings
of alternative buses is needed.
I already have to take 2 buses to get to work because the S doesn't stop at Flatirons park-n-ride. I
prefer the S over the 206 bus because it drops me off closer to work, because it goes into the business
park. The 206F would be a good alternative to the S if only it had earlier routes, because it too comes
into the business park.
Route 206 runs every 30 minutes and due to service adjustments the 206F only services the Flatirons
Business Park a few times a day and after 9AM in the mornings (most people are already at work by
9AM!!!). The improvements along 36 only get riders into Boulder faster, we're still hindered by how
frequent local routes run. This is why the S is so important. Riders are guaranteed a consistent arrival
time (barring traffic delays). In the new plan, riders would be dependent on arriving to Boulder Junction
on time to make a transfer or risk a 29+ minute delay at the station. That's not only a variability in traffic
delays but an added variability depending on whether transfers are made or not. Route S already takes
35+ minutes in the mornings from Broomfield PnR. Compare this to 20+ minutes by car. If the proposed

changes go forward, riders from Broomfield will see travel times increase and as a result more riders,
myself included, will forgo public transit.
It's kinds of surprise me when I first found the route S and could not imagine we can have a such
convenient route which can directly drive me from workplace to Denver. It is really a super convenient
route for all the workers who have been working in Flatirons Parks Area, not only for the people who
are living in Denver, but also for the people who might want to spend a weekend in Denver or need go
to Westminster/other stops between Denver and Boulder after their work.
I could actually go either way on Question 5. If transferring to the 206 would get me to work in around
the same amount of time that taking the S does now, then I would continue to use public transit to get
to work. If it is longer, or if I have to spend a long time waiting for the 206 after getting off the bus that I
would be taking to Boulder instead of the S, then I would not. I'm erring on the side of "Yes" because
using public transit is important to me.
The S bus route is essential to my daily commute. I love that I do not have to transfer and that the S
bus provides a direct ride from Union Station. I think RTD has done an amazing job encouraging
regional commuters to use public transportation as their primary mode of transportation. Please do not
discourage the use of RTD regional bus lines by forcing commuters to transfer. Transferring is
especially difficult since we do not have access to real time bus location data.
The 206 is the least dependable bus ever. I could ride the BV to the 206 but the 206 is pretty
consistently awful.. Riding the S, especially on snowy days makes my life very easy as I don't have to
worry about how late a bus will be to work. Just get on and there it is.
While I understand that I can transfer to the 206 from one of the other regional buses and still get to the
part of town where I work, I've always found transferring incredibly unreliable, especially in the case of
bad weather. I need to be consistent about when I arrive at work and transferring makes that nearly
impossible. Too many times have a bus arrived too late to catch a transfer, no matter how many
promises RTD has made to improve reliability.
There may not be that many S routes throughout the day, but there are certainly those who depend on
it to get to work. Getting rid of the route is like saying that the Flatirons Business Park is not important.
The S line is important to many employees at our company and needs to stay!
Do not stop S route
Yes, I WOULD keep using transit, but I believe that extra step will make my mornings and evenings
more complicated than it needs to be. The S Bus is really nice because it allows me a direct trip to
Boulder without taking extra time to transfer.
The S Route is the perfect bus for me, when my car isn't working or when I don't feel safe driving. It is
indespensible.
I would prefer a shorter trip and it would be great if the bus did not go through the 28th street and
instead just took Foothills up to north east Boulder which is where most of the business circle is.
Thanks
Please keep this route as is!
This is very upsetting that this route could potentially change because with inclement weather, it makes
bus transfers very difficult during the wintertime.
There needs to be a route to Flatirons park from Gunbarrel...the normal 205 route makes it quite a long
bus ride to get to a place that's only 10 minutes away.
The best part about the S bus is that it takes LESS time than going to DT Boulder and it drops me off
outside work without me having to stress out about a whole bunch of transfers!
The extra time to switch between buses means I will have to leave home over 20-30 minutes earlier
each day and then get home 20-30 minutes later each day. I would just start driving to save myself that
lost time.

2.13.C.d

I have now previously written to the RTD concerning the services changes on the Northwest US
36 corridor twice (this letter, the same, being my third addressed to the RTD) and have yet to see
any meaningful change which would enhance mine, or anyone else’s, public transportation
experience using the RTD’s taxpayer funded services. I, along with nearly all other commuters
in the Northwest corridor, are being completely and as disrespectfully as possible ignored by the
RTD and its board of amateur politicians (most of whom I assume have ambitions of someday
running for state senate). No effort have been made by the recently appointed interim General
Manager to reverse the damage caused by his predecessor which has caused the FasTracks
project to be 30 years behind schedule. Instead of building the commuter rail line which was
approved by taxpayers back in 2004, the taxpayers of the Northwest corridor have instead been
forced to subsidize RTD patronage in other (more wealthy) parts of the Denver metropolitan
area. There has also been the added distraction of the endless construction project that is US36
which will result, not in a commuter rail line, but in a new express bus route, which is simply a
rebranding of the previous system. The previous General Manager, Mr. Washington, in his oped in the Denver Post, shamefully claimed that the new express bus service (“BRT or whatever it
actually is”) was not instead of the rail line, but “in addition” to the rail line which the taxpayers
have already paid for. Despite, this blatant misrepresentation of the facts, the RTD has not even
begun construction on the promised and paid for Northwest Rail Line and instead a replacement
express bus service has been forced on to the taxpayers. I honestly would not mind it if a True
bus rapid transit system was built as a supplement to the commuter rail line, but this new express
bus service doesn’t even come to close to an actual bus rapid transit system. Based on the IDTP
(Institute for Transportation and Development Policy) BRT Standard, for a system to be defined
as BRT it must 1) have a dedicated bus-way, which is ideally aligned in the center of the road, 2)
have dedicate right of way through the use of delineators, bollards, or colorized pavement, 3) offboard fare collection, either through a barrier controlled system or by a proof-of-payment
system, 4) and platform level boarding, which would reduce boarding and alighting times. The
US 36 BRT (or whatever it actually is) has literally none of the defining features of an actual bus
rapid transit system. There is(are) no dedicated bus-only lane(s) which are center aligned;
instead there is a toll lane, which will be shared by motorists. The new buses will not have
dedicated right of way and will be forced to share the road with other vehicles. There will not be

Attachment: Attch D Summary of Petitions and Letters US 36 (2412 : US 36 BRT Service Plan - January 2016)

To Whom It May Concern:

Packet Pg. 113

33

any off-board fare collection system, such as fare-gates or off-board conductors. There will be
no platform-level boarding, but instead the buses will remain exactly as they already are. The
IDTP has already come out requesting that the RTD stop referring to the new express bus service
on US 36 as “BRT” as it most obviously is not anything even approaching an actual bus rapid
transit system (http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27392678/u-s-36-bus-transit-plan-is-not). It
would be wise of the new General Manager to stop referring to the new express bus routes as
“BRT”.
Concerning the new fares for the new enhanced express bus routes: I recently read that the fare
for the journey between Union Station and Westminster Center would be considered a “local”
fare and would cost less than the journey from Union Station to any of the other stops along the
US 36 corridor; I would go further and demand that the fare for the entirety of this new express
bus route be completely free for all passengers, until, and only if, the Northwest Rail Line is
actually completed all the way to Longmont as was approved by and paid for by taxpayers in
2004. The money intended for the construction of the Northwest Rail Line has already been
diverted to both the new express bus service and other RTD projects in the more wealthy parts of
the metro area. There is no reason for anyone to any fares for this new bus service, until they
have the option to choose between rail and bus.
Also concerning the new fare system: I find it weird that SMART cards (which should be their
name; there should be no difference between college passes and eco passes) should not be
available to anyone and everyone who wants one. Paying with coins and paper money while
boarding (and or alighting #facepalm) slows down to whole process immensely. It takes half a
second to scan a card at a fare-gate outside of the bus even before boarding, while it can take
several minutes, sometimes, to fumble with coins and cash and for the driver to determine the
proper fare and whether or not the passenger wanted or even needed a transfer. It’s the 21st
century, not the 1950s.
Concerning “stay right” signs on escalators: what is the harm in putting up
“stay right” signs on the escalators at Union Station? Staying on the right
side of an escalator is basic etiquette which many, if not most, people in
Denver are completely unaware of.
(http://www.examiner.com/article/escalator-etiquette) The people of
Denver are so poorly educated about public transportation that a harmless
little sign with the words “stay right” can do nothing but good things.
In your last letter to me, I received no response concerning my suggestion that waiting areas at
the Union State bus terminal be more explicitly defined, as to avoid confusion, especially during
busy times. Nor did I receive any response concerning the existence of turnstiles at the Sports
Authority at Mile High light rail station, but the notable lack of turnstiles at any other light rail
station.

All this being said, I would be perfectly fine with leaving things the exactly the way they
currently are if the buses actually showed up on time, every time. There is absolutely no excuse
for any bus or train to ever arrive or depart at any other times than the scheduled times. There is
no excuse for buses arriving early, nor is there an excuse for busses arriving late. I am a regular
rider on the BV and BF routes, as previously stated, and routinely experience late busses. The
eastbound BV is supposed to depart from the Church Ranch stop precisely at 11:33, not at 11:38
nor at 11:45 nor at 12:00 nor at any other time other than 11:33.
In conclusion, I would once again like to voice my support for Districts J, O and I leaving the
RTD as to more respectfully accommodate the taxpayers of those areas. There is no reason to
keep paying for a train that will never be built.
I, obviously, do not expect any changes to come about as a result of mine (and thousands of
other’s) complaints concerning the absolute lack of respect which has been given the residents of
the North West Corridor, but I hope that at least someone recognizes the extreme discontent
concerning RTD and their shameful lack of services.

Better Boulder Comments on US 36 BRT Service Plan
While we recognize and appreciate the hard work that RTD staff have engaged in to
develop the draft US 36 BRT service plan, and appreciate many elements of the plan,
we believe that additional service is needed in order to make best use of the new
managed lanes on US 36 and adequately serve the transit oriented development at
Boulder Junction.
The context:

US36 BRT needs to get started off on the right foot. This service both needs to be
successful, and needs to be perceived as successful by the public, elected officials,
and key private sector stakeholders. This is important to RTD and the region as a
whole, for several reasons:

Since NW Rail will not be delivered to the NW area, at least not in any short to
medium time frame, US 36 BRT is the only Fastracks service which will directly
serve most NW area communities. Having a very positive rollout of BRT and broad
stakeholder support will be important to public understanding that the NW area is
getting a high quality transit service. If, instead, the rollout of BRT is marred by
complaints about too low a level of service, this will only feed perceptions of
regional inequity.

BRT is important to RTD’s future. There are already two additional BRT lines in the
adopted fiscally constrained2040 RTP (SH 119 and Colfax), other lines identified in
the NAMs study, the SH 7 BRT study is moving forward, and RTD will be receiving
DRCOG funds for a regional BRT study. But public understanding of BRT is very low.
Just as it was critical for RTD to do a great job developing the first light rail line two
decades ago, to show people what light rail could mean in the Denver region, it is
similarly critical that RTD to a great job developing the first BRT line. The goal
should be for stakeholders, users, and the general public to love BRT the way people
embraced LRT. It is worth spending a little more money to achieve this.

For Boulder, it is important both to maintain great service along the Broadway
corridor and to significantly improve service to the Boulder Junction area. Boulder
has planned major transit oriented housing and employment growth in this area.

Packet Pg. 116

36

RTD is a partner in Depot Square, Boulder Junction has already begun to develop,
with the addition of the Depot Square apartments, Solana Apartments, Hyatt Place
Hotel and Nickel Flat apartments. A new Google campus with up to 1,500
employees has been approved, and plans are moving forward for hundreds of
thousands of square feet of additional mixed-use developments within a half mile
radius.
Specific Suggestions:

Maintaining great service on Broadway:
While the proposed service plan does add significant all stop service, it cuts back on
express service during some peak hours, and eliminates mid day express service.
This is problematic, and does not make appropriate use of the new managed lanes,
as the all stop service would not use the managed lane. We recommend two
changes:

1) Peak period. The proposed service plan is pretty good for peak period service
between BTC and DUS, with the exception of the 7-8AM eastbound and 5-6
PM westbound periods. During these 2 hours, there is a significant reduction
in express service compared to today, from 8-9 per hour down to 6 per hour.
We would recommend that the existing frequency be maintained during
those hours.
2) Mid-day- the proposed service plan drops the existing once an hour mid-day
express service, while increasing local service from 2 to 4 trips per hour. We
recommend expanding mid-day express service.

Boulder Junction Service:
While the proposed service plan does improve on peak service by making it
bidirectional, it is important that there be some direct service between Boulder
Junction and Union Station, and some mid day and evening service. It is true that
this is a developing area, and does not yet have the densities it will in a few years,
but there has already been significant development at Boulder Junction, in addition
to significant existing housing and employment within a slightly larger radius. We
recommend modest service enhancements, combined with a commitment to
increase service as the area builds out and demand grows.
We recommend:

1) Alternate runs to Union Station and Civic Center during the peak.
2) Add low frequency mid-day and evening service, and some weekend service
-once or twice an hour service mid-day and 6-10 PM on weekdays and hourly
service on weekends.
3) Commit to regularly revisiting service levels in Boulder Junction, including
DIA service, as development proceeds and demand grows. This is consistent
with the 2012 memo from RTD to the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners

which shows minimum service levels increasing over time after opening day,
towards the 2035 levels anticipated in the EIS.
4) Retain direct service to the major employment centers in east Boulder,
similar to the current route S service.

With these changes we believe that we could get to a point where key stakeholders
can come together to focus on working together to make the rollout a success,
rather than arguing about the service plan.

COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND IMPACTS
Economic: The Depot Square project will promote a diverse and sustainable economy by
housing a 150-room hotel; RTD bus transit station; shared parking structure; 71 affordable
residential units; the renovated and reused Boulder Jaycees Depot; and transportation
infrastructure to support the new development with an emphasis on pedestrian, bike and
transit facilities.
Environmental: Along with new transportation infrastructure, an aggressive travel demand
management plan has been required. All new construction must also meet the City of
Boulder’s energy code requirements.
Social: The 71 new residential units within the Depot Square project will provide affordable
housing. The transit-oriented development promotes ease of mobility for a broad range of
people.
BACKGROUND
The Depot Square development includes a mix of transit, permanently affordable housing, hotel
and commercial activities, and a civic plaza south of the Boulder Jaycees Depot. The integrated,
mixed-use development has a number of common facilities that will serve all users of the site,
such as a plaza and public parking garage. This development is located north of Pearl Parkway,
between 30th Street and the BNSF Railroad, and east of the new Junction Place right of way.
Attachment A provides a vicinity map of the project.
In 2001, Boulder Junction began as a City Council initiative to partner with RTD to acquire a
transit anchor in the Boulder Valley Regional Center, years prior to the passage of RTD’s
FasTracks program. A site selection study in 2001 identified the 11.24-acre Pollard Friendly
Motor Company property at 30th Street and Pearl Parkway as the preferred location for the transit
facility and council directed staff to negotiate the purchase. In 2004, council approved the
purchase of the site using housing and transportation funds. This purchase came with the
expressed purpose of designing and constructing a “transit-oriented development” that would be
located near high-frequency transit service and provide a mix of housing types, including a
“significant level” of affordable housing. Of the approximately eight acres of land originally
purchased by the city, 5.5 acres were leased to Pollard Friendly Motor Company until October
2014. RTD purchased the remaining 3.2 acres of the site.
On Nov. 8, 2011, council approved a motion granting the city manager authority to enter into a
development agreement and lease for the city-owned Boulder Jaycees Depot, and the
conveyance of property into the proposed condominium association at Depot Square. On Feb.
21, 2012, council received an update on the Boulder Junction Phase I Implementation Plan and
the city’s proposed financing mechanisms for the Boulder Junction Access General Improvement
District’s portion of the parking garage and the affordable housing at Depot Square. On April 17,
2012, council approved a motion granting the city manager authority to approve and execute a
cooperation agreement with the Boulder Junction Access General Improvement District-Parking
(BJAD-P). Also on April 17, 2012, council approved a motion to authorize the city manager as
ex officio general manager of the BJAD-P to approve and execute all documents necessary to
purchase 100 parking spaces in the parking structure.

2.13.C.d

Depot Square will be a mixed-use project that includes a full-service underground RTD bus
facility, a 71-unit affordable housing project, a hotel, structured public parking for the Boulder
Junction Access General Improvement District, and accessory parking for the housing, RTD,
hotel, and Boulder Jaycees Depot uses. Since the Planning Board approved this project in
October 2011, the various development entities have continued to work together to get the
project under construction. There were a great number of agreements necessary to create the
public-private partnership for the Depot Square development.
A series of closings for the project was completed on July 26, 2013. The public parties included
the City of Boulder, RTD and the Boulder Junction Access General Improvement District. The
private parties include Pedersen Development; 3001 Pearl, LLC; Hyatt Hotels; Adolfson and
Peterson Construction; and Great Western Bank. There were 40 documents executed for these
closings, including deeds, covenants, declarations and loan documents. The closing documents
included some of the highlights listed below.
The city finalized the subdivision plat and agreement approval for the Depot Square
development. This reconfigured the three lots on the property, included the dedication and
construction of Junction Place, and defined developer contributions towards key public
improvements and other projects. Additionally, a number of easements were either released
or granted that were necessary to prepare the site for development.
In addition to the city subdivision process, the portion of the property east of Junction Place
was further subdivided through the use of a Colorado common interest community, often
referred to as a condominium. RTD and the city sold land to the developer, who placed it into
the common interest community. The condominium includes units for the bus facility, hotel,
affordable housing, parking, and the Boulder Jaycees Depot. Each of the units includes
parking units that will be built in the parking garage and wrapped by the affordable housing.
The common interest community declaration and map were executed to provide legal
descriptions for the units and how the various units will be operated together. The
declaration, together with the Depot Square Owners Association Bylaws deal, established the
relationship among the unit owners in terms of operation and maintenance of the various
units and the common areas.
Immediately upon creation of the condominium units, the RTD Unit bus facility and
associated parking was conveyed to RTD, the Depot Unit and associated parking was
conveyed to the city, and the BJAD-P Parking Unit was conveyed to the city for BJAD-P.
As a result of those conveyances, RTD, the city and BJAD-P are part of the Depot Square
Owners Association.
The unit owners Association also needed to be created. The Depot Square Owners
Association is a nonprofit corporation that is responsible for taking care of the common
elements. It also includes the governance requirements for how decisions are made with
regard to the common interest community including the plaza area. Members of the board
include representatives of the unit owners. The association documents define rules related to

2.13.C.d

There is a parking purchase agreement and associated loan documents, the Boulder Junction
Access General Improvement District agreed to purchase a parking unit within the parking
garage over time. Also, to guarantee this arrangement, there is a cooperation agreement
between the city and the general improvement district where the city agrees to make up the
difference between revenues and purchase obligations, to be repaid by the general
improvement district in later years as revenues increase and stabilize.
A parking management agreement for Depot Square describes how the parking garage will
be jointly used by the various unit owners. It follows a set of principles establishing that, to
the maximum extent possible, all parking should be shared, unbundled and managed (feebased). The owners association will determine the entity that will be primarily responsible for
operating and maintaining the garage. The intent of the agreement is to create a seamless
parking management system that will serve the needs of the public and all of the unit owners.
Public paid parking will be offered by BJAD-P for the spaces it owns, as well as any other
spaces that other unit owners determine to pool for public parking.
A document memorializing the amendment to the Pollard Friendly Motor Company lease
was finalized in early February 2013 and later recorded. Due to Pollard Friendly Motor
Company's cooperation, a significant amount of land was released from the Pollard Friendly
Motor Company leasehold area (originally 5.5 acres, amended to 4.3 acres) that will allow
some of the redevelopment efforts associated with the Depot Square development and several
key public improvements (the Pearl Parkway multiway boulevard, Junction Place bridge at
Goose Creek, and pocket park grading/path) to occur early and concurrent with the
development of the east side of the property.
Part of the redevelopment effort is to put the Boulder Jaycees Depot to a beneficial use.
There is an agreement with Pedersen Development to rehabilitate the Boulder Jaycees Depot
building in exchange for the ability to sublet the building to an operator such as a restaurant.
The City of Boulder has already approved the alteration certificate for the renovations and
the work is expected to be completed in compliance with all city historic preservation
guidelines.
There are also numerous documents related to the creation of permanently affordable rental
housing on the property. The city has pledged $5.4 million of affordable housing funds to be
used to construct 71 permanently affordable units on the property. In order to implement that
objective, the city entered into an affordable housing agreement with 3001 Pearl, LLC, the
developer, and provided the permanent affordability housing covenant recorded at closing.
There are also a number of financial agreements such as a promissory note and deed of trust.
At the closing, the city paid the developer the first payment of the $5.4 million for
predevelopment activities associated with the affordable housing portion of the project.
Progress payments will be made during the course of construction of the affordable housing
portion of the development.

Finally, there are a number of deeds and instruments associated with ensuring that all of the
associated land transactions have been completed.

Depot Square Construction Status
Adolfson and Peterson Construction is under contract to construct the RTD bus facility, the
parking garage, multifamily housing, and site improvements, including Junction Place. A rightof-way and grading permit was issued for this project in late July 2013. Construction of the
dewatering system at the RTD bus facility began on Aug. 5, 2013, and excavation for the bus
facility and site grading started on Aug. 26, 2013. Exporting excavated materials will continue
into early November 2013, and foundation construction is anticipated to immediately follow
once the bus facility building permit is issued. Utility, site work, and above-ground structure
work will proceed starting in approximately May 2014, following completion of the below-grade
portions of the bus facility. Other building permits for the Depot Square project are in the final
stages of the review process.
As part of the Depot Square project, a Hyatt Place hotel is being constructed by Milender White
Construction Company. Foundation work for the hotel is anticipated to begin in early November
2013.
During the September 2013 flooding, the excavation that had been initiated for the construction
of the bus box filled with floodwaters. Combined with elevated groundwater levels and related
dewatering system issues, this caused a three week delay in construction activity. The entire
Depot Square project has an anticipated completion date of early 2015.
Pollard Lease
When the city purchased the Pollard Friendly Motor Company property on the northeast corner
of 30th Street and Pearl Parkway in October 2004, the city leased a portion of the property back
to Pollard Friendly Motor Company through Oct. 30, 2014. The term may be extended for two
years in the event that Pollard Friendly Motor Company decides to exercise an option to
purchase a 6.6-acre parcel of land attached to the Municipal Service Center (often called the
Yards) that has frontage on Pearl Parkway. The city has contractual obligations to have the
Pollard Friendly Motor Company property prepared for development by the end of the 10-year
leasehold period.
The lease agreement between the city and Pollard Friendly Motor Company was amended in
February 2013. It reduced the size of the Pollard Friendly Motor Company leasehold area from
5.5 acres to 4.3 acres to allow for the construction of Junction Place and several key public
improvements, including the Pearl Parkway multiway boulevard, the Junction Place bridge at
Goose Creek, and rough grading and path improvements in the future pocket park. It also
formalized boundaries for some previous work that had been completed to construct a path ramp
from the sidewalk on 30th Street down to the Goose Creek bike path.

Street and Pearl Parkway property and option agreement to purchase the 6.6-acre parcel of land
at the city Yards. During the next year, staff expects to work collaboratively with Pollard
Friendly Motor Company as it prepares the Yards parcel for sale, as contemplated in the
agreements that were entered into as part of the purchase of the Pollard Friendly Motor Company
property at 30th Street and Pearl Parkway. Staff will provide future updates to council as these
discussions continue to explore options for the future use and development (or sale) of the cityowned site.
Access General Improvement Districts – Parking and Travel Demand Management (TDM)
To realize the goals of the Transit Village Area Plan and create a transit-oriented development,
two general improvement taxing districts were created in 2010: a parking district and a travel
demand management (TDM) district. They were named the Boulder Junction Access General
Improvement District-Parking (BJAD-P) and Boulder Junction Access General Improvement
District-TDM (BJAD-TDM). Currently, there are two major projects under construction in the
districts, a multi-building apartment complex at 3100 Pearl and the Depot Square project. 3100
Pearl is a 319-unit rental project developed by MKS Residential, LLC and built by its
construction company, Reylenn Construction Inc.
At the beginning of 2014, the BJAD-TDM will be issuing Eco Passes and subsidized bike- and
car-share memberships to residents of 3100 Pearl. A payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) agreement
defines how the owners of the properties will pay for the initial TDM programs prior to the tax
collection, and the first payment is due as a condition of the city’s issuance of a certificate of
occupancy. The Depot Square project is scheduled for completion in early 2015, including a
parking garage that is a public-private partnership between the developer, RTD, the city and
BJAD-P.
Key Public Improvements
There are a number of key public improvements under construction, or soon to be under
construction, in the Boulder Junction area. The status of the projects is listed below.
South Side of the Pearl Parkway Multiway Boulevard (30th Street to BNSF Railroad) –
This 2011 Capital Improvement Bond-funded project is constructing the multimodal
streetscape improvements on the south side of Pearl Parkway from 30th Street to the
Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad. Improvements between 30th Street and
Junction Place were completed and opened to the public on Oct. 28, 2013.
Construction on the south side of the Pearl Parkway multiway boulevard was minimally
affected by the September 2013 flooding. The precipitation forced a temporary work
shutdown between Sept. 9 and 15.

The new traffic signal at Pearl Parkway and Junction Place is complete and anticipated to be
operational in mid-to-late November 2013, in conjunction with tenant occupation of the
western building of the 3100 Pearl apartments. Improvements between Junction Place and
the railroad tracks will be completed by the spring of 2014 to coordinate with the completion
of the remaining portions of the private development at 3100 Pearl.

Junction Place Bridge at Goose Creek – This bond-funded project will construct a new
bridge linking Junction Place on the north and south sides of Goose Creek, as well as
complete area path connections to the Goose Creek path. Construction is expected to begin in
early November 2013 and be completed in the fall of 2014.
North Side of the Pearl Parkway Multiway Boulevard and Multi-use Path Project (30th
Street to Foothills Parkway) - This federal grant-funded project will complete the north half
of the multiway boulevard from 30th Street to the BNSF railroad and a multi-use path from
the railroad to Foothills Parkway. Extensive waterline, sanitary sewer and major drainageway
improvements are included in the project, including some to facilitate the development of
Depot Square and future Boulder Junction redevelopments. Construction is expected to begin
in mid-to-late November 2013 and be completed in the fall of 2014. Work over late fall and
winter 2013 will focus on utility and major drainageway box culvert construction.
US 36 Managed Lane/Bikeway Project – A design-build project under the oversight of the
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) is underway and scheduled to be completed
in two phases. This Eisenhower-era highway overhaul is reconstructing aging bridges and
pavement, improving safety, and adding one managed lane in each direction, as well as a
bikeway. Phase 1 (Pecos to 88th streets) is under construction and scheduled for completion
by the end of 2014. Phase 2 (88th Street to Table Mesa Drive) will go to financial close with a
private concessionaire and construction is scheduled for completion by the end of 2015. The
highest-priority use of the managed lane is Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which will have two
end-of-line stations in Boulder, one at Depot Square and the other at the Boulder Transit
Center at 14th and Walnut streets. BRT service is scheduled to begin in January 2016.
Other Private Development Activity
There are several other properties within Boulder Junction that are in various stages of the
planning review and development process. The properties are primarily located within the mixed
use (MU-4) and high-density residential (RH-6) zoning districts.
The construction at 3100 Pearl is well underway and completion of the 319-unit apartment
complex in four separate buildings is scheduled for a phased completion, starting in fall 2013 and
continuing through early summer 2014. Located directly across Pearl Parkway from Depot
Square, the property will primarily be residential, with ground floor retail and a fitness facility.
The 5.12-acre site also has below-grade parking and on-site recreational amenities. The project is
completing the first section of the new street, Junction Place, south of Pearl Parkway and also
fronts onto the Pearl Parkway multiway boulevard. The buildings are designed to address the
street with front door access to the units, intended to activate the streetscape and help establish a
pedestrian orientation for the area.
North and west of the proposed Junction Place bridge at Goose Creek, along the northern
planned extension of Junction Place, is a small urban-style apartment building (known as The
Lofts at Boulder Junction) developed by Coburn Development that has received final site review
approval. Proposed as a three-story, 22,850 square-foot building with 16 attached apartment
units and tuck-under parking at the rear of the site, the building is designed to have front doors
that face the street in a zero lot line configuration to help activate this portion of Junction Place.

A property located at 3085 Bluff St., west of the former Sutherlands Lumber property and north
of the Steel Yards, completed concept plan review in January 2013 for a 100 percent
permanently affordable residential project. An application for site review has not yet been
received and the developer, Element Properties, is working to assemble financing.
Representatives for the former Sutherlands Lumber property, located at 3390 Valmont Rd. and
within the mixed use (MU-4) zoning district, have submitted a pre-application and discussed
possible redevelopment of that property with a concept plan application submittal forthcoming.
City-owned Site at 30th Street and Pearl Parkway
The city continues to own 5.45 acres total at 30th Street and Pearl Parkway and leases 4.3 acres
of the property to Pollard Friendly Motor Company as described above. The 1.15-acre difference
is a result of the:
Existing multi-use path access ramp from 30th Street to the Goose Creek path;
Proposed pocket park, and related improvements; and
Junction Place easements.
During the July 31, 2012 study session discussions of the Update on Boulder Junction and the
city-owned site at 30th and Pearl streets, City Council indicated an interest in reevaluating the
potential uses of the site in light of the city’s goals for Boulder Junction and the realization of
nearby development projects. Staff will propose a planning process for the site once the timing of
its availability for development is more concrete.
NEXT STEPS
Staff will continue to provide necessary updates to City Council in 2014 and beyond.

Delivery of these vehicles is expected to be spread over the next 3 years. Equipment being funded by
this transaction includes major spare components for the buses and light rail vehicles listed above.

The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
certificates, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary
official statement, continuing disclosure agreement, certificate purchase agreement and the Resolution

2.13.D

for issuance of the certificates. The CFO has also hosted meetings with Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s
and Fitch to start the process of obtaining a credit rating for the certificates. The Board is being
requested, through the Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the parameters and to approve
agreements required in connection with the issuance of the certificates.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Certificate Resolution including the Indenture, Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, Preliminary Official Statement and Certificate Purchase Agreement are available
for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and Butler
Snow as Bond Counsel in regard to the Certificates. The Certificates will be underwritten by a team
including Wells Fargo(50%), Stifel Nicolaus(22%), Bank of America, Merrill Lynch(10%), US
Bancorp(10%) and Harvestons Securities(8%).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the financing are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES
Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2015,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Certificates of Participation, Series 2015A. This is
the recommended action.
Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2015,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Certificates of Participation, Series 2015A. This is
not the recommended action as it would not provide funding for the vehicle acquisitions previously
anticipated by the District.

Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Lease, the Indenture or the 2015A Certificates shall be construed as creating or constituting a
general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or
requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year.
The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the 2015A Certificates
except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in the Lease) and certain
other payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in
accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2015A Certificates shall
constitute a mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond
the then current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness
or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any
constitutional or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or
indirect District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the
2015A Certificates shall be construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of
governmental powers nor as a donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the
meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the
2015A Certificates shall directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond
those budgeted and appropriated for the District’s then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2015A Leased Property and do
not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to
renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2015A Leased Property pursuant to the
Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has
an option to purchase the 2015A Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease)
does not exceed the useful life of the 2015A Leased Property.
Section 9.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2015A Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2015A Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.
Section 10.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are

Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or
provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the 2015A Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the 2015A Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.

Authorization to Amend Contract with
NewPush for Expansion of Smart Media
Technology Hosting Service

CFO/AGM,

Finance

&

Board Meeting Date: July 28, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to amend the contract with NewPush to expand
Smart Media Technology (SMT) hosting services to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by an
additional $1,440,000 to a total contract value of $1,729,500 and extend the period of performance for
the current and additional services for three additional optional years. The additional services are needed
for SMT stored value system security and high availability. Of the $1,440,000 contract value, the
Board of Directors approved $500,000 for these hosting services in March 2015 along with other SMT
items. The remaining $940,000 equates to $333,333 per year for the remaining three years of the
contract that will be funded in the 2016-2021 operating budget.
BACKGROUND
As the SMT program services expand and to offer Stored Value functionality to its riders, a considerable
set of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure is required to be deployed and operational. To provide
what is equivalent to a debit card banking program, this necessitates a highly complex Data Center with
special attention to security, high-availability, communications, continuation of operations / disaster
recovery, etc. As example, the proposed architecture with NewPush includes twenty-one physical and
virtual servers in test and production environments and nine-databases. RTD and Xerox have been
working in concert to clearly define the physical and logical architecture, and other components
necessary for the Stored Value deployment and January 1, 2016 go-live. In parallel with many
competing demands, the provisioning evaluations and actions for hosting have been underway since the
fall of 2014.

More specifically the hosting, systems and subsystems must:
1. Meet Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards.
2. Provide protected high network security standards because of stored customer information.
3. Provide high availability because if the system were to be down, it would be a major
inconvenience for riders and there would likely be a loss of revenue.
4. Operate with appropriate levels of security, encryption and availability by November 1, 2015 to
be ready for the January 1, 2016 Go-Live launch for Stored Value.

Packet Pg. 147

2.13.E

DISCUSSION
Three options were considered to provide the necessary technology infrastructure to advance SMT to
offer Stored Value to RTD’s riders. These options included:
1. RTD host at its datacenter
2. Xerox to provide the hosting
3. Current third-party hosting provider (NewPush)
RTD Hosting
Pro:

RTD would have complete control over all aspects of the hosting.
Con:




The current data center has significant power and cooling constraints that prohibit
additional infrastructure.
RTD’s current system will not pass a PCI compliance audit. So, without significant
investment in infrastructure and staff, off-site hosting is necessary.
RTD’s current availability and staffing will not support the desired level of operations.
Providing a system that would meet the needs would be significantly more expensive than
contracting the services to a third party.

Xerox Hosting
Pro:
 Contractually, Xerox was to have hosted the current system.
 Xerox has a series of datacenters offering the necessary services and infrastructure at the service
levels required for stored value.
 The SMT / Stored Value are Xerox proprietary systems. If they hosted, it would eliminate the
potential of operational conflicts or misunderstandings.
Con:
 The hosting called-out in the 2010 contract does not have the desired level of service to provide
the security and availability needed for the system.
 Xerox is likely to be an expensive solution and exceed funds currently budgeted.
 The current contract has federal requirements and it would be difficult to expand the current
contract to include the desired additional services into the future.
 We have worked with Xerox for months on planning the hosting services and do not have a clear
path forward with them.
Third-Party Hosting by NewPush
Pro:
 NewPush currently hosts SMT websites and banking servers under an existing contract that is
proposed for expansion by this Board action.
 NewPush has a positive and cost effective record with RTD in hosting elements of the current
SMT system. NewPush has demonstrated a high level of customer service.
 NewPush’s current services were competitively selected and this is likely the lowest cost, best
value solution.

Packet Pg. 148

2.13.E




Con:



The current scope of the NewPush contract includes hosting SMT servers, the ticket vending
machine banking server. Therefore, we know that NewPush already has completed a PCI
compliance self-assessment for RTD services.
Hosting with any other hosting vendor would create duplication of costs for providing high
availability connections, firewalls and auditing security of the system.
Having initially planned to do hosting with Xerox, there is insufficient time remaining to
competitively procure alternative hosting services in order to be ready for the January 1, 2016
anticipated go-live.
NewPush has hosting expertise, but not expertise for SMT applications. RTD will be responsible
for managing applications and Xerox will be required to assist with the migration.
The Board funded $500,000 for off-site hosting in March 2015. This is expected to cover
migration of the SMT system and the first year of SMT hosting services through February 2017.
Subsequent annual costs for SMT hosting are estimated to be between $350,000 and $400,000
per year. With full consideration of the options, it is in RTD’s best interest to move forward with
NewPush for off-site hosting services.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact. The funding for 2015 was already approved by the Board of
Directors in March 2015.
Subsequent years will be included in the 2016-2021 Finance and
Administration Department’s Information Technology Division operating budgets.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with NewPush in
order to expand off-site hosting services for SMT to provide greater security and availability. This
is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with
NewPush to expand off-site hosting services for SMT to provide greater security and availability.
This action would result in RTD continuing to host SMT services in house, exposing RTD’s
customers to risk of outages and greater risk of theft of personal information. This is not the
recommended action.
3. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Xerox in order
to expand off-site hosting services for SMT to provide greater security and availability. It is likely
that this alternative will not provide the necessary services in time for the scheduled go-live dates
and will require additional funds. This is not the recommended action.

Recommendation for Passage of Resolution
Authorizing the General Manager to Execute a
Design Build Contract and other Agreements
for the Southeast Rail Extension

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
resolution authorizing the Chair of the RTD Board of Directors and the General Manager, whether interim
or permanent, or their officers or delegates to execute grant agreements, a two phase design-build
contract, intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), purchase and sale contracts, documents evidencing
property interests, and such other agreements as are necessary or appropriate for the construction of the
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) and to accept third party contributions and increase the project budget
by such third party contribution amounts to implement third party requested betterments, all according
to the terms set forth in the Resolution.
BACKGROUND
On February 21, 2012 the RTD Board of Directors approved selection of a locally preferred alternative
following an environmental study mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as a
prerequisite to seeking federal funding for the SERE. The Board authorized RTD to apply to enter into the
federal new starts grant funding process with the goal of a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) on
August 28, 2012. A Record of Decision (ROD) for the project was issued by the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) on October 17, 2014. FTA has since issued a ROD and has authorized the project
for each phase of development that is a statutory prerequisite to obtaining an FFGA, and the executive
branch of the federal government has included SERE in each report and budget necessary to maintain
FFGA eligibility. RTD anticipates receipt of an FFGA in the first half of 2016.
The Chair and staff members will be required to sign acceptance of the FFGA and other federal grants.
On July 15, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors authorized staff to submit an amendment to the DRCOG
Baseline Report on FasTracks, which contained a listing of projects that would serve as the basis for
inclusion in the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The Southeast Rail Extension was approved to
be included in this list in order to maintain eligibility for and support the RTD intent to seek federal
funding to construct the SERE.
The RTD Board of Directors authorized staff to issue a request for proposals for a design build contract
for construction SERE.
Responses were received from several qualified teams and a team
recommendation is described below.
Throughout the NEPA, funding, and procurement processes RTD staff have been engaged in negotiations
with the City of Lone Tree (Lone Tree), Ridgegate Investments, Inc. (Ridgegate), owner of significant
amounts of needed right of way, and Rampart Range Metropolitan District (RRMD), an additional
property owner, regarding project development.

Packet Pg. 151

2.13.F

Based on evaluation criteria and processes discussed below RTD staff recommends selection of a
design-build contractor and execution of a two phase contract, the construction phase of which will be
dependent on receipt of an FFGA.
Lone Tree is prepared to contribute funds of $25 million to the project and property interests necessary
for construction and operation on entry into an IGA as more fully described below.
RRMD is prepared to contribute property interests necessary for construction and operation on entry into
an IGA as more fully described below.
Ridgegate is prepared to contribute property interests necessary for construction and operation on entry
into a Purchase and Sale Agreement and supplemental agreements and deeds as more fully described
below.
DISCUSSION
The FFGA
Following completion of NEPA work and selection by the RTD Board of a locally preferred alternative,
RTD requested authority from FTA to enter into the first phase of Project Development which is
Preliminary Engineering. FTA authorized the first phase of Project Development in April 2013. Following
the Board’s authorization to include the project in the DRCOG RTD in July 2014 RTD requested
authorization to enter the Engineering Phase of Project Development in September 2014 which was
granted. The President’s budget for 2016 included the project, indicating that FTA is planning to issue
an FFGA next year. RTD hopes to receive the FFGA in the first half of 2016. The Chair and members of
RTD will be required to execute the FFGA as it is a contract between FTA and RTD. It obligates RTD to
complete the project within a specific time frame, to follow all federal terms and conditions including
Buy America, Davis Bacon Wages, construction of the project defined through the NEPA analysis and to
be responsible for all costs other than the FFGA contribution.
The Design-Build Contract
The Southeast Rail Extension is a 2.3 mile double track extension of light rail from the existing Lincoln
Station to a new end of line station south of Ridgegate Parkway. There will be two additional new
stations as well as three bridge structures.
After completing 65% design using RTD engineering staff, RTD embarked on a two-step procurement
process in November 2014 to select a Design-Build Contractor for the Southeast Rail Extension.
Requests for Qualifications (RFQ) were provided to the contracting community on November 17, 2014.
On January 16, 2015, RTD received 7 Statement of Qualifications (SOQ). Following a two week review
process, RTD shortlisted the following teams to receive an invitation to propose on the project in the
form of Request for Proposals (RFP):
1) Kiewit with Hatch Mott McDonald and Mass Electric
2) Balfour Beatty with Parsons Brinckerhoff
3) Stacy and Witbeck/Herzog Joint Venture with STV and Wadsworth
4) Graham/Kraemer Joint Venture with Stantec
The Request for Proposals were sent to the four teams on February 27, 2015 with the deadline for
proposals set for May 15, 2015. One on one meetings were held with each of the proposing teams
during the proposal period. Additionally RTD received numerous questions from each team as well as
Alternative Technical Concepts (ATC’s). On April 27, 2015, RTD provided final responses to all
questions and ATC’s in the form of a final addendum to the RFP.
On May 15, 2015, RTD received proposals from all four shortlisted teams. RTD staff evaluated and
scored the proposals based on the following four areas:
1) Technical Approach, Technical Innovation and Creativity (35 Points)

Packet Pg. 152

2.13.F

2) Management Approach, Experience and Approach (10 Points)
3) DBE/SBE/WIN Approach (10 Points)
4) Cost Proposal (45 Points)
In addition to this evaluation, a group of stakeholders also reviewed the proposals and provided their
input in the form of pros and cons.
The evaluation of the Technical, Management, and Cost Proposals were conducted separately. After
review and scoring by each Technical and Management Working Groups, those scores were provided to
a Technical Subcommittee which then prepared a recommendation to the Evaluation Committee which
consisted of members of RTD’s Senior Leadership Team. At the Evaluation Committee Meeting, the
results of the Technical and Management Approach Working Groups were combined with the scoring of
the Cost Proposal Working Group.
The Balfour Beatty/Parson Brinckerhoff team scored the highest with a score of 83.31, rating number
one in Technical, SBE and Cost, and number two in Management. Their price is $139,769,254.00,
which is also the lowest of the proposers.
The following basic components are included in the contract:
1) Lump Sum Contract Price.
2) RTD set a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 20% for design and 24% for
construction. The contractor has committed to exceed those goals by an additional .5% each.
The contractor has also presented a plan to include to a voluntary Small Business Enterprise
(SBE) goal of 6%.
3) The Project hiring goals for Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) graduates are as follows:
a. Professional Service – Goal 8.5%: Participants may perform professional services such
as design, quality control, quality assurance, surveying, contract administration,
easement acquisition, and public information duties.
b. Skilled Craft – Goal 13.11%: Participants should perform skilled construction related
activities such as carpentry, masonry, iron worker, equipment operator, mechanic
work, or similar skilled construction work.
4) Davis-Bacon and Buy America Requirements – The contractor will be required to use DavisBacon wage rates and comply with Buy America Requirements.
The Lone Tree IGA
Lone Tree has agreed to be responsible for the cash contribution of $25 million for the construction of
SERE. RTD has been advised that other parties benefitting from the project will be contributing to the
$25 million but RTD will need to sign an IGA with only one entity, Lone Tree, to receive those funds.
The IGA will allow Lone Tree to use federal grant funds that would not otherwise have been available to
RTD as part of its payment. Funds will be paid over a three year period anticipated to meet RTD’s
construction cash flow needs. In addition to the cash contribution, Lone Tree is contributing property
rights in the form of deeds and non-revocable licenses to property worth about $50,000 in addition to
the cash. It is also contributing staff time and waiving permit fees with an estimated value of
$150,000.00. In consideration for the Lone Tree contributions and as a prerequisite to their receipt, RTD
must receive the FFGA and award a contract for the construction of the project. If RTD has not started
revenue service by 2020 it must reimburse Lone Tree unless RTD continues to make diligent progress.
Lone Tree is entitled to review all project plans, and all facilities that require local government permitting
will be subject to Lone Tree’s codes, ordinances and standards. The IGA also commits that RTD is
building some temporary drainage and roadway facilities that will be replaced with shared or public
facilities as additional infrastructure is developed in Lone Tree.
The RRMD IGA
The RRMD IGA Rampart Range Metropolitan District, a political subdivision of the State of Colorado is
conveying property required for construction of the line, subject to RTD’s consummation of its

Packet Pg. 153

2.13.F

transactions with Ridgegate for its property and receipt of the FFGA. RTD estimates the value of the
property being donated by RRMD is over $800,000.
The Ridgegate Agreements
RTD will require right of way and easements from Ridgegate. RTD is acquiring a total of more than 10
acres and drainage and septic easements. The easements will be replaced with shared municipal
drainage and utilities as the area is developed. Closing on all real estate interests is contingent on RTD’s
receipt of an FFGA and proceeding with construction of the project along with satisfaction of title and
escrow matters and completion of the IGAs described above. RTD estimates the value of property being
donated by RIdgegate is about $2 million.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The current projected budget for the Southeast Rail Extension is $233.1 million. This total includes
$34.4 million that was spent through the end of 2014 on environmental analysis, preliminary
engineering and design, and the acquisition of eight light rail vehicles for the project.
The remaining budget for the project from 2015-2019 is projected at $198.7 million. Funding for the
remaining costs is projected to come from the following sources:
FTA Full Funding Grant Agreement

$92.0

FTA CMAQ Funds

7.5

Cash Contribution - Local Entities per IGA

25.0

In-Kind Contribution - Local Entities per IGA

3.0

RTD Local Funding

71.2

Total Remaining Funding

$198.7

Per the current budget projections, RTD would be responsible for 35.8% of the remaining project costs.
The local funding partners would contribute 14.1% of the remaining project cost, and federal grants
would provide 50.1% of the remaining funding. The RTD funding is included in the 2014 Board adopted
FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation and is programmed over the construction period.
Board authorization for Phase I of the Project will allow expenditures up to $24.4 million for design,
related staff costs, and some land acquisition costs from parties other than Lone Tree, Ridgegate and
RRMD. A transfer of $15,180,408 from the FasTracks Management Reserve to the project budget is
also included in the Resolution to cover a portion of the Phase I costs. The remainder of the $24.4
million will be included in the 2016 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the
attached resolution authorizing the Chair of the RTD Board of Directors and the General Manager,
whether interim or permanent, or their officers or delegates to execute grant agreements, a two
phase design-build contract, intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), purchase and sale contracts,
documents evidencing property interests, and such other agreements as are necessary or
appropriate for the construction of the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) and to accept third party
contributions and increase the project budget by such third party contribution amounts to
implement third party requested betterments, all according to the terms set forth in the Resolution
2. Do not pass the attached resolution. This will jeopardize receipt of an FFGA and construction of
the project. This will put third party funding contributions including cash, right of way and staff
time in jeopardy.

Why the Southeast Rail Extension
• Consistent with Board direction, particularly July 2014 approval to
include in the DRCOG Regional Transportation Plan.
• Opportunity to leverage non-RTD dollars ($28 m), FFGA grant ($92 m),
and CMAQ grant ($7.5 m) so that only $71 m RTD dollars are needed
to complete the Southeast Rail Extension Project and advance the
FasTracks Program promised to the voters in 2004.
• Important to maintain relationship with FTA and build on our history of
success in receiving Federal funds.

Why the Southeast Rail Extension (continued)
• Percentage of Third Party funding is significantly higher than any other
Fastracks corridor.
• A committed construction bid that is within budget.
• Widespread Regional Support – City of Lone Tree, Douglas County, The
Metro Mayors Caucus, the City and County of Denver, The City of Aurora,
the Town of Parker, Several businesses and business groups.
• A good business decision for RTD in enabling a remaining project cost of
$198.7 m to be built with only a 35.8% financial commitment from RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: July 9, 2015

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

July 8, 2015

Subject:

2015-2020 Strategic Plan

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: July 28, 2015

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the
2015-2020 RTD Strategic Plan.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Strategic Plan reflects guidance and direction from the District’s Board of Directors,
supplemented by extensive staff, stakeholder, and public input. The Plan includes material from the
2015 Board Strategic Advance, and Plan content was heavily based upon two separate sets of one-onone meetings with Board members during the first half of 2015.
Key contributions to the Plan are the result of additional outreach including the following:







Thirty employee Listening Sessions held at fifteen different locations;
An Employee Survey completed by 1,363 employees;
A meeting with the RTD Customer Panel;
Meetings with the Citizen’s Advisory Committee (April 15 and July 8, 2015);
A Local Government Planning Meeting (March 12, 2015); and
Results from the 2014 Customer Satisfaction Survey.

The Plan also reflects input from the Board’s June 30, 2015 Study Session.
The Strategic Plan is organized around seven overall strategies reflecting RTD’s mission. These are:
 Customer Service
 Safety
 Financial Sustainability
 Equity and Accessibility
 System Optimization
 Technological Innovation
 Workforce
Each strategy is accompanied by a goal statement, narrative describing the strategic theme in more
detail, and a set of initiatives that articulate short-, medium-, and long-term implementation. Most of
these initiatives are ongoing in nature, and will be a continuous effort during the five-year plan timeframe. Some of the initiatives involve actions that may not come to fruition until beyond the five-year
time-frame but warrant action now.
The Strategic Plan represents a Board-initiated and adopted document that singularly incorporates longerterm policies, complementing other Board efforts and actions. For example, tactical plans such as the
Strategic Budget Plan, FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation, Annual Budget, and Annual Board/Senior
Leadership Team Strategic Planning advance are at a more immediate implementation level while the
Strategic Plan looks at the next five years and well beyond.

Packet Pg. 178

2.13.G

Strategic Plan Implementation will take place in a number of ways. A subsequent document will
describe performance measures to monitor and report on the success of Plan initiatives. In addition, the
Strategic Plan will be referenced during preparation of Board Reports, the Annual Budget, and the
Strategic Budget Plan. Finally, the Board will review the Strategic Plan annually during the Strategic
Planning Advance to check on timeframes, relevance, and content of the seven key strategies identified
in this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial impact attributable to Strategic Plan initiatives has previously been incorporated or will be
considered in the Annual Budget, Strategic Budget Plan, and/or FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation as
appropriate.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the 2015-2020 RTD Strategic Plan.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action.

Strategic Planning Process Flow

The Plan is organized around seven overall strategies serving RTD’s mission. Each strategy is accompanied by a goal statement,
narrative describing the strategic theme in more detail, and a set of initiatives that articulate short-, medium-, and long-term
implementation. Most of these initiatives are ongoing in nature, and will be a continuous effort during the five-year plan time-frame.
Some of the initiatives involve actions that may not come to fruition until beyond the five-year time frame, but warrant action now.

The exhibit on this page provides the context for the Strategic Plan within RTD’s overall planning and budgeting process. As shown,
the Strategic Plan represents the District’s long-term strategy and vision, carefully integrated with the Board’s short-term goals
established during the annual Strategic Planning Advance.

IMPLEMENTATION LEVEL
The Board develops and adopts
both short- and long-term goals,
building on the environmental step.

Tactical plans provide guidance
for future annual Board decisions,
specifying how goals will be
implemented. These plans reflect
goals from the previous step.

The Board uses an array of
performance measures to assess
progress on both short- and longterm goals from the Strategic plan
and the Tactical plans.

FOREWORD
On behalf of the RTD Board of Directors, we adopt the 2015 Strategic
Plan. This Plan reflects the Board’s collective vision for the District
– for both the next five years, and for decades to come as well. The
Board has identified seven strategies that help frame the District’s
big-picture goals, accompanied by initiatives to implement them. This
Plan clearly and simply articulates those goals for our employees,
stakeholders, and most of all, our passengers.
RTD is a complex organization, relying on hundreds of employees to serve nearly 3 million
people spread over 2,340 square miles across the Denver metro area. This complexity,
however, does not obscure the simple strategies and goals that are paramount to the District:
customer service, safety, and financial sustainability. To these we provide additional strategies
and goals that amplify and support our fundamental, basic mission. Included among these is
our commitment to implement the FasTracks program approved by the voters in 2004.
It is the Board’s hope that the Strategic Plan will be our guiding, aspirational document detailing
how we will move forward together. In my previous role as a city Mayor, we always turned to
our comprehensive plan to influence important land use decisions. The Strategic Plan should
serve a similar purpose, helping us make sound choices that direct and shape what RTD is,
what RTD does, and why we do it. This Plan focuses on the next five years, yet looks far into the
future, and we will revisit it periodically as circumstances warrant. The Board is committed to
making decisions based on sound public policy, and the Strategic Plan is a key tool in doing so.

RTD MISSION STATEMENT

RTD Interim General Manager Dave Genova
RTD was created in 1969 by the Colorado General Assembly to
develop, operate, and maintain a mass transportation system. Since
then, the District has made strategic decisions based upon careful
budget planning, attracting and retaining a talented workforce,
and never losing sight of our commitment to our customers and
safety. From our beginnings as a bus company, we have added light
rail, transformed Denver Union Station, and witnessed extensive
development around our transit stations. The FasTracks program,
which will add more light rail, new commuter rail, and new bus rapid transit, is carving an
unmistakable mark on the Denver metro area. It is now time to adopt a Strategic Plan to
move us into the next five years and beyond.
Between 2016 and 2020, RTD will undergo another period of transition as significant
portions of the FasTracks program begin revenue service, and the bulk of our current major
capital expansion program winds down. The Strategic Plan will be an important document
as we move through this transition, since it identifies seven key strategies to focus our
attention. We will build upon a solid foundation, particularly in the safety area, which the
overwhelming majority of RTD employees understand is RTD’s top priority. Additionally,
this plan details how we will enhance customer service, use technology to improve
the customer experience, optimize our growing system, continue to ensure financial
sustainability, and maintain a dynamic workforce. Join me as we maintain RTD’s position as
one of the top transit agencies in the country and continue our strong legacy of providing
safe, reliable transportation to the region.

RTD Board Chair Chuck Sisk

To meet our constituents’ present and future public transportation needs by providing safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the District.

Strategy:
Deliver CustomerOriented Service
Deliver safe, reliable,
and efficient transit
service District-wide.
Engage our customers
to improve services in
an open and transparent
manner.

RTD’s customer experience has to be safe and reliable for RTD
to continue to maintain and grow its customer base. On-time
performance and service reliability will allow RTD to build a
competitive edge within the regional transportation system
as vehicular travel becomes increasingly difficult in the future.
Having a seamless interface between all RTD services—whether
it be bus, Access-a-Ride, light rail or commuter rail—should be a
high priority to ensure RTD customer satisfaction. RTD customers
must feel comfortable and safe on any RTD service, whether it is
run by RTD or one of its contractors.
Responding to customer needs is important in the 21st century.
As rider expectations evolve, RTD must endeavor to meet their
needs with a growing emphasis on technology and immediate,
reliable information. It will be critical for RTD to proactively
engage our customers to seek ways to improve our service,
and to be transparent about the realities of how we operate
our services. Finding new and improved ways to engage
our customers will allow RTD to stay ahead of the curve and
anticipate rather than react to customer needs.

Strategy:
Foster a Safety Culture
Continue to develop
new approaches and
new technologies to create
safer environments for our
riders and our workforce.
Establish best practices
with safety partners to
develop a performancedriven safety culture.

“RTD is the best transit agency in
the country because of our great
team of employees and what you
do every day to safely deliver our
mission.”

RTD recognizes that management and employee commitment is
the hallmark of a true safety culture, where safety is an integral
part of daily operations. To support safety’s priority in the agency,
RTD will strengthen accountability systems and promote a safety
culture. Safety accountability includes establishing safety goals,
measuring safety activity, eliminating hazards and unsafe work
behaviors, and proactively improving the safety environment.
In the recent employee survey more than 70% of employees
responded favorably to questions about RTD’s safety priorities
(72%), the safety of their work life (76%) and the ease with which
they can report safety concerns (84%). Still, maintaining safe
service requires constant vigilance and collaboration throughout
the agency. Through the Strategic Plan, RTD looks to improve
customer and employee safety by encouraging respectful
collaboration founded on mutual trust. RTD has an organizational
commitment to establish the core value of safety. RTD will
further promote a positive safety culture where values, attitudes,
competencies and patterns of behavior will improve the health
and safety of employees and customers. RTD will continue to
build on an already robust safety culture through enhanced
employee engagement. Ultimately, safety is each employee’s
responsibility.

Strategy:
Strengthen Fiscal
Resiliency and Explore
Financial Innovation
Ensure cost-effective and
responsible use of funding
and proactively pursue
partnerships to supplement
District resources. Strengthen
fiscal resiliency and explore
financial innovation to keep
the system in a state of
good repair and deliver
better service.

RTD has the responsibility to use taxpayer and passenger dollars
to provide the best possible public transit service. To consistently
deliver excellent services and projects, RTD must maintain
financial stability. Multi-year financial planning is vital to ensure
that capital and service visions become realities. The agency can
augment its finances by maximizing the revenues it generates
through operations and by exploring new sources of income.
Traditional funding sources alone will be insufficient to meet
the long-term needs of the future RTD system. RTD must also
continue to seek out non-traditional partnerships with public and
private sector partners to leverage outside funds.
Even as RTD employs asset management programs and
endeavors to keep the system in a state of good repair,
ongoing investment must be sustained to keep its vehicles and
infrastructure functioning and to maintain a robust system. These
assets often require more frequent maintenance to ensure
safety and ongoing functionality, which puts a growing burden
on the operating budget. Reliable and sustainable funding will
be absolutely necessary for RTD to make the critical investments
that the region needs. A long-term comprehensive funding
plan that takes into account both operating and capital needs is
essential to creating a robust, modern transit system.

A balanced approach to accessing RTD facilities will be important
in order to continue to expanding and increase RTD’s customer
base. Active transportation options such as walking, biking, car
share, and ride share should be embraced as viable alternatives
to access RTD facilities in addition to personal vehicles and buses.
Improved first and final mile connections through partnerships with

Ride service and ADA access to fixed route service, are key to
preserving mobility for the disabled community.
Promoting the creation of diverse transit oriented communities
around our facilities serves RTD well by improving accessibility
near stations and expanding RTD’s ridership base. Local
jurisdictions have prioritized development around RTD facilities
as means to direct future growth. RTD should proactively partner
with local jurisdictions and others to leverage this planning vision
and create vibrant, walkable areas around stations. In creating
these transit oriented communities, RTD needs to be sensitive to
community issues such as affordable housing and transportation,
and should work with local jurisdictions and others to find
solutions to promote neighborhood diversity.

RTD began as a bus company and has expanded with the Central,
Southwest, Southeast, Central Platte Valley, and West light rail
lines. The District has also added a variety of other transportation
options, including Call-n-Ride, Access-a-Ride, Limited stop bus
services, Express and Regional bus services, and an extensive
Park-n-Ride system.

Strategy:
Optimize Service
Delivery
Balance competing
mobility needs across
the District to provide
service in the most efficient
manner possible. Work with
partners to develop, fund
and complete FasTracks and
increase ridership.

The FasTracks program represents one of the most ambitious,
large-scale transit expansion programs ever undertaken in
the United States. The combination of light rail, commuter rail,
downtown circulation, and bus rapid transit capital investment
projects—as well as Denver Union Station and its integrated
transit oriented development—is destined to transform the
Denver metropolitan region. A key effort over the next five
years will be to carefully integrate the FasTracks projects into
our existing bus and rail system.

While most of FasTracks will be in service by 2020, key
components of the program will likely not be completed. During
the next five years, the District is committed to exploring financial
and implementation strategies to keep these unfinished projects
in the forefront to fully realize the voters’ 2004 vision. It is
unlikely that RTD can fully fund these projects from FasTracks
sales tax revenues in the near term, so partnerships with local
governments and private companies will become an integral
component of the funding strategy.
FasTracks, however, will not meet all the transit demands
expected during the longer time horizon of 15 to 25 years.
These 2040 transit needs, based on Denver Regional Council
of Governments jobs and housing growth projections, must
be planned for implementation a decade or more from now.
Addressing these needs may require improving the existing
system’s capacity. Other needs will likely be met by a thorough
exploration of bus rapid transit investments throughout the
District, both on arterial streets and on State highways. Finally,
RTD will need to explore visionary approaches to linking the
District’s light rail, commuter rail, and bus rapid transit systems
with other transit systems serving the rest of the Front Range.

Employing technology can help RTD not only increase ridership
but also better manage its business, assets, and operations.
Customer expectations are changing with a shift in rider
demographics, travel patterns and needs. Meeting customer
needs means providing access to information, ensuring
connectivity with devices throughout the system, and employing
the technological innovations that have become the norm. A
public transportation system that is easy to understand and use
is not only important in attracting and retaining riders but also in
increasing market share. Technology-based customer information
tools are essential to inform riders about transit services and help
them easily navigate the RTD system.
Just as technology can help customers make better decisions
about travel, new tools at the system level will help RTD make
and implement better strategic and investment decisions that
can save time and money. The challenge is to systematically
develop and introduce these new tools, for both customers and
RTD processes, while staying up to date in new technological
innovation.

RTD recognizes that our employees are the single most important
asset in the organization. As the baby-boomer generation
nears retirement, the agency needs an ever-greater focus on
recruiting and training employees with competitive benefits while
providing the knowledge and skills for those employees to build
their careers in public transportation. Additionally, a coordinated
effort to capture the experience and knowledge from the current
workforce will pass knowledge to the next generation.

Strategy:
Foster a Dynamic and
Sustainable Workforce
Attract and serve a
dynamic workforce with
competitive benefits
and career advancement
opportunities. Improve
collaboration and
communication between
workgroups while
transferring knowledge to
the next generation.

The upcoming completion of a large percentage of FasTracks will
also require that RTD examine the best use of resources to shift
focus from construction to maintaining existing and new assets.
Results from the recently-conducted employee survey show that
the agency’s focus on safety and customer service are wellestablished at every level of the organization. However, that
survey also revealed concerns about internal communication and
collaboration. RTD has made a commitment to improve two-way
communication to ensure that every employee’s voice counts.

Strategic Plan implementation will take place in a number of ways.
A subsequent document will describe performance measures to
monitor and report on the success of Plan initiatives. In addition, the
Strategic Plan will be referenced during preparation of Board Reports,
the Annual Operating Budget, and the Strategic Budget Plan. Finally,
the Board will review the Strategic Plan annually during the Strategic
Planning Advance to check on timeliness, relevance and content of
the seven key strategies identified in this document.
