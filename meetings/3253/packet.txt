BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022-2027 Mid-Term Financial Plan

Committee Meeting Date:
October 19, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
October 19, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2022-2027 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Budget Analyst IV
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2022-2027 MTFP is the six-year financial forecast used as the basis for the development of the
2022 Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning. The development of this forecast
seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding sources in alignment with
RTD’s Strategic Plan. Adoption of the 2022-2027 MTFP by the Board is not a commitment or
appropriation of funding.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s financial projections have improved since the Board last approved an MTFP in November 2020. In
the intervening period, RTD has gained additional clarity regarding one-time and recurring revenue
streams and has defined a clearer path forward for service levels, state of good repair and other
expenditures.
2022-2027 Changes Since November 2020 MTFP
• Fare revenue reduction of $94 million including a modest decrease in 2024 as a cautious
approach related to potential results of the System-wide Fare Study and Equity Analysis. No fare
increase is contemplated.
• Sales and use tax projections provided in September 2021 by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business projecting a $339 million increase. Includes cap on Base System growth of
2% after 2024 for Taxpayer Bill of Rights limits
• Additional federal COVID-19 relief funding apportionments of $542 million for a total of $774
million
• Operating expense increase of $577 million for 85% service levels and inflationary increases
• Debt service decrease of $129 million due to debt refinancing for interest savings
• Asset management of additional $163 million for state of good repair
• Increase in reserves of $118 million
Current Outlook
• The 2022-2027 period balances funding sources and uses while strengthening reserves
• Service levels at 85% of pre-COVID levels

Packet Pg. 3

•
•

Funding of full asset management backlog plus ongoing needs
Debt service coverage ratio policy of 1.2x is met or exceeded each year
Reserves of three months operating expenses met in each year
Base System funding will supplement FasTracks
No new projects are included

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2022-2027 MTFP projects balanced funding sources and uses while meeting asset management
needs and fiscal policy requirements for reserves and debt service coverage ratios.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Sales and Use Tax Update

Committee Meeting Date:
October 19, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fiscal Policy requires that:
RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting containing
projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), mid-term (six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan period)
and long-term (30-year Long Range Financial Plan period). The purpose is to provide RTD with expert
economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not
available internally.
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model reports in March
and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s annual budget and six-year Mid-term
Financial Plan (MTFP). The provision of the forecast model report is followed by a presentation to the
Board by CU Leeds in April and October.
DISCUSSION
RTD has included the September 2021 sales and use tax forecast in the 2022-2027 MTFP.
The September 2021 Forecast Model Report reflects a projected improvement from the March forecast
in RTD’s sales and use taxes.
The September 2021 Forecast Model Report will be provided with the October 2021 Board Briefing
materials.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The September 2021 Forecast Model Report results in the following changes to the sales and use tax
forecast from the March 2021 Forecast Model Report:
• 2022 Budget
+$42.2 million
• 2022-2027 MTFP
+$319.5 million

2022 Proposed Budget

Committee Meeting Date:
October 19, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Budget Analyst IV
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to CRS 29-1-101, RTD will offer for public review by October 15, 2021 its 2022 Proposed
Budget and will provide a transparent appropriation process allowing for Board and public input and
comment. Staff will then present the 2022 Proposed Budget for its consideration by the Board in
November 2021 which will include a description of any changes since the presentation of the 2022
Proposed Budget.
The 2022 Proposed Budget and associated attachments are included in this Board Discussion item and
will also be posted to the RTD website with hard copies available in the Board Office for public review.
The 2022-2027 Mid-term Financial Plan, which has been discussed during Board committee meetings
held during August and September 2021 and presented for approval in the October 19, 2021 Finance,
Administration and Audit Board Committee, informs the development and consideration of approval of
the 2022 Budget.
DISCUSSION
The attached 2022 Proposed Budget document includes narratives describing the financial assumptions
and alignment with the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan. In addition, tables, charts and commentary are
included for evaluation of the considerations included therein.
Staff has developed the 2022 Proposed Budget to conform with RTD’s Fiscal Policy directives while best
meeting the transit needs of its customers and communities at large.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2022 Proposed Budget aligns expenditures with anticipated funding sources resulting in a balanced
budget while solidifying RTD’s financial position. RTD’s internal controls and budget appropriation and
amendment process provide those charged with leadership and governance responsibilities the
opportunity to adjust and realign appropriations throughout the fiscal year as necessary.

The Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) 2022 Proposed Budget (Budget) represents the expected
revenues, expenditures and financial position anticipated for the fiscal year January 1 through December
31, 2022. The RTD Board of Directors appropriates funding by fiscal year which allows RTD to continue
its mission to make lives better through connections. The expenditures set forth herein align the Budget
with RTD’s Strategic Plan Priorities within the projected financial constraints.
This Budget demonstrates RTD’s financial capacity to address the agency’s strategic priorities based on
current information. The development of the Budget is a cross-departmental collaborative effort in which
the final request to the Board has the concurrence of staff.

Perspective
The impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic had a significant financial impact to RTD beginning in March 2020,
the effects of which are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Initial indications were that
annual revenues would decrease by $250 million (25%) from ridership losses and economic austerity
affecting RTD’s fare and sales and use tax revenues. In response, RTD implemented immediate measures
to reduce expenditures and adjust transit activities which had a profound effect on employees, customers
and communities.
During the ensuing months, RTD has revised its financial expectations as a result of improving revenues,
federal relief funding and current economic forecasts. Current information indicates that the financial
impact of the Pandemic has not been as grave as anticipated, albeit financial constraints are expected to
remain.
Prior to the Pandemic much of RTD’s focus was to complete expansion projects. During the Pandemic,
cost reduction efforts required deferral of significant asset management needs. The effect of these
measures has resulted in a substantial backlog of assets combined with service realignment considerations,
both of which will require substantial resource commitments. The near-term fiscal periods will require
RTD to prioritize the aforementioned in order to maintain a reliable transit system.
This Budget request sets a financial course that is prudent and strategic while providing the foundation
for financial sustainability.
The underpinnings of these requested appropriations are to provide a level of service commensurate with
available resources that best meets the needs of RTD customers and communities as well as a focus on
RTD’s fiduciary duty to maintain its assets in a state of good repair. Minimal funding has been identified
for expansionary or new projects.

Guidance for restoration
o Restore reserves to three months, if possible
o Do not utilize existing FISA balances
o Limit the use of “rubber tire” service contributions to the FISA
o Restore deferred projects related to compliance or safety
o Restore service as ridership allows

Financial Discussion and Analysis
The financial aspects of a budget consist of three primary categories: revenues, expenditures and
reserves. Revenues and expenditures provide the cash inflows and outflows while reserves provide the
financial balance to smooth cash flow volatility and supply the financial relief necessary for unforeseen
circumstances that inevitably arise.

Revenues
Revenue sources are generally either recurring or finite. RTD’s Fiscal Policy establishes that one-time
revenues be used for one-time expenditures while recurring revenues provide a sustainable source to fund
ongoing needs. Because one-time revenues have a finite term, commitments for recurring expenditures
require an alternative source once the one-time revenues are exhausted.
RTD’s sources of recurring revenue, in descending order of size, are sales and use taxes, fares, federal
operating grants and miscellaneous revenue from advertising, investment income and rent. Historically,
RTD has also been the recipient of one-time revenues from federal capital grants, federal COVID-19 relief
funding, local contributions and land sales. RTD does not budget or forecast one-time revenues unless
certainty exists.
Revenue assumptions for the Budget include the following:
•

Gradual, modest ridership growth is expected to increase fare revenue in 2022 to 79% of preCOVID levels after decreasing to 49% in 2020. Ridership is projected in the Budget to increase
from 70% of pre-COVID levels in January 2022 to 85% by the fourth quarter of 2022. This
projection is based on an analysis and report from Standard and Poor’s which projects a gradual
transit ridership recovery although there is an expectation of a permanent 20% nationwide loss of
ridership due to remote work and emerging competing transportation options.

•

Sales and use tax projections were provided by the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business
in September 2021. Moody’s economic forecasts assume strong growth resulting from higher
personal income and savings growth occurring during the Pandemic. The Budget contemplates a
$130 million increase from 2019 tax receipts. The RTD forecast aligns with the statewide
expectations from the Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) and Office of State Budgeting and
Planning (OSPB).

1.C.2.b

•

Operating grants from the FTA are a recurring revenue stream to RTD. The grant apportionments
are based upon data that RTD submits to the National Transit Database (NTD). The FTA has
agreed to apportion amounts based on prior year NTD submissions excluding COVID-19 impacts
and RTD expects these 5307 preventive maintenance grants to remain steady year-to-year.

•

COVID-19 relief grants are anticipated to provide $101 million in each of years 2022-2024 as RTD
continues to draw down the remaining amounts of the $774 million relief apportionments. This is
one-time funding that replaces tax revenues which, in turn, will be directed towards the asset
management backlog.

•

Other revenue is recurring revenue of $17 million which consists largely of a federal Build America
Bonds (BAB) interest rate subsidy and advertising revenues. No investment income is budgeted
due to the extremely low yields currently being paid.

Expenditures
Expenditures consist of both recurring expenses, such as operating expenses, as well as occasional outlays
such as debt service and capital expenditures.
RTD’s largest expenditure is providing transit-related operations. These costs include compensation,
materials and supplies, contracted services, insurance, utilities and other such expenses.
RTD also has a significant debt burden primarily from capital expansion projects as well as obligations
issued to finance the purchase of rolling stock.
Furthermore, RTD has ongoing asset management needs that average approximately $120 million
annually. Asset management needs can fluctuate significantly by year when, for example, a single year
includes a large purchase such as revenue vehicles.
Expenditure assumptions for the Budget include:
•

Salaries and wages assume full staffing to provide 85% service levels (see forthcoming headcount
discussion). Financial provisions have been included for collective bargaining and other potential
increases such as recommendations from the classification and compensation analysis as well as
Pay for Performance initiatives.

•

Benefits include the following:
o A $2 million increase for represented employee health and welfare benefit increases
o No increase for non-represented employee health and welfare benefits with Kaiser rates
decreasing slightly and CIGNA premium increases covered by higher employee deductions
per prior Board direction.
o Provision has been made for represented employee pension plan contributions, the terms
of which are to be negotiated with the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001. This
pension plan is currently 50% funded.
o An $8.4 million contribution to the non-represented employee pension plan is included
based on the actuarial recommended contribution and unanimous recommendation from
the Trustees of the Salaried Employee Pension Plan. The contribution in 2021 was $6.1
million which was $2 million lower than actuarial recommendations due to financial
constraints. This plan has been closed to new participants since January 1, 2008 and the
$8.4 million contribution covers the additional benefits to be earned in 2022 while also
reducing the unfunded liability. This pension plan is currently 78% funded.
o A 9% contribution to the non-represented employee retirement plan is included. Board
policy is to contribute 7-9% of wages each year. In 2021, the Board reduced the
contribution from 9% in 2020 to 7% due to financial constraints. The increase to 9% in
2022 raises the contributions by approximately $1 million. A 9% contribution is in parity
with the normal cost of the represented pension plan contribution of 8.7% and nonrepresented pension plan normal cost contribution of 9%. The retirement plan Trustees
unanimously recommend a 9% contribution. Only non-represented employees hired
January 1, 2008 and thereafter participate in this retirement plan.

•

Materials and supplies consist of consumable items such as fuel, fluids and parts. Diesel fuel
purchases have been contracted at $2.30 per gallon giving budget certainty. Fuel and vehicle parts
needs are expected to increase $4 million (8%) in 2022 due to restoration of service.

•

Services consist of contracted specialty IT and legal needs as well as security. Additionally, these
expenses contain inflationary increases which are offset by reductions resulting in a $14.4 million
decrease in 2022. No new services have been included. $200,000 has been budgeted for a zero
emission fleet consultant.

•

Insurance costs have decreased over past years due to effective claims management despite the
state increase in government liability caps. The 2022 budgeted costs include the appropriation of
15 months of premiums costs for railroad liability insurance for commuter rail in order to establish
a calendar year policy term that previously expired in September 2021. Insurance costs will remain
relatively flat vs. prior years despite the additional costs associated with opening the N Line.

•

Other expenses primarily contain expenditures for utilities and purchased transportation and, to a
lesser degree, various minor business expenses.

o

Utilities include projected amounts for traction power commensurate with planned rail
service levels
Purchased transportation includes contractual increases and are aligned with expected
revenue service hours

Travel budgets have been eliminated from departmental budgets with a $250,000
placeholder available if travel restrictions are lifted. Expenses for each Director have been
budgeted at $3,000 per individual to allow for local travel
Funding employee development training has been budgeted at $300,000
Funding for an on-call contract of $1 million is included to address specialty consulting
engagements, if necessary
A budget of $250,000 is available for employee engagement to be used for outreach and
recognition programs. All other discretionary spending will continue to be limited.

Debt service represents a significant portion of RTD’s annual expenditures. Debt service consists
of principal and interest payments on bonds, certificates of participation (COPs) and lease-purchase
agreements. Debt service payments for 2022 will total $236.6 million. The Base System bond
payments will expire in 2024, at which point, the Base System will be subject to the Taxpayer Bill
of Rights (TABOR) restrictions. The debt service has been structured such that the Base System
will subsidize FasTracks in 2025 and beyond. RTD’s outstanding debt is $3.2 billion as of October
2021.
