PEGGY CATLIN: Who is on 2411?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Sorry, Director Catlin. That's me, Director Folska, 2411.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Director Folska.
Who is 2733?
BOB BROOM: 2733, Bob Broom.
PEGGY CATLIN: Hi, Bob.
0958?
JOHN MCKAY: That's John McKay. Good morning.
PEGGY CATLIN: Hi, John.
And 9224?
SHELLEY COOK: That's Shelley. Good morning.
PEGGY CATLIN: Hi, Shelley.
OK. It looks like we have Director Guissinger, Director Menten, Director Mihalik, Chair RiveraMalpiede, Director Lewis, Director Tisdale, Director Walker, and Director Whitmore on the
Zoom call. And on the phone we have Directors Folska and Broom and Cook.
VINCE BUZEK: Buzek is on Teams.
PEGGY CATLIN: Buzek. OK. Wow, you're not showing up for me. Well, your smiling face is
there but your name isn't appearing on the bar. OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Are you seeing Barbara McManus?
PEGGY CATLIN: Barbara, you're breaking up.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Are you seeing me all the way at the top? Director Buzek's right
underneath me.
PEGGY CATLIN: No, it's a different order on mine. You're on the lower left and Buzek's on the
upper right. They're not on the same order on everybody's screen.

So I see Director Whitmore has joined us. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-- Director Williams-- 9, 10, 11,
12, 13 Directors. Is that what you have, Barbara?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. We're missing-PEGGY CATLIN: Missing Director Lubow.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: I may not have counted myself. 1, 2-BARBARA MCMANUS: I think it's just Lubow.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Perhaps I should wait a few minutes before calling this to order.
[COMPUTER TONE]
LYNN GUISSINGER: Peggy, we could go ahead and explain the change in the questions. Is that
OK?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah. Why don't we go ahead? And Lynn, do you want to take a crack at it,
since this was your-BARBARA MCMANUS: Do you want to call the meeting to order?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes, I can do that.
Like to call the GM Executive Search GMOC Committee meeting to order on Wednesday,
August 19 at 7:51 AM.
Like to first do a little of housekeeping. And I'll turn it over to Director Guissinger to talk about
some of the adjustments that have been made to the questions and the rationale behind it. Go
ahead.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK. Thanks.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Lubow has joined. So I think we're all here.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, great. OK.
We ended up with 17 questions. And we've had 9 for our one-hour interview. And we had heard
people say they wanted time for follow up, and it made sense to have a little time for them to ask
questions. So we cut two out this morning, cut out what was question 5, moved Jeff Walker to

what was question 6. It's now question 5, regulatory bodies. And then we cut out the second pass
question which I had submitted, but Claudia raises that issue.
And then Shontel is going to ask the question about the candidate's biggest worry or concern,
now question number 14. Both of those we put as follow up potential at the end. And I did leave
Walker on that first question. The second one, I didn't put anyone. But it's just, you know, see
how we do time wise and go from there. Thanks.
PEGGY CATLIN: Are there any questions? Remember, in Teams, if you have it, you can raise
your digital hand.
OK. In terms of follow-up questions, we would ask that you limit a follow-up question-- if you
want one, you don't have to have one for every question-- but you limit the follow-up question to
only one. We don't want a line of questioning of, let's say, five minutes from a director [AUDIO
OUT].
Director Williams, I see your hand up.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes. Director Catlin, I don't know about anybody else, but I will have to
leave this meeting completely in order to go to the next one. Teams eats up so much of my
capacity that I cannot run two at once. So I just want you to know that I'm going to turn this one
off, turn the other one on, might take me a minute.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Thank you for the heads up. I have to do the same thing. So it's good to
know.
All right. So I'd like to take a motion to move into Executive Session pursuant to 24-6402(4)(f)(l) Colorado Revised Statute for consideration of personnel matters regarding
interviews of GM/CEO finalists.
Do I have a motion?
DOUG TISDALE: So moved. Now I'd like to speak to the motion.
PEGGY CATLIN: Was that Doug Tisdale?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes. I've moved it, and I believe Director Williams created a second there.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Is there discussion?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes. As I said, I wanted to speak to the motion, just very briefly to ask in
terms of keeping this session open and going into the Exec, can I have just a 30-second tutorial?
Because I know Director Williams said she's going to log out and log back in. But apparently
there's the capacity, (COUGHS), excuse me, if our system will allow, that we can actually keep
this meeting open, apparently minimize it and open up the other one. And I'm wondering if
somebody can give us a 30-second tutorial on that.

PEGGY CATLIN: I'm going to ask John McKay to do that.
JOHN MCKAY: Sure. If you would just go to your calendar and then click on the next meeting,
what will happen is this instance will just sort of float up in the top left corner of your screen.
You'll be able to rejoin it at 3:00 or whenever, 2:00, whenever we get back into this. But it'll just
be a persistent icon up in the top left corner on your screen until you close it.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you, sir. That's all I needed to know.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Is there any objection from Directors to moving into Executive Session?
Hearing none, I'll take that as an affirmative vote. We are moving into Executive Session at 7:55,
back at 8:00 AM.
[COMPUTER TONES]
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Hello? Hello?
PEGGY CATLIN: Good morning.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I just want to know if you can hear me and not on mute like I was last
time.
NATALIE MENTEN: I can hear you, Claudia.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you.
NATALIE MENTEN: Claudia, say something again now, before we get into [COMPUTER
DINGS].
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Lubow, Director Guissinger, Director Mihalik, Chair RiveraMalpiede, Director Lewis, Director Tisdale, Director Whitmore. And on the phone we have
Director Broom, Director-- or no, John McKay, Director Menten, Director Buzek, and Director
Williams, and then Director Walker. So I think we're all here.
So at, let me see, at 2:50 PM we are reconvening our open session to have a recap of our day. I
wanted to reiterate that this has been a long but productive and valuable exercise. And I wanted
to personally thank each and every Board member and our staff for all of the hard work that this
has taken.
We have interviewed three outstanding candidates for our new General Manager/CEO and we're
moving on to the next steps.
So with that, I would like to turn it over to our consultant, Gregg Moser, to inform the public
what it is that has taken place over the last couple of hours with regard to public engagement and
what we will be doing in the next couple of days.

Gregg, if you don't mind.
GREGG MOSER: Thank you, Director Catlin. So over the last several hours, we have just
concluded our interviews of the three finalists candidates. And at the same time, the RTD has
made available the video presentations by the candidates, which includes a presentation and a
PowerPoint presentation from each candidate.
And those are available on RTD's website, along with a survey to be able to provide feedback
and comments to the RTD Board on the candidates. In addition to those presentations and that
survey also is the candidates' cover letters and resumes and a brief bio of each candidate. So all
of that information is available on RTD's website.
Information was sent out to RTD stakeholders through an email system that is part of RTD's
process of informing stakeholders of things happening. In addition, I've sent an email out to
several stakeholders as well with that same additional information so that they have access to it.
And I know RTD's offices, Marketing Communications departments, are working to make sure
that information is posted on social media and that updates are provided through the weekend so
that anybody who wants to provide feedback in an anonymous format on the candidates can do
so.
Just to be clear these surveys and the information will be open and available. And the surveys
will be available to be responded to through 11:59 PM on Sunday August 23. So anybody who
wishes to view those, those are available now and they will stay open through Sunday night at
11:59 PM.
After that time, the survey will close because we have to take that feedback and be able to share
it with the Board on Monday, so that they can review that information and be prepared to make a
decision and selection on Tuesday evening.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. Are there any questions from Board members? I did want to state
that the Executive Search Committee, General Manager Oversight Committee will be meeting on
Monday. We will convene and then move into Executive Session to talk about some of the ideas
and parameters for negotiation when we make a selection and enter into negotiation. So that will
take place on Monday, as well as a discussion of the committee members regarding whether or
not they want to make a recommendation to the full board for a candidate to move forward for
discussion and deliberation on Tuesday.
Are there any questions to that?
Again, I want to thank you all for all of your time and hard work and fabulous questions, and
look forward to our discussions on Monday and Tuesday. And again-[INTERPOSING VOICES]

PEGGY CATLIN: --if you have not seen the videos, would you please go ahead and log on to
either listen or watch the videos of the presentations that the candidates taped on Monday.
They're very, very worthwhile. And I think given-CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Just a minute. I'll get to you in a second, Director Folska. But we will-- I
think that it's valuable to have all three, the initial interviews of the candidates, the presentations,
and then today's interviews, to get the whole picture.
Yes, Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: If you could say what time the GMEC meeting is on Monday.
PEGGY CATLIN: Can you repeat that? Because you broke up.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: What time is the GMEC meeting on Monday?
BARBARA MCMANUS: 1:00 to 2:00.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Barbara. I almost said 1:30. Any other questions?
Is there a motion to adjourn today's marathon session?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So moved, Rivera-Malpiede.
DOUG TISDALE: Second.
KATE WILLIAMS: --Williams.
PEGGY CATLIN: Second by Tisdale. Thank you all again. We are adjourned as of 2:56 PM.
Goodbye, all.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Bye.
