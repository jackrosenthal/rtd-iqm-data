BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

April 6, 2017

Subject:

2018 Performance Measures Adoption

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: April 6, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 18, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2018 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2018, there are
41 proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM, which is the same number as in 2017.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and integrate with the Board’s 2018 priorities of Fiscal
Sustainability, Workforce/Human Capital and State of Good Repair. A report detailing year-to-date
performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the end of
each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2018 are brought to the Board of Directors for
approval at this time because the measures are used in development of the 2018-2023 Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) and 2018 Budget.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2017 to 2018 are listed below:


Goal 2.1 Prompt response to facility complaints
The goal for average graffiti complaints per month is raised from ≤ 1.5 per month to ≤
3.0 per month. Our vulnerability to graffiti has increased by at least 50% based on
linear feet for the new corridors and that percentage is expected to increase due to the
nature of the areas through which the W line and R line travel. The existing target of ≤
1.5 complaints per month is unreasonably low.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1



Goal 3.1 System-wide on-time performance
o The goal for system-wide on-time performance is reduced for Local On-Time Bus Service
from 88.0% to 86.0%, and for Regional On-Time Service from 94.0% to 92.0%. Ontime service data has been collected since 2011 using Automated Passenger Counters
that have a GPS component which has enabled the collection of far more accurate data
regarding scheduled and on-time performance. Data counts alone have exceeded
18,000/day vs. 240/day using the previous observational method.
The data
consistently shows on-time performance in the 83%-86% range for local service.
A peer review survey indicated an on-time performance goal of 87.6% on average with
actual on-time performance of 81.9% on average. Peer performance is below RTD’s
current performance of 85.3% and the requested goal of 86%. In order to consistently
meet the current 88%/94% goal, Bus Operations determined that an additional
$2,000,000 in resources would be required.



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o Overall ridership increase will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2018 Budget in November 2017, and is carried as a placeholder at this
time.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o These measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2018 Budget in November 2017 and are carried as placeholders at this time.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2018 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2018 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2018 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2018 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2018 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2018 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2018 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2018 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2018 Performance Report.

1 The measure reports on resolution of customer complaints across all subject matter throughout the District and the
number includes all departments utilizing TrapezeCOM system for commendation and complaint research.
2 All three carriers had a high number of complaints related to missed service or late service (no show, bus late,
discourtesy, passed up passengers at stop) along with a decrease in ridership. “No show” complaints showed an
increase most likely due to the number of routes that were dropped or returned to RTD due to lack of operator
availability.

Subject:

Award of Mobile Ticketing Contract

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: April 6, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 18, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
for the new Mobile Ticketing System to Masabi LLC, in an amount not to exceed $1,450,000. This price
includes the cost for period of performance of a base two-years and three one-year options.
BACKGROUND:
In the fare arena, RTD offers a wide variety of products to meet the unique travel needs of the Rider. At
this time, there are four fundamental methods:
 cash on the bus (single trip or Day Pass);
 cash or credit at RTD ticket vending machines and sales outlets, and retail outlets;
 group accounts through the Smart Card Program (EcoPass, CollegePass, NeighborhoodPass); and
 on-line purchases such as FlexPass and Yahoo Store.
Currently, the medium of the above fare products is by paper ticket, paper pass or a card (MyRide,
EcoPass, CollegePass). The objective of this procurement is to add a mobile ticketing fare “medium” on
a smartphone application (app) that complements the currently available medium. A key element in the
procurement is that the vendor had to demonstrate an existing, functioning and deployed system with
minor configuration allows a reduced time to deliver to RTD of an operating system.
The goal of this project is to implement a day pass (phase 1) and (phase 2) other fare products through
mobile ticketing. Mobile ticketing gives a rider the ability to buy a fare product on their mobile device,
and then to use the mobile device as their fare medium. After electronically purchasing a ride on their
phone, the rider activates the ticket to board the bus or rail service and a ticket appears on the phone
screen for visual validation. RTD receives many requests to offer this type of fare medium.
The vendor will provide second-tier support for customer questions and issues that cannot be easily
resolved or addressed by RTD Customer Care personnel. The vendor will be responsible for all aspects of
receiving and processing payments from customers for fare products and deposit the funds due to RTD.
The product is a Software as a Service (SaaS) implementation, where the vendor provides access to the
software remotely over the Internet. The vendor will provide on-going support and regular support
patches updates for the mobile applications. Any updates to the mobile ticketing applications shall not
affect customers’ purchased fare products, account information, and other associated data. The vendor
also will supply fare inspector enforcement software.
DISCUSSION:
In RTD’s 2014 market survey, three-quarters of RTD customers aged 18-44 had Internet-capable mobile
devices—a penetration surely much higher today, and to be higher still later in 2017. Utilizing mobile

Packet Pg. 16

1.B.2

ticketing, patrons may purchase fare media at their convenience and avoid waiting in line at ticket
vending machines.
The popularity of downloaded applications (apps) on smartphones is huge, and continuing to trend
upwards. For example, Google Play—the main source of apps for the Android platform—reported1 billion
downloads in August 2010; and 65 billion in May 2016.
The RTD riders will be able to download for free the app / software using Google Play or Apple Store.
The rider will need to register and provide a payment option. The vendor provides the daily operations
and support.
RTD advertised an RFP seeking proposals from qualified firms to provide and implement a Mobile
Ticketing System, using a wireless communications enabled mobile devices.
The evaluation team consisted of personnel from the following departments (Bus Operations,
Communications, Finance and Administration and Safety, Security and Asset Management). The
proposals were reviewed in accordance with the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this
procurement including: fulfilling RTD specified design and functionality requirements, cost, offering
functional strength, experience and qualifications and project plan and schedule. After reviewing all six
proposals, interviewing the top two vendors and obtaining clarifying answers, the evaluation team
unanimously selected Masabi, as the Mobile Ticketing Vendor to move forward in the procurement
process.
Some of the strengths of Masabi’s proposal were:
 Back office application includes well designed reports and is integrated with the customer care
tool
 They had iPhone inspection with proven deployment
 The application is fully multilingual and comes with translations
 Ability to frame external trip planner application/ website
 Ability to contact support by opening a ticket via email
 Training plan focuses on ensuring successful roll-out
 Strong security features
Masabi is a London based technology company that develops and markets mobile ticketing services
for public transit companies. The company was founded in 2001. In 2012, the company launched the
first ticketless rail system in the United States, for the MBTA. Masabi’s mobile ticketing and fare
collection solutions are in use by 25 transport agencies and operators around the globe, including: Virgin
Trains, Abellio, London’s Thames Clippers, New Orleans’ RTA, Boston’s MBTA, Transport for Athens,
Los Angeles’ Metrolink and New York’s MTA.
Masabi’s cost model includes capital for implementation and expenses for operation. The expenses are
based on a monthly charge for the inspection application and a transaction fee on ticket sales including
credit card processing fees. Masabi’s cost proposal was for $1,061,000.00 over 5 years based on an
estimated annual day pass ticket sales of $3 million or approximately 480,000 transactions a year.
Masabi’s product will enable RTD to sell additional ticket types. RTD intends to implement additional
ticket types after the initial launch of day pass tickets therefore, it is in RTD’s interest to have contract
authority beyond the proposal amount by $389,000 to allow for these additional products.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Mobile Ticketing System contract cost for deployment is fixed, monthly fixed charge and the
remaining expenses are based on transaction fees on actual total ticket sales. The contract authority
shall not exceed $1,450,000. Funding for this project is included in the associated SBP and Operating
budgets.
ALTERNATIVES

1. Recommended Action: Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract
with Masabi to implement a Mobile Ticketing System. The new service, uses wireless
communications enabled mobile devices, to provide new options for customers to pay for RTD
Fares.
2. Not Recommended: RTD IT staff could be tasked with development of a comparable system,
but it would take away from current assignments and would require substantially more time
and possibly resources to complete.
3. Not Recommended: RTD could choose not to implement a Mobile Ticketing solution.

Subject:

Approval to Enter into Agreements to
Contribute Funding to the Colorado Department
of Transportation for the Mobility Choice
Blueprint Technical Consultant(s)

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: April 18, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into any and all agreements required to provide
$400,000 in Regional Transportation District funding in support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint Study.
RTD’s funds are to be used for the technical consultant(s) selected to conduct the Study, in partnership
with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG), as articulated in this Board report.
BACKGROUND
At the June 2016 Operations & Customer Service Committee meeting, RTD staff briefed the Board
regarding the proposed Mobility Choice Blueprint study effort. The Board was informed that RTD staff
had been participating in discussions with CDOT, DRCOG and the Denver Metro Chamber about forming
a partnership to create a joint public/private mobility vision for metro Denver by developing key
strategies to leverage current assets using new technologies and provide an integrated system for all
users.
At the September 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting, RTD staff presented a
Board Report with a recommendation to participate with CDOT and DRCOG in the funding of the
Mobility Choice Blueprint study effort. The proposal was for the three public agency partners to share
equally in funding the study, with each agency’s share being $500,000. This recommended action failed
in Committee. At the time, key issues identified by some Board Members included: the desire to assure
that the public partners, including RTD, retain a lead role in the oversight of the Study; questions
regarding the flow and management of public funds; concerns regarding the level of the proposed dollar
amount of RTD’s participation ($500,000); and the composition of the Chamber’s Mobility Choice
Board.
At the March 21, 2017 Financial Administration & Audit Committee Meeting, RTD staff presented
updated Mobility Choice (MC) Blueprint information and responded to a number of Board inquiries
regarding the proposed effort. Don Hunt (Acting Managing Director of Mobility Choice, Inc.), Kelly
Brough (President and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce), and Jim Gunning (former Lone
Tree Mayor and proposed Mobility Choice Executive Director) also were in attendance and answered
questions posed to them by Directors. Highlights of the update, based upon Board comments and
questions, include the following:

Packet Pg. 19

1.B.3

Private and Public Sector Participation






The public agencies would take the lead in the study, while the private sector participants would
use the results of the study and any information gained to support projects outside public agency
purview.
One purpose of Mobility Choice is to prevent “siloing” of transportation planning.
Completion of the FasTracks program will not be negatively impacted by Mobility Choice. The
commitment to District voters will not be altered by the study results.
The RTD Board would have a voice at the table during the Mobility Choice effort through regular
feedback during the study.
Participating agencies would determine how to implement study findings, and Mobility Choice
study findings would not be binding on CDOT, DRCOG, or RTD.

MC Board Structure and Role of MC Executive Director









Two economic development organizations have been added to the MC Board to enhance
geographic diversity.
Jim Gunning (proposed MC Executive Director) would be paid through private sector funding.
The current MC Board includes eight private company individuals, three public agency
representatives, two at-large public officials, and two economic development agency
representatives. The charter limits the MC Board to 21 members.
The proposed MC Executive Director position would technically become a program director within
the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce.
The MC Board would oversee the MC Executive Director and Mobility Choice would promulgate a
charter or operating agreement to be approved by the MC Board.
The Mobility Choice Executive Director would be part of the project management team. The
Executive Director would determine whether sufficient funding existed to conduct public outreach
and would look for pilot programs to initiate new transportation modes, among other study
leadership and management responsibilities.
The MC Board has made it clear that MC Board members represent the entire MC Board, rather
than private interests.

Mobility Choice Study





Mobility Choice would include examination of, for example, first/last mile transit, bicycle and
pedestrian access, bus feeder systems, and interactions with transportation network companies
(such as Uber and Lyft).
Colorado academic institutions did not respond to the initial Mobility Choice Request for Interest
(RFI). Academic institutions, however, may respond to the forthcoming Request for Proposal
(RFP) as a project lead or as part of a technical team.
The consultant selection process would be similar to a CDOT or RTD selection process. Private
MC Board members do not have any financial interest in the firms that would conduct the study.
The study would be completed in approximately nine months.

DISCUSSION
The stated purpose of the Mobility Choice Blueprint is to: Maximize existing investments in our
transportation system; leverage technology to plan for our future workforce; and increase economic
opportunities and quality of life. The attachment provides more details on the proposed Mobility Choice
Blueprint Public/Private Initiative. Participating in the Mobility Choice Blueprint Study aligns with the

Packet Pg. 20

1.B.3

District’s 2018 strategic goal – Fiscal Sustainability – by maximizing partnerships and using innovative
approaches.
In response to the issues raised by the RTD Board in September 2016, the Denver Metro Chamber and
Mobility Choice leadership initiated discussions and identified proposed modifications to the original
approach. A description of the key proposed modifications follows.
A management/organizational structure was developed to clearly articulate RTD, DRCOG and CDOT’s
co-lead roles in managing the technical consultant’s work efforts. Under the structure, a Project
Management Team will have direct oversight of the consultant’s work. The Project Management Team
will be comprised of senior representatives of each of the agencies and one representative from the
Mobility Choice Board. Further, CDOT has agreed to take the lead role in procuring the consultant
services, pursuant to State Procurement Rules; and to administer the consultant contract. As such, if
this action is approved, RTD would enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with CDOT for the
funding of the Study. This approach provides assurance that RTD’s interests will be represented and that
the competitively selected Mobility Choice Blueprint consultant team will be responsive to CDOT, RTD
and DRCOG’s oversight and direction. Further, membership on Mobility Choice Board is to be expanded
with the addition of “2 other economic development organizations” which will serve to broaden the
diversity and geographic representation within the metro area. RTD, DRCOG and CDOT will continue to
have representation on the Mobility Choice Board.
Additionally, the proposed contribution from each of the public agencies, including RTD, has been
decreased to $400,000. Through discussions with public agency staff and Mobility Choice leadership,
and with careful consideration of the planned scope of work, it was determined that this level of funding
will still be satisfactory to achieve the goals and mission of the Study, albeit with less contingency
available. Private sector funding would be used for project administrative support, stakeholder
engagement and ongoing work following study completion.
Once the study is complete, the Blueprint, which includes a significant public involvement process,
would be used to recommend mobility options for RTD, CDOT and DRCOG intended to assure that the
agency’s investments are well-coordinated and aligned to support future technological and related
advances in transportation. The Blueprint recommendations would not be binding on any participating
agency and it will be at the RTD Board’s sole discretion to accept or pursue any of the plans or
recommendations contained within the report. The current plan is for the study to initiate in summer
2017, with completion in early 2018.
To date, CDOT and DRCOG have taken actions to secure their share of funding. DRCOG’s action is
contingent on all three public partners participating at like amounts in funding the technical study work.
RTD Board approval of this funding request will allow RTD to have an equal voice with our planning
partners in the oversight, direction and management of the Blueprint.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project in the amount of $400,000 is available from the District’s FY 2016/17 Board
Appropriated Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into
any and all agreements required to provide $400,000 in Regional Transportation District funding in

support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint. RTD’s funds are to be used for the technical consultant(s)
selected to conduct the study, in partnership with the Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT) and the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) as articulated in this Board
report.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not allocate $400,000 to the Mobility Choice Blueprint.
This action is not recommended as it would result in RTD not having a role in the study and could
run counter to RTD’s interests.

MOBILITY CHOICE SUMMARY

Who are the proposed partners?
The four proposed partners are RTD, DRCOG, CDOT and the non-profit Mobility Choice organization.
Mobility Choice is a program of the 501c3 Denver Metro Chamber Leadership Foundation. The
governing board of the Mobility Choice program is composed of large employers, tech-mobility
companies, regional economic organizations, retired local officials, and partnering public agencies.
How is the Blueprint effort funded?
Each of the four partners would allocate $400,000 to the Blueprint effort. DRCOG, CDOT and Mobility
Choice have already committed funding. All of the public agency funds would be directly used to hire
and pay a technical consultant to prepare the Blueprint document. CDOT would manage agency funding
and enter into the agreement with the technical consultant. No public funds will be used to support the
Mobility Choice organization.
What will the Mobility Choice organization provide?
With its funding contribution, the Mobility Choice organization will provide a staff person for the
Blueprint Project Management Team, additional public outreach and education, administration for the
technical effort and the Mobility Choice Board, and identification of potential pilot projects.
What type of technical consultant will prepare the Blueprint?
Consulting transportation companies have been contacted to provide information on how to approach
the Blueprint. Engineering, planning, and strategic transportation consulting firms will respond to a
request for proposal. Academic institutions may also respond as a project lead or as part of a technical
team.
How will the Blueprint be governed?
Each of the four partners would provide a staff person to a Project Management Team. The Project
Management Team will select the technical consultant and oversee preparation of the Blueprint. Each
Project Management Team member will report back to his/her respective agency management and
board.
What are the expected Blueprint outcomes?
The Blueprint will make recommendations for policies, programs and projects that will be affected by
emerging mobility technologies over the next 15 years. The 2004 voter-approved FasTracks plan will be
an input into the Blueprint. The Blueprint will focus on maximizing the investment in the region’s fixed
transit system, identifying new cost-effective approaches to mobility, and effectively connecting all
modes to create an integrated system.

service the District can afford to provide. (See attached power point presentation.)
In the early stages of the development of the SBP and annual Budget, staff looks to the Board for
guidance regarding key budget objectives and assumptions that are to be used in the generation of
the financial plans. This is to inform the Board that staff intends to use these existing guidelines
unless overriding instructions are received. Parameters currently considered in the preparation of the
District’s 2018-2023 SBP and 2018 Budget are:
(1) Fiscal management, including requirements to operate per specified performance goals and
to maintain a balanced budget
(2) Board-adopted strategic goals
(3) Continued development of fund balances, maintain adequate unrestricted fund balance
(4) Continued implementation of remaining Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations
as feasible
(5) Optimization of service levels for bus and light rail systems
(6) Fuel lock for budget certainty
(7) State of Good Repair (SOGR) of facilities and equipment
(8) Prioritization of capital and expense projects
(9) Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) renegotiated for 2018 forward
(10) Planned fleet expansion/replacement with use of Certificate of Participation (COP)
proceeds and internal cash flow when debt service coverage ratio allows
(11) Cost allocation to FasTracks lines/services based on resource drivers
(12) Annual service payment to DTO for operation of commuter rail
(13) Increase in operating and maintenance costs and reduction in construction expenditures
for FasTracks

Material uncontrollable variables which significantly impact RTD’s budgeting process and financial
planning can change, however. The following items will affect RTD in the development of the 20182023 SBP and 2018 Budget:
(1) Sales and use tax revenues
a. Current quarterly CU-Leeds School forecast (March 2017) for sales and use tax
indicates an increase in 2017 of 4.0% above 2016 collections (baseline forecast);
actual 2016 collections increased 4.1% over 2015
b. Forecast for 2018 is an increase of 5.5% over 2017 (baseline forecast)
c. March forecast for 2017 indicates a reduction of about $22 million in sales/use tax
revenue from the 2017 Budget (combined Base/FasTracks)
d. Actual sales and use tax ytd January 2017 increased 3.0% over same time prior
year
(2) Fuel costs
a. Diesel fuel is locked in 2017 at $1.69/gallon in 2017, down from a $2.23 lock
price in 2016
(3) Inflation rate/Consumer Price Index
a. Using Moody’s CPI forecasts that agree with FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation
(APE)
b. Denver/Boulder area: Moody’s CPI forecasts applied to operating and maintenance
costs/expense and capital project costs
2017: 2.7%
2018: 2.8%
2019: 3.1%
2020: 2.9%
2021: 2.7%
2022: 2.6%
2023: 2.6%
c. National: Moody’s CPI forecasts applied to fuel costs
2017: 2.8%
2018: 2.5%
2019: 3.0%
2020: 2.7%
2021: 2.4%
2022: 2.3%
2023: 2.2%
(4) Fare revenue increase
a. Overall system-wide fare revenue is budgeted to increase 15.5% in 2017
b. On the Base System, fare revenue is expected to remain flat in 2017; for
FasTracks, fare revenue is expected to increase $20.2 million over the 2016 budget
due to full-year operation of the FasTracks service corridors brought on-line in 2016
c. Fare revenue will be recalibrated with the 2017 Amended Budget and adjusted for
the timing of line openings
d. 2018 fare revenue increase will be established with development of the 2018
Budget
(5) Ridership
a. Overall system-wide ridership is budgeted to increase 6.8%; the assumption is that
all ridership growth will come from FasTracks as the Base System ridership
estimate for 2017 is flat

Packet Pg. 60

1.C.2

b. Ridership increase will be recalibrated in 2017 Amended Budget based on actual
ytd results
c. Actual results will serve as basis for the 2018 estimate
(6) Additional grant revenues as they become available within Board policy and RTD
objectives
(7) Economic conditions in Colorado and the District
CONCLUSION
Staff is seeking guidance on how to proceed with the guidelines and parameters identified to develop
a first draft of the SBP, which staff plans to present to the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee at the regular meeting on May 26. A further discussion of development of the SBP is
planned for the Board Study Session on April 25.

Non-Profit Program Update

Information

BACKGROUND
RTD’s Non-Profit Program has been in existence for more than 25 years. The purpose of the program is
to offer government agencies and nonprofit organizations the opportunity to purchase discounted RTD
fare media for distribution to their low income clients.
Last year the RTD Board approved several changes to the program including changing the name of the
program, offering the new Day Pass ticket books, changing all discounts to 50%, permitting agencies to
recover up to 100% of the price paid to RTD for the fare media, easing some of the administrative
burden, and raising the program face value amount from $5,800,000 to $6,800,000. We currently
have 302 agencies in the program. Of those, 57 are new participants that joined in 2016 and 17 are
new participants that joined in 2017.
DISCUSSION
With the changes made for 2016, we anticipated additional interest in the program. We knew we
needed to put some level of controls on the program while allowing additional participants to purchase
fares. We limited those that were already participating in the program to their previous year’s purchases
+ 10%. This allowed approximately $35,000 (face value) per month or $420,000 (face value) per year
for new participants. However, in December the volume of orders was so large, our manual tracking
process was not able to keep pace with the volume of orders as precisely as we had been able to up to
that point and we went over the approved amount by $700,000 (face value).
In just the first two months of 2017, we have had 10 new organizations join the program and with the
current sales from existing customers and the new ones, we could easily exceed the current board
authorized program total of $6,800,000 by mid-year.
In March, we approached the Board Executive Committee with a short-term measure so that we could
slow down the rate of buy in the program until we could bring a more permanent solution to the Board
for consideration. The following is the short-term plan.




Any new program applicant will be put on a wait list for now as well as any existing agency that
did not order in 2016
Current members (pre-2016) are limited to what they purchased last year for each month
For new members (2016 and 2017), we are averaging their total amount purchased last year and
limiting them to that amount

Packet Pg. 77

1.C.3

OPTIONS




Keep the program amount the same, which would result in a reduction from 2016 amounts
Increase the program by $730,000 face value
Increase the program by $1,000,000 face value

Keep the program amount the same
There is no room for new participants in the program at the current funding levels. We would need to
wait list those with interest in the program until someone dropped from the program. With current
participants we would most likely need to reduce what they received last year because we went over
the budget and would also need to allow room for those new participants that joined at the end of last
year or yearly in 2017.
Increase the program $730,000 face value
There would be no room for new participants in the program at this funding level. We would need to
wait list those with interest in the program until someone dropped from the program. We could offer
existing participants the same funding levels they received in 2016. Any new 2017 participants would
only receive what they have received to date. They would not be able to receive any additional for the
rest of the year.
Increase the program by $1,000,000 face value
There would be no room for new participants in the program at this funding level. We would still need
to wait list those with interest in the program until someone dropped from the program. We would be
able fund all of current participants at 2016 levels. We would also be able to increase funding for new
participants that joined in 2016 and 2017.

SmartCard Project Update

CFO/AGM,

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 11, 2017
Information

The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. in mid-2010.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 475,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
March 2017, 1.5M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the
public pilot program participants at the RTD retail outlets. As of January 4, 2016 approximately 1,950
cards were issued, of which 1,540 (79%) were full fare cards and 410 (21%) were discount cards.
The average stored value loaded (initial purchases and reloads) was $49, with a total value loaded of
$390,000. Customers took 118,000 trips using these MyRide cards with a fare payment value of
$330,000. Of these trips; 71% were local, 27% regional and 2% airport.
The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and
used much like a gift card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar
amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card at RTD
sales outlets.
All bus installations are complete for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as buses
are purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line, B Line to Westminster
and R Line to Aurora. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge. 191
Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.
As of January 1, 2017, Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc. separated its Business Process Services Unit into
an independent public company called Conduent. Xerox will be referred to as Conduent.
