Fleet Revenue and Non-Revenue Vehicles Review Internal Audit
Report Executive Summary
Background

Overall Summary/Highlights

In 2022, RTD contracted with RubinBrown LLP to serve as its Internal Audit provider to perform internal
audits and other consultative functions.

The audit team rated two audit observations as High Priority, six audit observations as
Moderate Priority, and three audit observation as Low/Process Improvement. As a
result, an overall report rating of ‘Needs Improvement’ was assigned.

This Fleet Revenue and Non-Revenue Vehicles review is a Board-approved Internal Audit Plan project.
RubinBrown LLP prepared the report for use by the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and RTD
management. Recommendations for improvement are presented for management’s consideration, and
management is responsible for the effective implementation of corrective action plans.

The report’s Internal Audit Observations and Recommendations section describes the
observations, recommendations, and RTD’s management responses to address each
audit observation. Management has committed to completing the agreed-upon action
plans.

Overall Rating

Objective and Scope

(See IA Report Appendices 2 and 3 for definitions)

The objectives of this review was to:
•

Determine whether policies and procedures for the district’s fleet revenue and non-revenue assets have
been established.

•

Determine whether RTD has a fleet management information system, which provides records of all
maintenance, repair, and service activity.

•

Determine whether the fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles’ preventive maintenance procedures
require fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles to be serviced periodically to stay compliant with Federal
and State mandated safety and emission requirements.

•

Determine whether the physical inventory of the fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles is conducted on
an annual basis to ensure the completeness and accuracy of RTD’s vehicles’ records.

•

Determine whether the additions and disposals of fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles are properly
supported, approved and recorded in the designated general ledger accounts in a timely manner.

•

Determine whether the general ledger accounts for fleet revenue and non-revenue are reconciled on a
periodic basis.

The scope consisted of reviewing the district fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles policies and procedures;
asset management planning; preventive maintenance; quality control; acquisition and disposals; and general
ledger accounts reconciliations for test period of January 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023.

Report Rating Definitions

Report ratings are utilized to communicate the aggregate compliance or risk observed for the in-scope location,
process, or system.

Satisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are generally in compliance with applicable policies and procedures. The design and
effectiveness of internal controls appear to be adequate. Exceptions noted were isolated and/or minor, and
departures from leading practices are minimal (as applicable).

Needs Improvement

The in-scope areas of the project, although generally in compliance with policies and procedures, have certain
deficiencies with the design or effectiveness of internal controls which should be improved. Some departures from
leading practices have been identified, creating opportunities for process or efficiency improvement or for improved
financial statement accuracy.

Unsatisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are in substantial non-compliance with policies and procedures, and the design or
effectiveness of internal controls is not adequate. Multiple and/or significant departures from leading practice may be
present, creating operational inefficiency. If such deficiencies are not corrected, the company can be exposed to loss
or financial misstatement.

Priority of Internal Audit Report Observations

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or
situations could occur which could have a significant adverse impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) to the business. Significant audit observations may include
conditions dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts of interest, and control weaknesses. In
addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control,
and/or exposure of data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an exposure of confidentiality or
integrity.

High Priority

Moderate Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following conditions:
• Significant financial impact for location/site audited
• Prevalence of issues or exceptions
• Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or regulatory requirements
• Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
• Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
• Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor, may be considered a high priority
classification.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.
Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial
statement errors and losses, operational inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues), or result in instances of policy and regulatory non-compliance as
well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and
Internal Audit.

Low Priority /
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to
improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next 12 months.

Internal Audit Observations and Recommendations
Observation 1
Observation Title:
Transit Asset Management Plan – Fleet Revenue and Non-Revenue Vehicles

Risk Rating:
High Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The review of the Transit Asset Management (TAM) plan indicated the following approved asset replacements for buses
and support vehicles for the periods of 2021-2027 and 2023-2028 did not match the purchases of 97 revenue vehicles
and zero non-revenue vehicles made by Bus Operations.
TAM Plan – 2021-2027
• FY2022
o Bus 40ft. – 28
o Bus 30ft. – 12
o Support Fleet – 39 Unleaded Fuel Vehicles (cars, trucks, vans) and one Diesel Fuel Vehicles (truck)
• FY2023
o Support Fleet – 12 Unleaded Fuel Vehicles (cars, trucks, vans) and three Diesel Fuel Vehicles (truck)
o No replacements for light rail vehicles
TAM Plan – 2023-2028
• FY 2023
o Bus 40 ft. – 98
o Bus 30 ft. – 37
o Support Fleet – No replacements
Additionally, the Fact Sheets, which supplement the TAM Plan replacement and renewal information with details
regarding project description, cost, and timeline/deliverability, did not consistently include detail information deemed to
be relevant for making asset replacements decisions.
Cause:
The purchases of assets are based on ad hoc decisions that are driven by anticipated federal and local funding programs.
Risks:
Failure to align asset procurement to the TAM Plan could increase the risk that insufficient funds are available for required
replacements and misalignment with the authorized TAM Plan.
Lack of relevant information on the Fact Sheets could result in inappropriate funding prioritization.
Recommendation:
Management should require the procurement of fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles be based on the approved
TAM Plan to ensure alignment with agency’s capital asset strategies and goals.
Management should require that the Fact Sheets contain all relevant information at a level of detail sufficient to ensure
the complete evaluation of investment requests.

The bus purchase that occurred during this period was a result of active bus replacement to address a very old fleet and
service specific needs that were already in process prior to the pandemic. RTD Bus Maintenance has since worked in
conjunction with Asset Management to align the bus replacement schedule with the TAM Plan and the asset authorization
memorandum. Any future deviations from the TAM Plan will be coordinated and documented with the asset management
group well in advance of any bus purchases.

Observation 2
Observation Title:
Asset Data Collection and Analysis – Fleet Revenue and Non-Revenue Vehicles

Risk Rating:
High Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
It was noted that an agency-wide data-driven approach that relies on extensive asset-level data on condition, age, and
mileage was not utilized in developing the current TAM Plan, including investment prioritization, performance targets,
condition assessment, and preventive maintenance. RTD has not developed and implemented agency-wide
methodologies for collecting data from the numerous sources maintaining the inventory records for revenue and
non-revenue vehicles as well as analyzing that data for decision making.
The agency does not appear to be conducting consistent data collection and analysis. There was a general lack in
proficiency in terms of generating reports from the Trapeze Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) system, resulting in a
low level of confidence in the data.
Cause:
This was due to the lack of an agency-wide data management policy and procedures.
Risks:
Lack of a data-driven decision could increase the risk of misalignment with the agency’s business objectives and goals.
Recommendation:
Management should establish an agency-wide data management policy and procedures that outlines the types of data
needed, data sources, data collection protocols, data storage and management, data analysis, and use.
Management should consider training staff with the skills and knowledge to conduct data collection and analysis and to
present data in formats tailored to the business needs of the different functional units.
Management Action Plan:
The Asset Management Accountability Team (AMAT) will use the Asset Information Maturity Plan recently developed. This
audit observation closely mirrors a gap assessment completed in Q3 of 2023 by AMCL LLC consulting. RTD has begun to
implement the Asset Information Maturity Plan to address the observations, risks and recommendations identified in this
audit.
Central to this action plan is the development of asset class and asset information strategies combined with creation of
condition assessment methodologies capable of accurately forecasting performance. This task, demanding significant
resources, involves consolidating data from departmental records outside traditional systems. It’s a strategic move aimed
at evaluating the agency’s revenue vehicles against its TAM Plan’s criteria-cost, performance, risk, and equity.
Acknowledging the complexity and resource intensity of this initiative, staff are committed to a realistic timeline, ensuring
agency-wide engagement not limited only to Bus or Rail Operations. This comprehensive approach underscores the
commitment to leveraging data-driven insights for strategic decision-making, ultimately enhancing the performance and
system reliability.

Observation 3
Observation Title:
Asset Management Procedures – Revenue and Non-Revenue Vehicles

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
RTD has established the Asset Management and Asset Renewal policies that focus on commitment to asset management
practice and accountability. However, the agency has not developed standard operating procedures for key elements of
the revenue and non-revenue management process including inventory information (including for spare parts), schedules
for inspections/preventive maintenance activities, condition assessment, performance measures/targets, fleet
management plan, fleet replacement, and overhaul strategies.
Additionally, several functional teams from across the agency are involved in RTD’s revenue and non-revenue vehicles
management activities. However, a procedure manual outlining the tasks of each of the functional unit and
communication protocols for project handover has not been established.
Cause:
This is due to a lack of standard operating procedures and ineffective communication across the agency.
Risks:
Failure to establish standard operating procedures and communication increases the risk of misalignment to the agency’s
business objectives and strategies.
Recommendation:
Management should consider developing standard operating procedures that outline the different activities of the fleet
revenue and non-revenue vehicles management process and clearly define individual roles and responsibilities of each of
the functional units involved in asset management.
Management should establish clear lines of communication to facilitate the project handover, to promote a collaborative
culture amongst the functional units and to improve transparency of the project status.
Management Action Plan:
RTD staff guided by the Asset Management Accountability Team (AMAT) will focus on developing a data-driven
management strategy for revenue and non-revenue vehicles. It requires substantial investment to analyze the predictive
validity of condition assessments, which will inform key decision-making factors such as performance, cost, and risk. The
plan calls for the modification of existing assessment methodologies and the development of key metrics that are
currently undefined. Establishing performance criteria is a prerequisite for analyzing the relationship between condition
and performance. The plan also necessitates replacing the current inventory management system to overcome its
limitations and conducting a complete physical inventory of support fleet parts, which may require facility modifications
for secure storage. Given the complexities involved, especially considering Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system
considerations, a target deadline of December 2026 is seen as optimistic. However, the initiation of strategies, standard
operating procedures, and evolution of other aspects will start immediately. This detailed and structured approach
indicates a significant commitment to addressing the audit findings and improving vehicle management processes.

Observation 4
Observation Title:
Asset Management System – Fleet Revenue and Non-Revenue Vehicles

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Currently, fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicle inventory and condition information is maintained in Trapeze EAM,
Enterprise Data Warehouse, Oracle Fixed Financial Assets, Mid-Term Financial Plan, and departmental records. The
following was noted:

•
•

A system of record for RTD’s inventory information has not been established.
There was no mechanism to reconcile the inventory information maintained in the different systems to ensure the
completeness and accuracy of the inventory information.

Cause:
Different divisions have implemented their own record management procedures for vehicle and non-vehicle inventory,
resulting in multiple isolated repositories.
Risks:
Failure to establish a system of record for the fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles could lead to duplication of asset
information between different systems.
Failure to reconcile the fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles inventory could increase the risk of inaccurate inventory
information.
Recommendation:
Management should consider establishing the primary system of record for storing the fleet revenue and non-revenue
vehicles financial and operational data.
Management should consider reconciling the fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles inventory information between the
different systems to ensure accurate inventory information.
Management Action Plan:
Agreed this is a good practice, however, it should be noted that the Financial System (Oracle) information details will be
different from the TAM Plan. A high-level reconciliation between the two systems can be accomplished for basic
information such as vehicle counts. The plan emphasizes the utilization of the data warehouse to serve as a centralized
repository for curated information, drawing from existing systems to meet broader business objectives.
Given the complexity of harmonizing records across various functions and the significant coordination needed, staff
acknowledges the substantial time and resources required for this endeavor. This effort is pivotal for enhancing inventory
accuracy and efficiency. This timeline accounts for the shared resources with observations 2 and 3, highlighting the
interconnected nature of these initiatives and the strategic planning involved in addressing these audit findings
comprehensively.

Observation 5
Observation Title:
Preventive Maintenance Plan

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The review of the preventive maintenance inspections of the selected sample of fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles
disclosed the following:
Revenue Vehicles – Buses
•
•

Eight out of the selected sample of 36 buses had preventive maintenance inspections that were not within +/-10% of
the 6,000-mile interval.
Five buses were placed in the inactive contingency fleet with miles ranging from 597,594 to 713,015. The policy
states that buses are to be placed in inactive contingency at 500,000 miles.

Revenue Vehicles – Light Rail Vehicles (LRV)
•

15 out of the selected sample 35 LRV had preventive maintenance inspections after the target mileage interval for
the specific preventive maintenance inspection.

Non-Revenue – Support Fleet
•
•
•

Two out of the selected sample of 25 vehicles had preventive maintenance inspections that were not within +/-10%
of the 6,000-mile interval.
Two out of the selected sample of 25 vehicles had preventive maintenance inspections before their due date.
The Non-Vehicles Fleet Preventive Maintenance Plan states preventive maintenance is to be scheduled within +/-10%
of 6,000 miles but the current practice is to schedule preventive maintenance with+/-10% of 6,000 miles or
6 months, whichever comes first.

In addition, evidence of the quality control of the preventive maintenance was not documented.
Furthermore, there was no evidence that the manufacturer’s preventive maintenance recommendations were
incorporated in the preventative maintenance procedures for revenue and non-revenue vehicles.
Cause:
This was due to incorrect preventive maintenance schedules; lack of quality control staff and the manufacturers’
preventive maintenance procedure recommendations being omitted from the agency’s preventive maintenance of
revenue vehicles.
Risks:
Failure to conduct preventive inspections based on scheduled intervals could increase the risk of inefficiencies in staff
resource utilization and contribute to increased mechanical breakdowns.
Failure to conduct quality control on the work orders evidencing the completed preventive maintenance increases the risk
of improper preventive maintenance inspections.
Failure to incorporate the manufacturers’ preventive maintenance recommendations could increase the risk of improper
preventive maintenance inspections.

Internal Audit Report
Issued: March 20, 2024

Observation 5
Recommendation:
To improve the preventive maintenance, management should enforce the following:
•
•
•

Preventive maintenance inspections follow the intervals specified in the preventive maintenance plans for fleet
revenue and non-revenue vehicles.
Conduct quality control on a spot-check basis of the work orders evidencing the completed preventive maintenance.
Incorporate the manufacturers’ preventive maintenance requirements in the agency’s preventive maintenance of the
fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles.

Management Action Plan:
Bus Operations:
Bus Maintenance deviated from the Preventative Maintenance (PM) plan by conducting PMs early due to new
maintenance criteria being added to the PM list. RTD kept vehicles in service past 500,000 miles as a result of the
pandemic and the FTA’s requirement that RTD not replace vehicles while above the 20% spare ratio. Bus Maintenance
Engineering Team provides PM intervals based off manufacturers recommendations. Quality Control Inspectors conduct
routine post PM checks on vehicles which include new vehicle inspection (post-delivery inspection), onsite inspections,
diagnostic support training, accident investigations and vehicle retirement evaluations.
Any oversights identified in this observation will be addressed via process improvements and any future deviations from
the preventive maintenance plan will be noted and documented in the RTD system of record.
Rail Operations:
LRV Supervisors will be required to manage workload and workforce to ensure preventive maintenance inspections are
performed within the established mileage intervals specified in the LRV Preventive Maintenance Inspection Procedure and
Intervals.

Observation 6
Observation Title:
Fleet Non-Revenue Vehicles Assignment

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The annual fleet non-revenue and personal authorization form must be completed by the requestor and approved by their
Assistant General Manager or Chief before being assigned a non-revenue vehicle. The review of the 25 selected sample of
non-revenue vehicles assigned to RTD’s employees during the test period disclosed the following:
•
•

The annual fleet non-revenue and personal authorization form evidencing approval by the employee’s Assistant
General Managers/Chief could not be located for 17 non-revenue vehicles assignment.
The non-revenue vehicle take-home assignment and commuting authorization form evidencing approval by the
appropriate agency’s leadership for the two take-home assignments could not be located.

Cause:
This was due to a lack of a central repository for the authorization forms for fleet non-revenue vehicle assignments.
Risks:
Lack of evidence of proper approvals could result in misappropriation of the agency’s fleet non-revenue vehicles.
Recommendation:
Management should provide guidelines to the divisions for maintaining evidence of the authorization forms evidencing the
approval authorization by the appropriate management.
Management Action Plan:
Management will review the current vehicle assignment practices and the necessary approval documentation to ascertain
what amendments, if any, to the non-revenue vehicle procedure are required. Further, Human Resources, will design and
implement a non-revenue vehicle access and reporting framework that will more clearly define and detail the roles and
responsibilities related to ensure appropriate tracking and reporting of the required approvals.

Observation 7
Observation Title:
Condition Assessment -NDITION ASSESSMENT

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
It was noted that the useful life benchmark for buses of 14 years defined by the Federal Transit Administration is used for
bus service replacement. The agency routinely exceeds this useful life benchmark bus replacement by 2 to 3 years.
However, the useful life benchmark of 12 years is used for the depreciation of buses.
Cause:
The fleet revenue vehicle replacement and depreciation processes are handled by two different functional units.
Risks:
Failure to utilize a consistent useful life benchmark could increase the risk of incorrect fleet revenue vehicle inventory and
noncompliance with the Federal Transit Administration’s service-life policy.
Recommendation:
Management should consider using a consistent useful life benchmark for fleet revenue vehicles to ensure the accuracy of
the fleet revenue vehicles inventory and to meet the Federal Transit Administration funding eligibility guidelines.
Management Action Plan:
RTD will continue to have differences between the financial depreciation of assets vs. useful life benchmarks in the
Transit Asset Management Plan. This occurs because the financial records must adhere to Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles for consistency in recognizing the book value of assets, however the assets in the TAM Plan will have useful life
benchmarks and replacement activities occur based on condition assessments which can differ even within a group of
assets. RTD will enact a more robust reconciliation process, however, to identify any differences between depreciation
and useful life benchmarks for asset classes and will improve the reconciliation between Oracle records and the TAM Plan
where consistencies can be monitored such as counts of certain assets.

Observation 8
Observation Title:
Spare Vehicles Ratio

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
It was noted that a spare ratio policy and responsibility for the spare ratio calculation and monitoring has not been
established. Spare ratio, a requirement by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), is defined as the total number of
spare vehicles available for fixed route service divided by the total number of fixed route vehicles required for annual
maximum service.
RTD’s spare ratio was above the 20% spare ratio mandated by the FTA. Effective October 2023, RTD was granted an
approval to deviate from the 20% Spare Ratio Policy by the FTA. However, the bus replacements of 142, which resulted
in a total bus fleet of 1,026 in 2023, could contribute to RTD not being able to reduce the bus fleet size in a strategical
manner that would allow the agency to follow the FTA-recommended spare ratio.
Cause:
This is due the lack of responsibility and accountability for the spare ratio.
Risks:
Failure to consistently maintain the 20% spare ratio mandated by the FTA could increase the risk of the agency having
excess buses that require additional resources and can adversely affect the overall efficiency of the revenue vehicle fleet.
Recommendation:
Management should consider establishing a division that is responsible for the agency’s spare ratio policy and procedures.
Management Action Plan:
During the pandemic the FTA provided approval to RTD to operate with a higher spare ratio due to unprecedented
service reductions. RTD has since corresponded with the FTA regarding a fleet reduction plan to appropriately align with
the required 20% spare ratio by 2027. The bus purchase that occurred during this period was a result of active bus
replacement to address a very old fleet and service specific needs that were already in process prior to the pandemic.

Observation 9
Observation Title:
Fleet Revenue and Non-Revenue Vehicles Disposal

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
The review of the asset disposal process disclosed the following:
•
•

One fleet non-revenue vehicle was retired in August 2022 even though the insurance settlement was finalized in
December 2021, thus resulting in a significant delay in the disposal of the asset.
One out of a sample of four disposed fleet non-revenue vehicles was not included on the authorization for disposal
memo.

Cause:
This was due to oversight by Bus Operations in submitting the authorization for disposal memo to Accounting.
Risks:
Failure to document retired fleet non-revenue vehicles on the authorization for disposal memo and to submit the memo
to the Property and Grants Accounting for disposal in a timely manner could increase the risk of incorrect fleet
non-revenue vehicles inventory.
Recommendation:
Management should enforce the proper completion and timely submission of the authorization for disposal memo to
ensure fleet non-revenue vehicles are disposed of correctly.
Management Action Plan:
The two vehicles noted in this observation were an administrative anomaly in the disposal process. Processes have been
implemented between Bus Maintenance and Inventory Control System (ICS) to ensure the proper completion and timely
submission of the authorization for disposal memo to ensure fleet non-revenue vehicles are disposed of correctly.

Observation 10
Observation Title:
Fixed Asset Account Reconciliation

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
It was noted that the fixed asset reconciliation is performed on an annual basis. Additionally, there was no evidence of
review and approval of the annual fixed asset reconciliation dated December 2022.
Cause:
Agency policies and procedures were not consistently enforced.
Risks:
Lack of review and approval of the fixed asset reconciliation could increase the risk of improprieties in the fixed asset
balances reported in the general ledger.
Recommendation:
Management should consider conducting the fixed asset annual reconciliation on a quarterly basis to ensure errors are
investigated and resolved in a timely manner.
Management should require the review and approval of the annual fixed asset reconciliation to ensure accurate reporting
of the fixed asset balance.
Management Action Plan:
A reconciliation comparing the general ledger balance to the sub-ledger balances found on the “Account Recon Reserve”
report will be completed quarterly by the Projects and Grants Division and reviewed and approved by the Senior Manager
of Accounting.

Observation 11
Observation Title:
Performance Measures

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
It was noted that the agency uses asset age to determine the renewal and replacement of the fleet revenue and
non-revenue vehicles as well as their performance. The agency has not developed measures including cost, performance,
equity, utilization, and risks measures as inputs in the decision support tools and investment prioritization process.
Cause:
This was due to the agency managing its fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles based on age.
Risks:
Lack of adequate performance measures could increase the risk of poor investment decisions and strains on the capital
budget.
Recommendation:
Management should consider developing adequate performance measures to enhance the condition and performance of
the agency’s fleet revenue and non-revenue vehicles fleet.
Management Action Plan:
Bus Maintenance reviews revenue vehicle needs annually and may adjust vehicle purchases or retirements based on the
operational needs of the agency. Revenue and non-revenue vehicle needs are determined in conjunction with the
Superintendent of Maintenance; AGM of Bus Operations; the Asset Management Accountability Team and the General
Manager and CEO via the TAM Plan process. Bus Operations will continue to work with relevant RTD groups to determine
the appropriate metrics to utilize in determining the replacement of vehicles.

Appendix 3: Priority of Observation Ratings

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business
success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or situations could occur which could have a significant adverse
impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) on the business. Significant audit observations may include conditions
dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts
of interest, and control weaknesses. In addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates
a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control, and/or exposure of
data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an
exposure of confidentiality or integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following
conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant financial impact for location/site audited
Prevalence of issues or exceptions
Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or
regulatory requirements
Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor,
may be considered a high priority classification.

Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed
reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate
Priority

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key
business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial statement errors and losses, operational
inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues) or result in instances of policy and regulatory
non-compliance as well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time
period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Low Priority/
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings were identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for
business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or
are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact on the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next
12 months.
