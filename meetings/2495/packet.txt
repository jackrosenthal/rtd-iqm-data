DISCUSSION
RTD’s legacy union payroll time tracking (Hardware and Software) system, is well over ten-years old and
has passed its end-of-life. Because of its age and functionality, this system presents a range of
continued challenges to RTD and requires replacement.
The current vendor was given a sole source to upgrade their existing system to a cloud based system.
However, this system was found to require a significant amount of customization that would increase
the life-cycle cost and add complexity to ongoing operations. This contract was terminated and is
currently in close-out negotiations. We have concluded that it is in the best interest of RTD to enter into
a new procurement for this project.
Information Technology has taken remediation steps that mitigate some of the major operational risks,
but it is inevitable the system will need to be replaced and as quickly as possible. The original set of
requirements have been enhanced and updated, and a new procurement is now ready to advance using
available Cooperative Purchasing Agreements. The Cooperative Purchasing Agreement should expedite
the procurement process and it will start this month (July).
Upon completion of the procurement, implementation time of a new Union Time Clock / Payroll system
is expected to be between six (6) and twelve (12) months. The specific implementation period of
performance is dependent on the selected vendor’s implementation plan.

Information

The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips. These cards can be loaded with certain
dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or
rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto
the card at RTD retail outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the public pilot program
participants at the RTD retail outlets. For the first twenty-five weeks and as of June 26th, a total of
1,870 cards were issued of which 1,480 (79%) were full fare and 370 (21%) were discount cards.
The average initial stored value loading is $44.59with a total value loaded including reloads of
$190,400. There have been 59,860 boardings using these MyRide cards with fare payment value of
$130,700 Of these boardings; 69% were local, 29% regional and 2% airport.

SALARIED POSITION CHANGES AUDIT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT #15-01-01

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

The increase in salaries increases the overall staff cost for RTD and affects future retirement
costs for the district. Cost increases for Position Changes have not normally been included in the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). Position Changes have been requested as early as one month
after the SBP was approved by the Board of Directors.
SCOPE
This audit concentrated on the period from January 2012 to October 2015. It included all position
changes requested within the period that resulted in increased salary costs.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:
 Ensure there were policies and procedures covering all types of position changes.
 Determine the extent of position changes and reorganization requests.
 Review justification for the requests.
 Ensure consistency in application of policies and procedures.
 Ensure appropriate documentation is maintained.
 Ensure appropriate level of internal controls to prevent inappropriate position changes.
CONCLUSION
The frequency of requests for position changes has been very significant. There is no evidence
of consistency in the way positions are evaluated. Documentation relating to position changes
that are included in employees’ files, does not, in the majority of cases, provide evidence of the
justification for the change or the salary increase. Employees’ files do not contain all information
normally required.
In the interest of RTD, Audit recommends contracting with an independent organization to
conduct a complete classification study for all salaried positions. Policies and procedures should
be included in the Policy Manual that contains sufficient internal controls to prevent any blatant or
perceived preferential treatment associated with re-organizations or position changes and ensure
that position changes are not used to reward staff for longevity.

Attachment: FAACJuly 2016 with attachments (2853 : Quarterly Audit Update)

There were approximately 133 position changes that resulted in salary increases from 2012 to
2015. The change in salary costs as a result of the position changes was in excess of $3 million.
The frequency of the requests caused Human Resources (HR) to dedicate most of one
manager’s time to processing the requests.

CURRENT STATUS

Attachment: FAACJuly 2016 with attachments (2853 : Quarterly Audit Update)

SLT is in the process of developing new/updated Policies and Procedures. Management
agrees that the reasons for position changes could be better defined and consolidated and it is
being reviewed as part of the new policies and procedures. There has been a decrease in the
number of Position Changes throughout RTD.

SALARY INCREASES AUDIT
HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT #15-01-02

RTD has two types of annual increases that are paid to salaried employees – progression
increases and results based increases. According to RTD’s Compensation Manual:
 Progression increases are used to move employees through their pay grade on an
accelerated basis.
 Results Based increases are a result of the performance evaluation and rewards
employees for their job performance.
The following table shows the salary increases from 2012 to 2015:
Year

SCOPE
The scope of the audit included all types of salary increases from 2012 to 2015.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:



Determine whether there were policies and procedures for salary increases, they
contained sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized salary increases and they
were being applied as prescribed.
Ensure that salary increases were duly authorized and approved.
CONCLUSION

The Guidelines relating to salary increases were vague making it difficult to identify the process
and procedures and determine whether or not they were being followed.
RTD needs policies and procedures rather than guidelines that contain sufficient internal
controls to prevent fraud, loss, misuse and abuse. In addition, the policies and procedures need
to ensure accountability, consistency and proper segregation of duties.
CURRENT STATUS
Management is drafting new/improved policies and procedures. Management will consider a
compensation review by an independent organization as budget permits.

Cost Certainty/Risk Transfer
Under the Concession Agreement, capital from the Concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), is at risk for
project construction and operations:
2011-2017
•

DTP will receive lump sum payments from RTD during construction for the majority of costs and
bears responsibility for raising capital (Private Activity Bonds and Equity) for the remainder of costs

2017-2044
•

DTP will receive annual TABOR payments (secured by voter-approved limits and sales and use tax
collections) from RTD for Private Activity Bond (PAB) repayment. These annual payments are fixed
(non-indexed to inflation) based on an amortization schedule.

2016-2044
•

DTP will receive monthly service availability payments from RTD for operations and maintenance
– Base service availability payments by year are known and are adjusted each year for inflation
(CPI, Labor and Materials indexes). Each of the three rail segments has it’s own service
availability payment calculation.
– Payments are adjusted according to performance criteria, such as on-time performance, fleet
availability, and cleanliness. Could be a bonus or deduction.
– RTD retains flexibility over the service availability payment when using the change order
process to adjust service levels
