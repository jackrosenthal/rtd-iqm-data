Subject:

Approval of Contactless Card Contract for
SmartCard

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to execute a contract with Giesecke
& Devrient to provide contactless smart cards (Contract 13DH023). This award is for a three-year
contract followed by two one-year options. The award amount is not-to-exceed two million dollars
($2,000,000.00).
BACKGROUND
When RTD selected the SmartCard program vendor, ACS/Xerox, it was determined that some system
and program components should be acquired through a separate competitive procurement process. The
contactless SmartCards (SmartCard media) are a major element of the SmartCard program and are
available in the open market to purchase for distribution from RTD to SmartCard users.
DISCUSSION
On July 15, 2013, RTD issued a request for proposal to acquire contactless SmartCards to provide the
card inventory to maintain the existing EcoPass and CollegePass programs and in preparation for 2014’s
MyRide fare program. The selected vendor is to provide the cards configured to work with the Xerox
system and address the necessary security provisions. On August 15th, five proposals were received:
ABnote, ASK-Int-TAG, EDM, Giesecke & Devrient and Multicard. Giesecke & Devrient was selected out
of five firms in this open-competition. Giesecke & Devrient’s proposal demonstrated a strong and
experienced team in the transportation industry and Xerox will be required to certify that the cards work
on RTD’s system. Their proposal demonstrated a low cost and a thorough understanding of the card
requirements along with comprehensive security procedures. The selection criteria for this requisition
were: Cost 60%, Experience with Transit Smart Media Production and Compliance with Specifications
25%, Strength of Security Procedures 10% and Previous Experience with Xerox / ACS 5%. Giesecke &
Devrient also had high recommendations from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).
Based on RTD’s estimated card usage, RTD anticipates the average cost per card to be $1.05. Cards
will be used over a five year period.
This contract provides the necessary card inventory to maintain the normal operations of the EcoPass
and CollegePass programs and preparation for next year’s MyRide implementation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to RTD for the contract period, is set at two million dollars ($2,000,000.00). Individual orders will
be placed to provide necessary card inventory as needed by RTD on a just-in-time basis. Sufficient
funding has been included in the 2014 expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the three year contract (Contract 13DH023) with two one-year options with Giesecke &
Devrient with a not-to-exceed value of two million dollars ($2,000,000). This action provides card
inventory to maintain and expand the RTD SmartCard initiative.

2. Do not approve the contract. This is not the recommended action because the functioning of the
SmartCard system requires the availability of adequate contactless card stock for customers.
3. Require staff to issue a new RFP.

2014 Salaried Benefit Plans

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the 2014 Plan Year Salaried Insured Benefits Budget and authorize the CEO/General Manager to
enter into an agreement with the Insurance Carriers.
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Insured Benefits program for approval to the
Board of Directors. Approval of the program by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and
provides costs for the 2014 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins October 20,
2013, and closes November 2, 2013.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2014 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2014 Budget, 2) Continued focus on containing
cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market competitiveness,
and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Health Care Reform
provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the modest changes for the 2014 plan year.
Medical
-

-

Cigna administers two self-funded plans on behalf of RTD. Both the PPO (Preferred Provider
Organization) Plan and the HDHP (High Deductible Health Plan) Plan have a specific individual
$150,000 stop-loss ceiling in 2014. The administrative cost will increase by 0.1% in 2014. The
Cigna Plans are expected to have approximately 460 employees enrolled. 2013 claims are running
14.3% below expected claims YTD, and 2014 claims are not projected to be higher than 2013
levels.
Kaiser provides 3 Plan Options: a fully insured HMO (Health Maintenance Organization); a DHMO
(HMO Plan with deductibles), and an HDHP. The Kaiser plans are expected to have approximately
200 employees enrolled. This plan has proposed a 3.5% blended increase over 2013.

Dental
-

No carrier/plan changes and no fixed cost increase. Delta is a self-funded plan, and has projected a
5% increase in expected claims exposure. Administrative fees are in a rate guarantee period until
2015 renewal.

Life & Disability
-

The rate guarantee with Lincoln National expired. Our renewal resulted in a 12.5% increase on our

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

life insurance rates. Rates for Short Term Disability, Long Term Disability, Accidental Death &
Dismemberment, and Voluntary Insurance products had no increase in premium rates.

Vision/Business Travel Accident
-

Vision Plan is currently a fully insured plan with Anthem Blue Cross – Blue Shield, and is in rate
guarantee until the 2015 Plan renewal. There are no carrier/plan changes and no costs increase
with the Business Travel Accident Plan.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2014 planned Salaried Employee Insured Benefit budget is projected to be a 2.9% increase over
2013 projected benefit costs. The success in cost containment is largely due to the 2010
implementation of the Cigna self-funded options and implementation of the HDHP (High Deductible
Health Plan) options in both Cigna and Kaiser. Although medical trend increases for employer-sponsored
group plans for 2014 are projected to be 10%, RTD has effectively managed to keep the salaried benefit
plan increases lower.
The major cost impacts in 2014 are due to Kaiser Premium increases of 3.5%. The net additional benefit
costs anticipated in 2013 are essentially flat. This is the fourth year we have achieved strong cost
containment as a result of our shift in carriers, plan offerings, plan design and funding models.
The 2013 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $9,360,797. The projected increase of
2.9% results in an increase of $271,463 or a total projected cost of $9,632,260 in 2014. The increase
meets the projected costs in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). RTD’s benefit costs are below the average
for Metro area companies, which are experiencing 6-15% cost increases according to the Denver
Chamber of Commerce.
ALTERNATIVES
1.

2.

3.

It is recommended that the Financial Administration and Audit Committee recommend to the full
RTD Board of Directors that the 2014 Salaried Employee Insured Benefit Plan recommendations
be approved.
Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2014. This is not
recommended since it would require significant additional negotiations with benefit providers and
delay the employee enrollment period.
Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plan. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit plans
to the salaried employees.

Subject:

Proposed 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accepts the modifications to the 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for the upcoming fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step
in development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in February 2013
for the 2013 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to the establishment of the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA) fund and to update the Policy with the most recent rating agency
credit ratings.
DISCUSSION
The current Policy includes the phrase “The Board of Directors will review potential fare increases
annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)”. In order to update the
Policy with the current practice of including fare increases in the SBP every three years to account
for inflation, this phrase has been modified as shown in the attached 2014 Proposed Fiscal Policy
Statement.
In addition, the Fund Balance Policy #6 referencing a fund to capture excess Denver Union Station
(DUS) revenue to be used for future DUS development has been removed from the Policy since the
funding for its development has been identified and development is scheduled to be completed in
2014.
All other proposed Policy policies changes are primarily wording clarification and are reflected in the
attachment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Changing the policy as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2014 Recommended
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports
this alternative because the changes document the policies to be adhered to in 2014 and
provide clarification of certain phrases.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies and
welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the recommended changes to RTD’s 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not
recommended because RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language
and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every 3 years in the mid and long-term budgets to
adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors maywill considerreview potential fare
adjustmentsincreases annually at the time of the development of the Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP). As part of this process, staff will review potential fare
increases to establish a fare structure with due consideration for:
 consistency and equity throughout RTD;
 ease of use and simplicity;
 maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues;
 acceptability and marketability of fare structure to customers and the general
public; and
 verification and enforceability of fare payment compliance.
2. Fare policies willshould take into account the special needs of transit dependent,
elderly, youth, student, handicapped, and commuter patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. Staff will identify on an annual basis excess property and equipment, and will
make an ongoing attempt to sell such excess property and equipment to enhance
cash flow.

INVESTMENT POLICIES
Attachment: 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement (1717 : Proposed 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement)

1. RTD will review its investment policy annually with the Board to ensure
consistency with the following objectives (in order of priority):
 safety of invested funds;
 maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs; and
 attainment of the maximum yield possible consistent with the first two
objectives
2. RTD will review its investment performance on a quarterly basis with the Board.

EXPENDITURE POLICIES
1. RTD will endeavor to achieve service levels that will make the transit system easier
to use, improve travel times, and be more effective.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will maintain all assets at a level that protects capital investment and
minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against
loss and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels and

2

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.3.a

operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital
projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); and
 consequences of not funding; and
 RTD mission statement elements.
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see 7.).

3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for
the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If
the cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be
brought to the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future
technological changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the
public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital
improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the
FasTracks capital and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring
nature or to meet unexpected increases in costs. This unrestricted fund balance
3

Packet Pg. 12

1.B.3.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 223, 20143

Attachment: 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement (1717 : Proposed 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement)

will be comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund and an
undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base System, the
total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal
to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For
FasTracks, the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to two months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding
depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund
balance replenishment. For example, RTD may define the revenue sources that
would typically be looked to for replenishment of fund balance to include nonrecurring revenues and budget surpluses. Year-end surpluses are an especially
appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as severe economic downturns. With
Board approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce
the need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade
bond rating. The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement fund
on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled major
vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of replenishment of this
fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at
each year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to
unanticipated events.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado
Constitution.
6. RTD will maintain all revenues in excess of expenditures for Denver Union Station
in a reserve for future development of Denver Union Station as a rapid transit hub,
as specified in the intergovernmental agreement as amended on April 20, 2004.
7. The Board shall establish three reserves for future construction under the
FasTracks plan:





The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a level of $30
million each year. These funds will be available to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost savings
opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not
be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Bbase Ssystem capital or operating
activity.
The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding for
future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from the FISA
will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project goals identified
in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be provided from the
sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other sources approved by the
Board.
All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a
reserve for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be
used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, or Certificates of
Participation (COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not
to exceed the expected useful life of the asset.
2. Effective communication with creditbond rating agencies will be maintained, and a
policy of full disclosure on every financial report and official statementbond
prospectus will be followed.
3. Before bonded long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures will be analyzed.
4. DebtBond financing or COPs will not be issued to support current operating
expenditures.
It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's creditbond ratings at the highest reasonably attainable
level in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to
receive lower interest rates and lower debtbond or certificate insurance premiums
than would be possible with lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed

Board Meeting Date: October 15, 2013

Subject:

Certification of the 2014 Contribution for the
RTD Salaried Employees' Retirement Plans

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
certifies a 2014 contribution to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB
Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement, at the actuarial recommended amount of
$3.1 million. It is also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors certifies a 2014 contribution to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan Trust (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified
amount to the plan for each year of employment, at a rate of 9% of each participant’s eligible
compensation.
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. In 2013, the Board amended
the contribution to the DB Plan to a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million based on actuarial
recommendations. Previously, the DB Plan had been funded on a percentage of salaries basis. In
addition, the Board approved a contribution rate of 9% of salaries for participants in the DC Plan in
2013.
DISCUSSION
The recommended fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the DB Plan was determined by the plan’s
actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a “fully funded” status for the plan. The
Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan would be made at
fixed annual amounts of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a result of the Actuary’s
recommendations.
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7-9% per year for participants. The
contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2013.

The assumed contributions indicate the different amounts that would be required to fund the plan at
9%, 8% and 7% of eligible salaries in 2014.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors certifies a 2014 contribution to RTD’s Salaried
Employees’ Pension Trust at the actuarial recommended amount of $3.1 million and Salaried
Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan Trust rate at 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation.
2. Certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Trust and the RTD
Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan Trust at amounts other than $3.1 million and 9%
respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pensions. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Subject:

2014 Budget Update

BACKGROUND
The State of Colorado requires that a requested budget be presented to the Board and be made
available for public inspection after giving public notice in newspapers of major distribution by
October 15th of each year. RTD’s 2014 Requested Budget was presented at the Board Study
Session on September 24, 2013. Public notice will be given in the October 12-13, 2013 weekend
editions of The Denver Post and The Boulder Daily Camera. Copies of the 2014 Requested Budget
will also be made available at that time in the Board office for public inspection.
The purpose of this Board report is to update the Board with proposed changes and new information
that has become available since the presentation of the 2014 Requested Budget at the Board Study
Session. The 2014 Recommended Budget will be presented at the November Financial
Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request to forward the budget to the Board for
adoption.
DISCUSSION
The attached power point presentation summarizes the revised assumptions incorporated into the
2014 Requested Budget and the resulting changes from the first draft of the 2014 Requested Budget
previously presented at the Board Study Session. Major revisions from the previous budget draft are
as follows:


Sales/use taxes have been revised upward based on the September CU-Leeds School
forecast. Projected sales/use tax growth rate for 2013 is revised upward from 3.7%
(June forecast) to 5.7% (September forecast) for a positive impact of $9.2 million
(combined Base System and FasTracks) for the year. For 2014, the projected sales/use
tax growth rate is also revised upward from 4.5% (June forecast) to 5.9% (September
forecast) for a combined positive impact of $16.2 million for the year.



Total District-wide operating expenses (excluding depreciation) of $497.6 million have not
materially changed from the first draft 2014 Requested Budget.



Diesel fuel is budgeted at $3.26/gallon, which is the same price that was locked in 2013
for no incremental change. At this time, the current spot price is $3.17 per gallon and the
2014 futures price is $3.21 per gallon. We anticipate that favorable opportunities to lock
a price will materialize for budget certainty.



Gasoline is budgeted at $3.54/gallon, which is the same price that was budgeted in 2013
for no incremental change.



Due to the favorable effect of the sales/use tax September forecast, the combined
unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected at $21.1 million, consisting of $16.7
million for the Base System and $4.4 million for FasTracks.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: October 10, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 8, 2013

Board Meeting Date: October 15, 2013

Subject:

January 2014 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
the January 2014 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an
annualized cost increase of approximately $635,500 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or
his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole while also
continuing to review the impacts of the implementation of the West Corridor Light Rail Service and the
associated bus service changes. Routine service changes not associated with or included in the West
Corridor Service Plan are necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the appropriate
level of service according to customer demand while we will also need to monitor customer response to
the implementation of West Corridor bus and rail service and propose adjustments as appropriate.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Eight public hearings were held between September 18 and September 26, 2013 in Boulder, Denver and
Lakewood. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in
Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS

Packet Pg. 67

Attachment: Board Report January 2014 - Attachment A (1710 : January 2014 Service Changes)

Route AT – Arapahoe County/DIA
Extend 3:42am northbound trip from Nine Mile Station to instead originate at Arapahoe
Station at 3:28am. Provides important employee start time service for Arapahoe
customers. Cost estimated to be $4,600 annualized.

2.B.1.a

Route P – Parker/Denver
Add southbound trip from Civic Center Station at 3:15pm, relieving overloads on the
current first afternoon trip at 3:45pm. Also, move 4:20pm southbound trip to 4:30pm, for
improved load distribution with 4:45pm trip. Extend the 4:11pm trip leaving Civic Center
Station to the Pinery park-n-Ride from its current terminal at Parker park-n-Ride. Cost

connections at Boulder Transit Center. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route YL – Lyons/Longmont:
The Route YL is a Boulder County sponsored CMAQ grant funded service that was
implemented in January 2012. Ridership on this service has leveled off at
10 boardings
per day, which is far below the RTD Service Standard for its service type. It is proposed to
discontinue this service. No cost savings would be realized by the RTD, due to the grant
funding of this service.
D-Line Light Rail
This proposal recommends the permanent closure of the currently temporarily closed station on
the Welton Street segment of the Central Corridor. Since January of 2013 stops on the D-Line
service at the 29th & Welton Station have been temporarily discontinued; as part of the effort to
improve schedule adherence on this segment of the Light Rail network. As previously stated in
the January 2013 Board Report, delayed trains affect our customers’ connections with bus
Routes 12 and 43, as well as some transfers for Routes 28 and 38. Additionally, train delays
from this area cascade throughout the system affecting on-time performance on the system as a
whole. Efforts to address the current problem, which stems from the downtown Denver signal
cycle timing change, include the City of Denver’s implementation of traffic signal priority
measures at the intersection of Park Avenue and Welton. The signal improvements and the
elimination of stopping at the 29th Welton Station resulted in a reduction in train delays from
34% of trips on the Welton segment to 17% along the single track section along Welton. Please
see map for more information. No operational cost impacts are anticipated.
W-Line Light Rail
Schedule for weekdays and weekends will have slight adjustments, based on operating
experience. No cost impact anticipated.

2.B.1.a

Ranches package
Route 77 would have minor schedule adjustments.
Route 401 would have minor schedule adjustments. The 8:18 p.m. westbound and 8:42 p.m.
eastbound trips are proposed to be discontinued, due to low ridership [4 passengers total] (-1
weekday hour).
Route 402Ltd would have minor schedule adjustments. (+2.5 weekday hours if no saved bus in
Route 403)
Route 403 is proposed to be removed from the Dutch Creek deviation. It would continue to
serve Highland Heritage Regional Park from University/Lincoln. It is proposed to discontinue trips
from Littleton/Mineral Station at 8:44 a.m. and from Lincoln Station at 8:52 a.m. due to low
ridership [11 passengers total] (-1.5 weekday hours for trips cut, additional savings from
removing deviation). No cost impact anticipated.

South Simms – Alameda Parkway package
Route 21 is proposed to be returned to its former alignment from West Jewell Ave. via West Yale
Ave., Bear Creek Blvd., and Alameda Parkway and return. Service levels will remain unchanged.
Route 100X would have minor schedule adjustments.
Route 116Ltd is proposed to be rescheduled to increase its span of service, covering times not
covered by Route 116X, as well as retaining the most utilized trips in both morning and afternoon
peaks. Proposed arrivals at Federal Center Station are at 5:48, 7:18 and 8:48 a.m. Proposed
departures from Federal Center Station are at 2:55, 4:25, 5:45 and 7:10 p.m.
Route 116X is proposed to have an additional trip added in each direction, with some trips
rescheduled. Arrivals at Civic Center Station would be at 6:34, 7:14, 7:44 and 8:23 a.m.
Departures – subject to adjustments for gate availability – would be at 3:35 p.m., 4:40 p.m.,
5:25 p.m., and 6:10 p.m. No cost impact anticipated.
Call-n-Ride
Belleview Call-n-Ride began operating in January 2012 under a Congestion Mitigation Air
Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by the Denver South Transportation
Management Association. The Call-n-Ride serves the Denver Technological Center out of
the Belleview Station. In the pm period the Call-n-Ride has been operating a flex route
south of Belleview Ave. Because of the low ridership of the flex route, it is recommended
to discontinue the flex route and have the Call-n-Ride serve our customers by demand
only. No cost impacts are anticipated with this proposal.
Golden Call-n-Ride began operation in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line Light
Rail under a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by
the City of Golden, the Colorado School of Mines and the RTD. The Call-n-Ride operates
one vehicle as a Flex Route and one vehicle as a non-flex route Call-n-Ride. Ridership has
been rising since opening to over 9 boardings per hour. This proposal calls for an
additional 12 hours of Call-n-Ride service be added to the service. Cost impacts are
estimated to be $150,009 (including fuel) annualized.

Thornton/Northglenn Call-n-Ride began operating in December 2003 and the South
Thornton/Northglenn Call-n-Ride began operating in August 2007. These Call-n-Rides are
divided by 112th Avenue. Customers routinely transfer between the two Call-n-Rides at
112th Avenue. This proposal calls for a change that will allow customers to book a trip in
either service area without a transfer. Customers will call the Call-n-Ride that their trip
begins in and will be able to travel to the other Call-n-Ride area without a transfer. No cost
impacts are anticipated with this proposal.

Attachment: Board Report January 2014 - Attachment A (1710 : January 2014 Service Changes)

Longmont Call-n-Ride began operating in February 2001. The Call-n-Ride currently
operates three vehicles during peak periods in the Longmont community. During the
school year, the Call-n-Rides are booked with student related trips. This proposal is to add
an additional vehicle during the school year to be used specifically for students thereby
allowing the regular Call-n-Ride to be used for non-student trips. Annual Cost impacts are
anticipated to be $55,000.

Station to help on-time performance on the D Line. It was also asked that RTD not just
abandon and neglect the station after closure, but to do something useful with the site.
Constituents also spoke on the proposed Central Corridor where support was given for
continuing as light rail to 38th & Blake Station. It was also suggested that there be more
warnings for pedestrians at Switch 21 when delayed trains are able to continue.

Curtis Park Neighbors Feedback on Proposal to Permanently Close 29th/Welton Light Rail Station
Curtis Park Neighbors (CPN) appreciates the outreach and careful review that RTD staff has done
regarding the closure of the 29th/Welton light rail stop.
29TH/WELTON CLOSURE IMPROVES OPERATIONS RELIABILITY, BUT STATION CANNOT BE
ALLOWED TO BECOME A BLIGHT, AND SAFETY AT 30TH/DOWNING MUST BE ADDRESSED
The data collected this year agrees with riders’ experience: the set of changes including the closure of the
29th/Welton station, the implementation of north-bound signal-priority at Park Avenue for the light rail
trains, and other schedule adjustments have improved the overall D-line’s on-time performance and have
improved connections at 30th/Downing. In the current circumstances, the closure of the 29th/Welton
station was worthwhile and the station should remain closed.
However, we have two significant concerns that must be addressed in conjunction with the permanent
closure of the 29th/Welton Station:


The 29th/Welton station platform and area must be kept as attractive as possible, with no
unsightly construction fencing, weeds, rusty or broken features, or other signs of deterioration.
Ideally the station vertical elements should be removed to limit the appearance of being an
“abandoned station.” Despite the lack of a stop at this location in the immediate term, the
revitalization of that part of the corridor should not be hindered by signs of blight at the former
station.



RTD must do more to improve safety and a sense of security at the 30th/Downing station,
parking, and transfer area. One of the most frequent concerns we heard when the trial closure of
29th/Welton was proposed and began was from residents, some with children, who had been using
that station because of real and legitimate safety concerns at 30th/Downing.
RTD has a track record of ignoring repeated requests – including requests by CPN delivered at
RTD Board meetings – to address aspects of safety at 30th/Downing, such as long-burned-out
lights. (The lights were not addressed by RTD after years of asking until we engaged the command
staff of the Denver Police Department, who demanded and got RTD Facilities’ attention and
finally had the lighting repaired in May.) Police records and neighborhood experience continue to
show safety issues at 30th/Downing, including a call for assistance by DPD just yesterday in
identifying suspects in a brutal beating and robbery in September. (See attached news stories.)

2.B.1.d

RTD must do more to improve safety at 30th /Downing, particularly recognizing that the
closure of the 29th/Welton station has removed an important way for residents to stay out of a
known troubled area. CPN would like to work with RTD and the Denver Police on a specific
action plan for improving security at 30th/Downing.

EVEN WITH 29TH/WELTON CLOSURE, ON-TIME PERFORMANCE ON NORTH-BOUND RAIL TO
30TH/DOWNING REMAINS POOR. LONG-TERM PLANNING MUST PRIORITIZE LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS.
The review presented by RTD staff at several forums in the past weeks showed that although overall Dline on-time performance is now back above 90%, the north-bound D-line on Welton, mid-day, is only
on-time to 30th/Downing a poor 66% of the time. Although improved from its prior state, as discussed
above, it must be acknowledged that this is still quite bad. Efforts to identify and address the causes of the
on-time performance problems that remain must continue.
Looking at the longer-term, RTD should continue working with the community on developing a
preferred alternative for two-way double-track rail operations on Welton, as envisioned in the
Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan and other plans, and as is being examined in RTD’s Central
Rail Extension Project. The developed alternative must:


Continue high-quality rail service in the Welton/Downing corridor,



Have stops approximately every two blocks, including in the “Arapahoe Square” area,



Be capable of excellent on-time performance,



Provide a one-seat ride from 38th/Blake into downtown with easy transfers to light rail lines,
the free MallRide, the new free MetroRide circulator, and connections to key destinations
downtown, and



Be capable of handling existing and future passenger demand as this corridor becomes more
heavily used by local residents, visitors to the commercial corridor, and passengers connecting
between the East Corridor and downtown. This may require the ability to increase service
frequency as a means of meeting increased ridership over the long-term.

This position was adopted by CPN following presentations by RTD staff and internal discussions, and was
voted on unanimously by the Board of Directors of CPN.

Re: The Closing of the Light Rail Station at 29th and Welton St.
Dear Board of Directors:
The Five Points Business District represents property owners, business owners, and
community stakeholders in the heart of Historic Five Points. As you know, the above
referenced station is located on the main street of our culturally historic Welton Street
Corridor.
We felt it was important to announce this proposed closing to our mailing list of over 800
community stakeholders and on our Face Book page. We included this subject matter on the
agenda of our monthly community meeting held Saturday, October 6, where Mr. Jesse Carter
from RTD spoke about the benefits of closing this station. While we did not receive a multitude
of complaints, I am concerned that the protests will not really take place until the station is
actually closed in January, one of the coldest months of the year.
We recognize that the proposed closing may significantly increase the on-time performance
and service reliability of this train. However, our property owners who are re -developing their
sites to enhance the commercial prosperity of this area are not inclined to agree that
increasing the on-time performance rate will outweigh the benefits of spurring development
activities on this corridor.
Case in point: The Five Points community is included in RTD”s TOD Pilot Program to study the
possibilities of developing land that RTD owns to revitalize our neighborhood. The RTD/TOD
Pilot Program case study is on the parcel of land that is directly across the street from the 29th
and Welton St. station.

Will this closure affect developers from investing in RTD/TOD’s project if RTD should decide to
pursue development? Will closing the station deter other property owners from investing in
the neighborhood?
These questions are difficult to answer right now but should be asked and answered prior to
making the decision to permanently close this station. We hope that the RTD Board evaluates
not only the on-time performance and reliability issue but also the effect this closure has had
on the commuters, the residents, and the property owners that are being encouraged to
redevelop our historic district.
Sincerely,

Tracy J. Winchester
Executive Director

Date:

October 8, 2013

Board Meeting Date: October 15, 2013

Subject:

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active duty
members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of December
31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal
impact on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution allowing
active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006. This offer has
been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December 31, 2013. As a
result of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard,
National Guard, and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special services such as
SkyRide and BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel must either be in
uniform or present an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date of
December 31, 2013 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited again
next year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States
Military.

Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and
Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Project
Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project replaces a 1993-era radio and dispatch system. With a
regulatory radio licensing change, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) requires that RTD’s old
radio frequency spectrum be replaced by the end of 2013. Because the legacy CAD/AVL system was so
tightly integrated with the radio system, it was also necessary to replace the CAD/AVL system.
Innovations in Transportation (INIT) was selected as the CAD/AVL vendor, Motorola is the radio vendor
and Sprint provides cellular data service. Now that installations are completed and the legacy system is
being decommissioned, RTD is meeting its FCC obligations.
Following is a capsulated summary of current and upcoming activities.

complaints addressing; announcement volume (both high and
low); frequency; infringing on one’s quiet time; and missing
announcements. Anecdotal observations by some drivers

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Smart Card Program (Phase 1) continues to gather rider taps for bus and train EcoPass and
CollegePass riders. During the month of September, 2013, taps including both first boarding and
transfers increased to 1.24M. The Smartcard Customer Service Center, (operated under an RTD
contract with Xerox by Celina, Inc.) continues to distribute new cards upon request, issue replacement
cards and answer riders’ questions as they arise. SmartCard Customer Service metrics such as calls per
week, call types and average on-hold times are reviewed weekly.
RTD’s Treasury Department has taken ownership of the installation of additional platform validators at
various locations throughout the RTD light rail system. In addition, reports have been developed for
Treasury’s use that will assist them in identifying trends in platform validator usage, which will identify
locations where additional platform validators may be required.
Arrangements are currently being made to train the over 35 RTD Street Supervisors in the use of the
Handheld Smart Media Readers or HSMRs. The Street Supervisors will perform many of the same types
of Fare Inspection activities as those performed by the Fare Inspectors that ride RTD Light Rail. Training
is currently scheduled for completion on Friday, October 25th.
In partnership with Xerox, the SMT Program Team continues to work on Phase 1 improvements and is
defining the final scope and deliverables for Phase 2 (MyRide/Stored Value.) Ongoing activities include


Modifications and improvements to current web functionality. Functionality will improve College
Transit Coordinator adoption of the site and allow for a smoother renewal period for EcoPass
customers.
Modifications to current administrative point of sale functionality
Repair of approximately 384 broken and defective onboard stanchions (validator mounting
brackets). Work began in late August and is expected to take approximately 10 weeks.
ADA compliance improvements on existing platform validators

A new Braille sticker for the platform validators has been
designed and printed in-house using technology that exists in
RTD’s print shop. The new sticker will be reviewed by
members of the Coalition for the Blind to obtain their
feedback sometime in November. Xerox is also researching
the possibility of purchasing and replacing the stickers to
enhance the ADA accessibility of the platform validators.

The Marketing strategy for re-educating the general public on
tapping procedures has been altered to accommodate the
date for Fare Inspection go-live. The team has an estimated
date of February 1, 2014 for Fare Inspection to being in
earnest. Marketing plans to move forward with installing
signs on trains reminding riders of the correct tapping
procedures as well as when a rider is required to show their
ID. Once the Fare Inspection go-live date is established,
Marketing will kick off the full public/college student reeducation plan.
Members of the SMT Program Team met with
representatives of the Denver Mayor’s Office and the City &
County of Denver to discuss the strategy and technical
requirements of creating a smart card system that would
provide students with the ability to use one card to gain
access to RTD transportation, Denver recreational centers,
libraries, and their schools. Although members of the Denver
Public School District were invited, no one was able to
attend. No further action has been taken since our last
update.

ADA Concerns Update

Information

In our continued efforts to ensure that passengers with disabilities and elderly passengers are able to ride
RTD buses and light rail without difficulty, RTD and the private contractors have taken the following
actions:
Operator Education
Priority Seating Area policy – RTD Bus Operations issued several Transportation Bulletins for all
operators (RTD and private contractors) reminding them of the operator’s obligation to ensure that a
customer using a mobility device has access to the priority seating/securement area. Operators were
reminded that passengers with packages, large items, baggage, or baby strollers utilizing the securement
area should be asked politely to move towards the back, or find another seat. Operators were also
advised to assist if necessary. This information was consolidated and placed in a prominent location in
the August 2013 edition of the Trailblazer.
ADA Pass Up Button – RTD implemented a notification button on the radio system Mobile Data Terminal
(MDT), and operators are instructed to push this button whenever they are not able to accommodate a
passenger in a mobility device. The “ADA Pass Up” button sends a high priority message to RTD
Dispatch so that immediate steps can be taken to address the situation. In addition, RTD and the private
contractors receive a daily report of all incidents where the “ADA Pass Up” button was activated so that
video can be pulled from the bus and reviewed by management to ensure that the operator followed
proper procedures.
Review of ADA Policies and Procedures – All Operators (RTD and private contractors) were given and
acknowledged receipt of a letter that reviewed several RTD policies and procedures related to RTD’s
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as it applies to transit. These reminders
included the following:
1) Steps Operators are REQUIRED to follow in order to accommodate a passenger with a mobility
device:
 GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT to see if the securement area is occupied by other passengers.
 Look for open seating toward the rear of the bus.
 Request that the securement area be made available. Offer to help passengers move their items
to the open areas.
 Thank passengers for their cooperation
 If space cannot be made, advise all passengers that you must inform Dispatch and wait at the
stop for further direction
 Call Dispatch by using the “ADA Pax Pass-Up” button on the Mobile Data Terminal.
 Inform Dispatch of the situation, and they will give you information about how the customer will
be accommodated, which you must relay to the customer BEFORE leaving the stop.
 Offer a courtesy transfer to the customer. Provide your name, bus number, route and block upon
request.

Packet Pg. 104

2.C.3

2) A reminder that an aide or personal care attendant accompanying a disabled passenger may ride for
free whether the passengers is using a mobility device or not.
3) A reminder that Operators are to permit any customer with an assistance animal to ride RTD without
interference.
ADA Mandatory Training – All Operators (RTD and private contractors) are participating in a mandatory
ADA refresher training class which reinforces the items listed above. A copy of the training class
PowerPoint slides is included with this update. The content of the ADA refresher training class was
shared with Julie Reiskin of the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC) to ensure that all salient
points from the CCDC’s perspective were addressed. Ms. Reiskin gave her approval of the ADA
refresher training class content.
During the ADA refresher training class, Operators are given the opportunity to do some role playing in
order to learn methods for handling conflicts that arise when passengers compete for space in the
priority seating/securement area.
All Operations personnel, including Dispatchers, Street Supervisors, Division Supervisors, and Managers
are also required to participate in the ADA refresher training class to ensure that Operators are supported
when faced with an ambulatory passenger that refuses to move from the priority seating/securement
area. This information has also been shared with the Telephone Information Center (TIC) so that a
consistent message is passed on to our customers.
Operator’s Information Page and Bulletin Board – This on-line communication tool for operators will be
updated to include reminders about the Priority Seating/Securement policy and the steps Operators are
required to follow. In addition, operators can use this forum to ask questions and get advice for
handling issues that may arise.
Instructor’s Forum – This is a quarterly newsletter that is produced cooperatively by the RTD Bus
Operator trainers and the private contractor trainers. The newsletter provides helpful reminders on ADA
requirements and RTD’s policies and procedures. The newsletter is shared with all Operators.
Public Education
Share the Ride – RTD Marketing has produced interior signs for buses and light rail, as well as flyers that
encourage passengers to move from the priority seating/securement area in order to make room for a
passenger with a mobility device or other disability. A copy of the flyer in included with this update.
Operators will also be provided a pad of “Share the Ride” handouts (a smaller version of the flyer) that
they can give to passengers as needed.
The “Share the Ride” campaign was developed in conjunction with members of the RTD Bus Operator
Training Department and the DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force (The Task Force was created over
two years ago to work on removing barriers to transit for people with disabilities and is comprised of
individuals from disability advocacy groups, city governments, and RTD).
Social Media – RTD Marketing will post and promote its relevant policies on its website and social media
pages.

Packet Pg. 105

2.C.3

Interior Signage – Revised signs will be placed on the interior of buses and light rail cars near the priority
seating/securement area stating, “The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that these seats be
designated for individuals with disabilities and for those who use mobility devices. Please comply with
your bus operator’s request when asked to move from this area. Thank you for your cooperation.”
Additional Outreach – Operations personnel are working with the RTD Title VI Manager to develop a
focused plan to reach out to various women’s organizations to discuss the Priority Seating/Securement
policy, the impact it could have on passengers using strollers, and strategies for lessening the impact.

Management Oversight
Staff is working on a tracking system to monitor all ADA-related complaints in order to identify issues
and trends. Appropriate action will be taken to assure RTD policies are being followed consistently.
Video is pulled for all ADA-related complaints and anytime the “ADA Pass Up” button is activated on the
bus radio MDT. Operators are addressed whenever the video verifies that the operator did not follow
proper procedures.

Accessing the Priority Seating/Securement Area

Stroller Policy

Customers using strollers have other
options for transporting small children
not available to riders using mobility
devices.

They may need assistance
locating or moving to an
available seat. If asked to
help do so pleasantly.

A primary purpose of the policy
is to remind customers with
strollers that even if they sit in a
priority seating area, they may
have to collapse the stroller and
move to the rear of the bus if
those seats are needed for
those with disabilities.

with all requests to move from the
securement or priority seating area
when requested by the operator.
• They may need assistance locating or

Accessing the Priority Seating/Securement Area
An operator must make every reasonable attempt to
accommodate a passenger in a wheelchair. Other
riders occupying the securement area is not an excuse
for refusing to accommodate this customer.
Never assume or state to the customer using a
mobility device that the bus is too crowded until
you have taken the following steps:
1. Look first to see if other customers are blocking the
securement area or access to the securement area.
2. Get out of your seat and look to see if there is space
available towards the back of the bus.
3. Stand in front of the person sitting in the priority
seating area, look them in the eye, and state politely,
but firmly “I need to use these seats to allow a
customer with a disability to board please.”
4. If necessary, point to the sign and ask the passenger
to comply with your request.
