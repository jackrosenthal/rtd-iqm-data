#### 1. Civil Rights Highlights and Updates Report

Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager for the Civil Rights Division stated that they have had several great achievements in the WIN program.  Martell Dyles, acting WIN Program Manager reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the Board that can be found in the April 9, 2013 Civil Rights Committee Agenda Packet.

Kenn stated that they had shown the WIN participants’ perspective before and now they wanted to provide the employer perspective of the benefits of the WIN program.  Mr. Martin C. Willie of Civil Technologies, a construction management professional service firm, stated that they have worked in different projects with RTD.  To date, they have 7 employees out of the WIN program and expect it to grow.  They received incredible support from the WIN project managers with ongoing professional development for the staff.  They also have support from two of their partners to make sure that 100% of the I-225 staff comes from the WIN program.  They applaud GM Washington, the Board and staff for the vision and direction of the WIN program.

Kenn stated the Small and Disadvantage Enterprise Advisory Council (S/DBEAC) was created by an MOU.  This group meets quarterly and has approximately 50 people, of which 45 represent small business organizations and minority contractors.  Some of the businesses are already doing work with RTD and others want to do business with RTD.  They come together to provide information about contracting opportunities that are available at RTD.  S/DBEAC helps increase relationships with RTD and provides notices of upcoming opportunities in the corridors.   S/DBEAC also provides information about outreach in the community, as well as information on courses on how to do business with RTD and how to get certified.  It includes collaboration with other entities.  They have nominated a Co-Chair, Ms. Helga Grunerud.  She is with the Hispanic Contractors of Colorado.  She will be working with the S/DBEAC group to guide them to make sure they provide good opportunities.

During the last Civil Rights Committee meeting staff recognized a number of contractors that participated in the West Rail Line, such as Denver Transit Construction Group, for doing such an outstanding job with all the DBEs (over 200).  They put together a trucker consortium to allow truckers to participate on a rotating basis and they had more truckers that ever before.  They also recognized the internal staff that assisted with special programs.

Director Hoy asked if the Community College of Denver (CCD) is also affiliated with Front Range Community Colleges and if it gets any bigger than just CCD.  Kenn stated that the CCD is one of the founding partners while the Front Range Community College is one of the network partners.  Director Hoy asked Martin Willie what type of jobs they offer and how many employees they have from the WIN program.  Mr. Willie stated that they have a total of 35 employees and 7 people have come from the WIN program.  He also mentioned that these employees range from administration and field personnel to very technical positions such as construction lab manager.

Director Folska commended Kenn for what they have done so far.  She can see that there is a tremendous impact in the communities.  She asked how many employees RTD has in the WIN program.  Martell stated that there are 120 employees and that the project started with 25.  They come from different training providers, network and neighborhoods; there is a very good pool of people.  Director Folska commented that the average starting salary looks great and asked what the range for the salaries is.  Martell stated that salaries range from $12.00 to $18.00 in some cases and that the FasTracks projects start at $13.00 and move to $16.00.   Director Folska asked if aside from the capital infrastructure projects are there any plans to expand to other types of jobs.  Martell stated that they are looking to expanding depending on the participants that come into the program.  They are creating career pathways so that people coming in have a starting and end points.  Director Folska stated that it would be a shame for the program to go away when FasTracks is finished.  We need to see how to keep the program going past FasTracks. Kenn reminded them that RTD is also one of the employers, and that is why the pathway program was created.  They started at rail operations, but there are many areas where they can go within the career pathways.  Director Folska mentioned that the veteran’s administration might be a good source to help provide candidates.

GM Washington stated that with regard to the maintenance of the project, the original idea was to tie the WIN program to the maintenance operation piece.  They are already talking to maintenance transit partners to think about WIN candidates moving over from the construction side.  Staff is also to encourage companies doing transit oriented development to bring WIN candidates.

Director Deadwyler thanked Kenn and the staff.  She stated that we have come a long way; they have done a wonderful job, though we still have a long way to go.  She knows that many people in the WIN project still have a job, and she’s proud of the accomplishments.

Director Lubow commended the staff for the two programs; they are both admirable in concept and execution.

Director Rivera-Malpiede invited the Board members to attend the DBEAC meeting.  It is a standing room only, and it is such a tremendous asset for the community and the contractors trying to work with RTD.  The Civil Rights Division is focusing on communication, inclusionary and transparency.  She thanked the staff.

##### a. RTD

#### 2. RTD Subcontractor Performance Bond Program

Bob Medina and Jim Stadler were recognized for their efforts.  Marla Lien stated that the Subcontractor Performance Self-insured Program (SPSP) was designed to get smaller subcontractor to participate in the RTD West Line Project.  RTD took a financial risk and it was 100% successful.  The SPSP will also be implemented in the I-225 corridor.   She mentioned that payment and performance bonds are required by statue for the Prime contractor but not for lower tier contractors.  Both the Prime and small tier contractors mentioned that sometimes for the Prime contractors to get their bonds, they would flow down the requirements to the smaller tier contractor; therefore, some of the smallest contractors that did not have the history or were just starting could not get into the project.  RTD wanted to fix that and we did it in a way that took some risk for RTD.  Marla is happy to report that it was successful; we did not lose any of the funds invested.  RTD has a very good history of self-insurance.

For new companies it can be hard to get those bonds.  We developed the program where we would say to the prime contractor that they could not require the smaller subcontractor contractually to get the bonds.  RTD could not charge the subcontractor for the bonds; otherwise we would become an insurance company.  We also contractually limited the Prime on what they could claim against subcontractors.  Staff developed the implementation manual and a very robust program to qualify and monitor the SBE/DBEs.

Every contractor below the $500,000 level had to be in the pool.  In the end, the West Corridor is near completion and there have not been any claims.  They had 37 subcontractors in the program, 23 of them DBE subcontractors.  They had 13 new subcontractors to RTD and 9 subcontractors that had never qualified for a bond.  The contract maximum value increased to about $1 million with an estimated savings to RTD of $243,681 compared to construction bonds.  The fund will be rolled over to I-225 and Kiewit has asked to be in the program.

Kenn stated that those subcontractors are all over Colorado and there are some great stories.

Director Hoy asked if the risk for the SPSP has been minimized because of the pool.  Marla Lien stated that the risk was having to pay if any of the contractors defaulted.  The pool is still there and it rolls out to the next project.  The hope is that they will not have to pay.   Director Hoy stated that he understands that the risk doesn’t go away as there is always a chance that we would need to pay.

Director Anderson commented that it is great that no one defaulted at the West Corridor and asked if we have any recourse in case someone defaults.  Marla Lien stated that there is a bond, but we guarantee to the Prime that they would have access to the fund.  Director Anderson asked if the qualification to be an SBE has changed.  She remembers that if a company had $775,000 in assets it didn’t qualified as an SBE. Kenn stated that it has been increased to almost $1.2 million.

##### a. 2013 APTA Legal Presentation

#### 3. ADA Program Update

Kenn stated that they are working on the development of this program.  They expect to have some more information by the May meeting.  They are working with the legal team and will come to the Board with updates.

### D. Other Matters

Director Bagley stated that the Board members should have received the Survey Monkey last Friday, April 9 for the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee.  He reported that 9 out of 15 have responded already.  The deadline to respond is April 19.  He thanked those who responded.

Director Menten stated that she was present over the phone though she couldn’t hear the Board members, only the presenters.
