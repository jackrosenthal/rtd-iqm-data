RTD’S
SUBCONTRACTOR
PERFORMANCE
SELF-INSURED PROGRAM
Presenter:
Marla Lien, General Counsel
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
Packet Pg. 11

PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM
To eliminate bonding as an obstacle to the participation of small
and disadvantaged business sub-contractors in RTD
construction projects.
Background
2004 – RTD signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with
The African American Leadership Group (TAALG), the Hispanic
Contractors Association, and Colorado Women’s and Minority
Chamber committing to keep those and other DBE/SBE
contractors and business groups informed of RTD FasTracks
project development and contracting opportunities.
A key concern raised by these groups – the impediment
bonding posed to small businesses.

RTD EXPERIENCE
WITH SELF INSURANCE
RTD had a history of owner-controlled and self-insured programs for
construction projects
• Liability
• Worker’s Compensation
• Railroad Protection
• Builder’s Risk
• Property coverage
Risk/benefit principles comparable - avoid premiums and transaction
costs for multiple party coverage

LEGAL REQUIREMENTS
DRIVING THE PROGRAM
COLORADO BONDING REQUIREMENT
C.R.S. 38-26-106 requires that contractor’s post a bond “in a penal sum not less than
one-half of the total amount payable under the terms of the contract” or for contracts
in excess of $500 million not less than one half the maximum amount payable in any
contract year. Bond pays for labor, materials of performance for work by contractor.
•

Contractor’s typically flow down bonding requirements to their sub-contractor’s but
this is not statutorily required in Colorado.

FEDERAL DBE REQUIREMENTS
49 C.F.R.26.51(b) Race-neutral means include, but are not limited to, the following:
(2) providing assistance in overcoming limitations such as inability to obtain bonding
or financing (e.g. by such means as simplifying the bonding process, reducing
bonding requirements, eliminating the impact of surety costs from bids and providing
services to help DBE’s and other small business obtain bonding and financing).

1.C.2.a

KEY PROGRAM ELEMENTS
RTD sets up self-funded risk pool to cover claims that could otherwise
have been made against subcontractor sureties – failure to pay for
materials, or failure to perform
RTD prohibits contractors from requiring subcontractor payment and
performance bonds
RTD prohibits subcontractors from obtaining bonds unless there is no
charge in the bid
RTD establishes eligibility and monitoring requirements for
subcontractors in program
ALL subcontractors with contracts equal to or less than $500 thousand
required to participate in program
q

Whether or not DBE/SBE,

q

Whether or not able to bond independently

COST OF THE PROGRAM
•

Program funding is based on assumed savings – no premiums collected from
participants
q

Note: in Colorado, a surety bond is an insurance contract (see, C.R.S. 13-3-1102;
Transamerica Premier Insurance Company v. Brighton School District 27 J, 940 P. 2d 348
(Colo. 1997)).

q

The receiving or collection of any premium, commission, membership fees, assessments,
dues or other consideration for any insurance or any part thereof by an unauthorized
insurer constitutes transacting insurance business in Colorado (C.R.S. 10-3-903).

•

RTD works with insurance broker to determine amount each sub-contractor would
have paid for bonds had it been required to provide them, plus overhead and profit
that would have been added at every tier

•

RTD deposits that amount in Program Fund

•

Prime contractor agrees by contract to limit claims against subcontractors that
would have been made against payment or performance bond to amounts in
Program Fund.
– Prime must require subs at every level to put corresponding contract
requirement in its subcontracts.
