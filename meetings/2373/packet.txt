2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant
Contract Award

Discussion

It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option to the Virtegic Group,
Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant,
extending the period of performance through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work
is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD
Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed
$745,411.52 for the year 2016. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016 Recommended
Budget for the FasTracks program.
BACKGROUND
Utilizing a Public Information Consultant team to extend the staffing needs of the FasTracks Public
Information Program contributes to the agency’s Board adopted goal to Advance/Complete
FasTracks.
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information, Communications a nd
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group,
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award, at a rate that was
approximately half that of the previous Public Information Consultant.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or increased from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work in January 2012 and the RTD Board approved th ree previous option years
through 2015. In the three years of working as the FasTracks public information consultant so far,
the Virtegic team members have satisfactorily performed their work assignments and have remained
flexible in meeting the needs of the public information program during several key staff transitions.
They are also playing a key role in augmenting RTD Public Relations outreach, as FasTracks projects
begin transitioning into base system operational services.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract to Virtegic for 2012 was in the amount of $451,459.20. The first one -year
option for 2013 was $485,167.20. The second one-year option for 2014 was $487,308.80. The
third one-year option for 2015 was $686,009.60. The fourth one-year option for 2016 is not to
exceed $745,411.52 bringing the total on this contract to $2,855,356.32. The option to provide

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

additional staffing to assist with specific corridor public information project outreach as well as
preparation for the FasTracks project openings in 2016 is being exercised. It is crucial that proper
amounts of staff who have direct experience with RTD’s programs, procedures and policies be in
place to provide adequate resources for the unprecedented five rapid transit line openings in 2016,
something with which no other transit agency has ever been tasked.
The FasTracks Public Information Program is implemented through six functional areas: Internal
Relations, Government Relations, Media Relations, Public Involvement, Public Outreach, and Crisis
Communications. The 2016 PIC scope of work is divided into the PI Program’s function al areas.
The 2016 Scope of Work is as follows:

members and three part-time staff members.

o

FINANCIAL IMPACT

the FasTracks program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the fourth and final

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.1

one-year option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through
2016. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant staff, and
awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment
is for an amount not to exceed $745,411.52 for the year 2016, the final year of the contract.
Funds for the award are contained in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultan t approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program and specific FasTracks design and construction projects, especially given the
fact that RTD is opening an unprecedented five major transit lines in 2016. This alternative would
delay and negatively impact the effective implementation of the FasTracks Public Information
Program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
fourth and final one-year option to Virtegic Group, Incorporated. Issue another Request for
Proposals for professional services for Public Information, Communications and Public Out reach
for the FasTracks Program and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not
recommended as the Virtegic team is satisfactorily performing its work and has been flexible in
meeting the changing communication needs of the FasTracks program. Also, this alternative will
delay and negatively impact the successful implementation of the various strategies and activities
associated with a comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort, especially given the
fact that RTD is opening an unprecedented five major transit lines in 2016.

Subject:

Approval of Contract Amendment to Jacobs
Engineering for FasTracks Program Support
Consulting Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in an amount not to
exceed $22,579,180, for Program Support Services Consulting for FasTracks through June 30,
2017. Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the 2016 work program is included in the 2016
Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific projects where PSC support
would be utilized. Funding for the balance of the contract through June 30, 2017 is included in the
2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017, and will be appropriated in the specific projects in the
2017 capital budget.
BACKGROUND
On May 24, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to CarterBurgess (later purchased by Jacobs Engineering) for Program Support Consulting Services at an initial
2005 Contract amount of $2,360,000, and a Notice to Proceed of July 5, 2005. The RTD Board has
approved subsequent contract amendments that have brought the current Contract Not-to-Exceed price
up to $168,844,156.
The Contract Not-to-Exceed price through the end of 2016 with this contract amendment would be
$185,778,336. The total contract not-to-exceed value through June 30, 2017, which is the contract
end date, would be $191,423,336.
The PSC team provides program management support and specialized technical staff support to augment
RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key PSC staff members are co-located with RTD Staff at the RTD FasTracks
offices. The PSC functions as an extension of RTD staff. This approach adds value, cost-effectively, by
allowing RTD to tap the PSC’s specialized resources in planning, environmental, design, engineering,
construction management support, program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed, often parttime, basis.
Further, as the focus of the FasTracks program has shifted from planning and design to construction and
start up, the staff resources required for support of the program shift similarly. The PSC role has
changed, and will continue to change, to meet the evolving needs of the FasTracks program. This
flexibility allows RTD to retain the core staff required for implementation of the FasTracks program,
without having to continually (and inefficiently) staff up and then staff down in the planning, design, and
construction management disciplines.
Some of the key deliverables and assistance, in process or received, from the Jacobs/PSC team in 2015
included:

DISCUSSION
The Program Support Services Contract was specified for a term of six years with a six-year option, to
be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work tasks. The purpose of the annual re-negotiation of
the contract is to ensure that specific tasks and deliverables respond to the evolving needs of the
FasTracks Program.
The PSC serves as an extension of RTD staff. RTD staff provides overall management and control of
the FasTracks program and administration of this contract. The PSC provides key personnel to a number
of tasks. These assignments are based on focusing the PSC effort to:


Areas of specialized expertise or experience.



Part-time assignments.



Shorter duration efforts.



Positions that are difficult for RTD to fill.

Each position in the FasTracks organization is evaluated individually to determine whether that position
falls within the above criteria for using a consultant. In addition, before a consultant is actually brought
into the FasTracks program, an assessment is made as to whether the position is still needed, and an
interview is conducted with the appropriate RTD manager(s).
The major program activities in 2016 include the following:


Testing and start-up of the Eagle P3 project.



Construction, testing and start-up of I-225 Project.



Final design and construction of the North Metro Line.

During 2016, the PSC contract identifies the following specific tasks in support of FasTracks:

RTD expects the PSC effort to be reduced substantially in 2017. The Eagle and I-225 projects are
scheduled to open in 2016, leaving a reduced need for project support through closeout. In addition, the
contract term only extends through the first six months of the year. Therefore, the estimated maximum
contract cost for 2017 is approximately one-third of the cost for 2016. The specific work scope for
2017 would be established in late 2016.
RTD has established a 7% DBE goal for this Contract. The latest DBE report indicates that the PSC’s
actual cumulative DBE percentage has been 20.2%. For 2016, the PSC has committed to 19% DBE
participation, well in excess of the 7% goal. Additionally, while not in their contract, the PSC has
committed to continuing their participation in the WIN program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the PSC contract from 2005 through 2017, would be
$191,423,336 with this amendment. Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the 2016 work
program is included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program in the specific
projects where PSC support would be utilized. Funding for the balance of the contract through June 30,
2017 is included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017, and will be appropriated in the
specific projects in the 2017 capital budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to
Jacobs Engineering, in an amount not to exceed $22,579,180, for Program Support Services
Consulting for FasTracks through June 30, 2017. Funding in the amount of $16,934,180 for the
2016 work program is included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital program
in the specific projects where PSC support would be utilized. Funding for the balance of the contract
through June 30, 2017 is included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation for 2017, and will be
appropriated in the specific projects in the 2017 capital budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
eighth year contract amendment to Jacobs Engineering. Rather, perform all the work in-house with
RTD staff. This is not recommended as RTD does not have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
expertise in a cost-effective approach to manage the FasTracks Program (As described in the
Background section, the PSC team can provide the technical specialties on an as needed basis).
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Re-solicit this work to another consulting team. This is not
recommended as the PSC is satisfactorily performing its work assignments and providing valuable
technical and project management assistance to the RTD team.
Selection of alternatives two or three would delay the implementation of the FasTracks Program as there
would be a major loss of continuity on the program.

Approval of 2016 – 2017 Contract
Amendment to Delcan for FasTracks Quality
Management Consultant Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the 2016 – 2017 Contract Amendment for Delcan in the amount of
$2,669,575 for FasTracks Quality Management Consulting Services. The term of this Contract
Amendment covers the period of January 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017 when the Contract ends. The
cost breakdown for 2016 and 2017 are $1,662,900 and $1,006,675 respectively. Funds for the
amendment are contained in the 2016 RTD FasTracks Budget.
BACKGROUND
On June 28, 2005, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to Delcan for
Quality Management Consulting Services at an initial 2005 contract price of $418,539, and a Notice to
Proceed of August 1, 2005. This contract was set up to run for an initial six-year term, re-negotiated
and amended annually, based on the needs of the program. The contract also included provisions for a
six-year option.
On December 13, 2005, the RTD Board approved a second year contract amendment for 2006 in the
amount of $1,100,000.
On November 14, 2006, the RTD Board approved a third year contract amendment for 2007 in the
amount of $1,500,000.
On November 20, 2007, the RTD Board approved a fourth year contract amendment for 2008 in the
amount of $1,335,000.
On November 18, 2008, the RTD Board approved a fifth year contract amendment for 2009 in the
amount of $1,340,000.
On November 17, 2009, the RTD Board approved a sixth year contract amendment for 2010. The
actual cost proposal for the 2010 workscope was $1,400,000; but because of cumulative budget
underruns from previous years, the total Contract Not-to-Exceed price only needed to be increased by
$600,000 in order to deliver the 2010 work.
On November 23, 2010, the Board approved a seventh year contract amendment for 2011 in the
amount of $1,550,000, and authorized the six-year option included in the original contract.
On November 22, 2011, the Board approved an eighth year contract amendment for 2012 in the
amount of $1,645,422.
On November 20, 2012, the Board approved a ninth year contract amendment for 2013 in the



Establishment of a Quality Oversight Program for Contracted work
o Revised Quality Oversight Program procedures.
o Maintained RTD’s requirements database to incorporate changes as projects transitioned
from design to construction.
o Updated QMO Database applications to provide user-requested functionality, improved



Establishment of Internal Quality Audit Program for Project Management Processes

and project controls procedures.

DISCUSSION
The Quality Management Consultant contract was specified for an initial term of six years, with a sixyear option, to be negotiated annually for the upcoming year’s work scope. The purpose of the annual
re-negotiation of the contract was to ensure that specific tasks and deliverables responded to the needs
of the FasTracks program. Because 2017 is only a partial year and the scope will be largely the same as
2016, the work is being incorporated into what is expected to be a final Contract Amendment. For 2016
- 2017, related RTD work includes design-build of the Eagle Project, I225 Corridor, North Metro Rail
Line, and Southeast Rail Extension. The following tasks/substasks highlight the assistance to be
provided by the Delcan/QMC Team in 2016 - 2017:
 Establishment of a Quality Management Oversight (QMO) Program for Contracted work
o Revise Quality Oversight Program manual and procedures as required.
o Maintain RTD’s requirements database to incorporate changes.
o Maintain/update QMO Database applications to incorporate program improvements.

RTD has established a 5% DBE Goal for this Contract. Delcan’s actual cumulative DBE percentage to
date has been 8.5%. For the 2016 – 2017 term, Delcan has committed to 7.3% DBE participation,
exceeding the established goal as they have every year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this contract amendment are included in the 2016 RTD FasTracks budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1.

Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the 2016 - 2017 contract
amendment to Delcan in the amount of $2,669,575. Funds for the award are contained in the
2016 FasTracks budget.

2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
2016 - 2017 contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, perform all of the work in-house with RTD
staff. This is not recommended, as RTD doesn’t have certain skills required to fully develop the
Quality Management program.

3.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
2016 - 2017 contract amendment to Delcan. Rather, re-solicit and award this work to another
consulting team. This is not recommended, as Delcan is satisfactorily performing its work
assignments and providing valuable quality management assistance to the RTD team.

Station Names for Eagle P3 Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and
approve the proposed station name for the Eagle P3 Project “Gateway Station” as follows.
East Corridor:
Peña Boulevard
BACKGROUND:
Station names for the East Corridor were originally assigned during the East corridor Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) completed in 2009. At the time the East Corridor EIS was completed, there were
no plans to include a station along Peña Boulevard between the 40th Ave. & Airport Blvd. • Gateway
Park Station and the Denver Airport Station. However, included in the Intergovernmental Agreement
between RTD and Denver International Airport is a provision that up to two “Gateway Stations” may be
added to the East Corridor along Peña Boulevard. At the time of IGA execution the potential station
locations were understood to be in the general vicinity of 72nd and Dunkirk and 62nd and Peña Boulevard.
In 2014, RTD and DIA concluded negotiations to include one of the potential stations to the East
Corridor at the 62nd and Peña Boulevard location. Since the station was added after the East Corridor
EIS was completed, there was no previous name associated with this station although “Peña Blvd” has
been shown on plans, fact sheets and the website. Through discussions with Denver Transit Partners,
the concessionaire on the Eagle P3 Project, it was determined that a deadline of Dec. 01, 2015 for the
official station name would allow sufficient time to integrate the name into the signage design package,
systems packages for LED and LCD monitor displays, and audio announcements; and operations
documents.
The Board previously approved the station names for the Eagle P3 Project in the December 17, 2013
Board Meeting. Since the negotiations for the addition of the “Gateway Station” were ongoing at the
time, an official station name for the “Gateway Station” was not included for approval in the December
17, 2013 Board Meeting.
After the incorporation of the “Gateway Station” into the Eagle P3 Project, Eagle Project staff and DIA
staff coordinated to develop the recommended station name included in this report. Following that
discussion, the staff recommended the following name:
East Corridor:
Peña Boulevard
In Mid-October 2015, the Eagle Design Team issued an official letter to Denver International Airport to
advise them of the proposed station name and provide them with the opportunity to request an alternate
station name, if deemed appropriate and conforming to all the requirements of the RTD Station Naming
Policy. Denver International Airport also would have to submit a completed RTD Station Naming Form.

Packet Pg. 16

1.B.4

The goal was to avoid a later request from the stakeholder after DTP’s incorporation of the name into
the Eagle P3 Project.
DISCUSSION:
After RTD notified Denver International Airport of the RTD recommended station name, RTD received
confirmation that the RTD staff proposed change was acceptable.
Staff Recommendation: Adopt Peña Boulevard
Staff recommends the acceptance of the name Peña Boulevard for the additional “Gateway Station”.
This name is consistent with current RTD policy and is identified with the geographic location of the
area. This proposed name has been discussed to some length between RTD and DIA staff and the
parties are in agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no negative financial impact to the project at this time. DTP is requiring RTD confirmation of the
official Station Name prior to Dec. 01, 2015, in order to avoid costs that would be incurred with
changing station name after DTP commences with station signage and systems packages. RTD sought
local government input now in order to avoid redesign costs later. Any station name changes after Dec.
01, 2015, could have cost implications to either RTD or stakeholders.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed station name for the additional
“Gateway Station” as follows:
a. Peña Boulevard
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Instead propose an alternative name that is consistent
with the current RTD policy for station names. This is not recommended as it would not be
responsive to previous discussions with a key stakeholder. In addition, it would potentially impact
DTP’ ability to incorporate the station name into the Eagle Project without additional costs to
RTD.

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
Interim General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Local Government Liaison
services with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) to exercise the fourth option year (January 1, 2016 through
December 31, 2016) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a cost of $122,496. Funding for this
contract is included in the annual FasTracks budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Local Government Liaison services was issued on October 20, 2011.
Eight responsive proposals were received for evaluation. Three of the teams were interviewed by a
procurement panel, and a recommendation was subsequently referred to the Executive Committee on
December 15, 2011. The Executive Committee unanimously approved the recommendation that CRL
Associates, Inc. be offered a contract which provided for a one-year base price with four (4) one-year
option periods. The referenced extension covers the fourth and final option period from January 1,
2016 to December 31, 2016. CRL will continue to provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison
services.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the fourth option year ($122,496) are included in the annual budget for the FasTracks
program.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to exercise the fourth option
year (January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016) to extend Contract No. 11-DX-001, at a
cost of $122,496.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to
enter into an agreement to exercise the fourth option year on the contract for the Local
Government Liaison services. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to interested
parties, and a new Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not
recommended because CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with
local government matters in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and
policies.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: NOVEMBER 3, 2015
(current as of October 26)


The House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committee marked up (i.e., debated and
offered amendments to) its multi-year reauthorization legislation on October 22. The bill
provides $55 billion for public transportation programs, with very modest annual growth
(less than 2 percent) in program authorization levels.
o The bill makes few significant changes in public transportation programs, but does
restore a discretionary grant program for bus and bus facility projects and makes
further strides in streamlining environmental and other project approval processes.



Facing the October 29 expiration of surface transportation programs, the House will likely
vote on Tuesday, October 27, on a bill to extend these programs for three weeks, through
November 20, and send this bill to the Senate, where it may meet some opposition.



The extension includes a three-year delay in the deadline for railroads to implement Positive
Train Control (PTC). Senator Barbara Boxer opposes de-coupling the “must-pass” PTC
deadline relief for railroads from the House and Senate long-term transportation bills,
believing the PTC extension is needed to ensure passage of the larger legislation this fall.
Next Steps for the House’s Long-term Bill:


While the T&I Committee approved its six-year reauthorization bill with just seven days to
go until the expiration of the current three-month extension of transportation programs, the
timing of further action on this legislation is uncertain, in part because the bill still lacks a
revenue title to help pay for the programs.



The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to release a revenue title soon that looks
very similar to the Senate DRIVE Act’s, adopted in July. The Senate bill supplements
Highway Trust Fund revenues for three years through a General Fund transfer offset by
spending cuts and revenue increases from sources throughout the Federal budget, with the
remaining three years authorized pending additional revenue. The House bill reported out of
the T&I Committee already includes a similar 3 + 3 year authorization scheme, but lacks
sufficient revenues to fully pay for even the first three years of program authorizations.
Crowded Congressional Calendar:


The House and Senate face a particularly busy schedule, with the election of a new House
Speaker planned for October 29 and efforts to increase the debt limit before November 3.



The budget agreement just reached by Congress and the President will allow for increased
spending for defense and nondefense programs for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and will lift
the debt limit until March 2017. We expect a vote on this budget deal before October 30.



The agreement would offset a portion of the spending increases through selling some of the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This same pay-for was also included in the Senate DRIVE Act
to help fund the first three years of transit and highway programs under that bill. A dollar
can only be spent once, so revenues included as pay-fors in any bill enacted before the surface
transportation bill is passed are no longer available as offsets to pay for transit and highway
program spending.

3.C.1.a

DRAFT POLICY FOR JOINT DEVELOPMENT AND DISPOSITION OF EXCESS PROPERTY:
I. Background and Purpose:
The Regional Transportation District (the “District”) was created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation
system; in establishing the District, the General Assembly found that the system was necessary
for economic development, commerce and the reduction of air pollution. During the course of
implementing the regional transit system, the District has acquired and will in the future
acquire various real property interests for transit related uses. As the District’s needs change
over time, real property once needed for transit purposes may no longer be needed and may
be disposed of, or may be utilized more efficiently and effectively if combined with transit
supportive uses in a joint development project. This policy replaces prior District policies on
disposition and joint development, including Resolution 10, Series of 1984, and Resolution 35,
Series of 2002, and identifies procedures for authorizing the disposition of excess real property,
or the joint development of District real property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has no current or future transit
interest.
3. Fair Market Value: The amount at which property would change hands between a
willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell,
and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.
4. Federal Interest: The dollar amount that is the product of (a) the federal share of total
project costs, and (b)current fair market value of the property, improvements or both,
to the extent the costs of acquiring or improving the property were included as project
costs, or as otherwise provided under current FTA guidance.1
5. Joint Development: A public transportation project that integrally relates to, and often
co-locates with commercial, residential, mixed-use, or other non-transit development.

6. Project Property: Any real property or improvements included in the costs of an FTAassisted project, or as otherwise provided under current Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) guidance.1
7. Permanent Real Property Interest: Fee simple, long-term leasehold of fifty years or
more in duration, or inclusion in a condominium or common interest community.
III. Policy:
1. District Initiated Dispositions or Joint Development:
The following procedures apply when the District initiates a disposition or joint
development of real property.
a. The General Manager and CEO (“GM”) shall review existing Management
Directives, and establish additional administrative processes and procedures as
necessary to plan for the disposition or joint development of District property,
and to secure FTA concurrence for real property matters, where applicable. The
processes and procedures shall define how fair market value is determined. All
property dispositions and/or joint developments shall require Board approval
unless the disposition or joint development meets the delegation of authority
criteria defined below.

b. If the excess real property or the property to be included in a joint development
is configured in a way that it cannot be developed as a stand-alone development
(eg: size, access, etc), and there is a single contiguous property owner with an
interest in acquiring the District property, the District may elect to negotiate
directly with that contiguous property owner.

c. All other joint development and disposition that is initiated by the District shall
be competitively advertised.

2. Unsolicited Proposals for acquisition or joint development of District Property:
The following applies when the District receives a proposal for joint development or a
purchase offer for excess property.
a. External solicitations to acquire excess District property or to enter into a joint
development of District Property shall follow the procedures outlined in the
Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property.
3. Delegation of Authority:
a. Any grant of a permanent real property interest by the District shall be approved
by the RTD Board of Directors, provided, however, that the Board delegates
authority to the GM/CEO to grant the following types of property interests:
i. All access and utility easements across and benefitting RTD property;
ii. Dedications of Right of Way to local jurisdictions;
iii. Non-permanent grants of property interests including but not limited to
temporary construction easements, licenses, and all leases under 7 years
in duration;
iv. All property interests with a fair market value under the GM’s delegated
contracting authority.2
b. This provision does not preclude the GM from seeking a separate delegation of
authority from the Board for specific projects or circumstances, and does not
modify any prior delegations by the Board.
4. Annual Reporting:
a. The GM/ CEO shall provide an annual report to Board summarizing all
permanent property interests granted to third parties during the prior year,
including location of the property, type of interest granted, and value received.
5. Federal Transit Administration requirements:
a. All project property in which there is a federal interest shall follow FTA
requirements before a transfer of that property interest can be completed.
b. If there are conflicts between this policy and any applicable Federal
requirements, the Federal requirements shall govern.

I. Background and Purpose:
The Regional Transportation District (the “District”) was created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation
system; in establishing the District, the General Assembly found that the system was necessary
for economic development, commerce and the reduction of air pollution. In 2010, the District
adopted the Revised Strategic Plan for TOD (Resolution 17 Series of 2010), in order to enhance
the value and effectiveness of transit in the district by increasing ridership, and providing
opportunities for enhanced transit infrastructure. The goal of this policy is to encourage
innovation in leveraging RTD’s real property assets while establishing a consistent process and
transparent criteria for review and acceptance of any unsolicited proposals.
This policy replaces Section 3.4.2 of the Strategic Plan for TOD (revised, 2010) and establishes
policies and procedures for the review of unsolicited proposals from third parties wishing to
acquire excess District Property or proposing a joint development of District Property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has determined there is no current
or future transit interest.
3. Exclusive Negotiation Period: period which is granted to an entity to exclusively
negotiate with RTD staff the terms of a property disposition or joint development prior
to Board approval. During the Exclusive Negotiation Period, the District will not market
the property or consider alternate proposals for disposition or joint development.
4. Fair Market Value: The amount at which property would change hands between a
willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell,
and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.
5. Federal Interest: The dollar amount that is the product of (a) the federal share of total

III. Policy:
A. Purchase Offers for Excess Property:
The following process will govern third party offers to acquire excess District Property.
1. Availability of District Property:
a. The District will maintain a list of excess property which is available for
disposition. Anyone interested in acquiring property from the District, which is
not identified on the excess property list must submit a written inquiry to
determine if the property is available for disposition:

b. Upon receipt of an inquiry, the Real Property and TOD committee will review the
property to determine if there is a current or future transit interest and if the
property is available for disposition.
2. Property Offerings:
a. Upon determining that District property is excess and available for disposition,
the District will conduct a Fair Market Value appraisal of the property. For

concurrence prior to disposition.
b. Upon completion of an FMV appraisal and receipt of FTA concurrence (if
required), the District will set a minimum offering price, and post notice soliciting
offers for acquisition of the excess property.
i. Notice will be posted using the District’s standard solicitation methods, as
well as in a regional real estate journal such as the Colorado Real Estate
Journal, or similar journal in circulation at the time.
c. Excess property is offered AS IS. It is the District’s expectation that for unsolicited
offers to acquire excess property, the offeror will bear all costs associated with
the acquisition including title commitments, survey costs, environmental due
diligence and appraisal costs.
3. Direct Negotiations with Offeror:
a. The District may choose to negotiate directly with a contiguous property owner,
if the excess property is:
i. configured in a way that it cannot be developed as a stand-alone
development (eg: size, access, etc)
AND
ii. there is no other contiguous property owner with an interest in acquiring
the District property.
4. Board Approval:
a. Unless otherwise delegated, all dispositions must be approved by the RTD Board
of Directors.
B. Offer for Joint Development of District Property:
The following process will govern third party offers for joint development of District Property.
1. Joint Development Proposal Submission Requirements:
a. Anyone interested in pursuing a joint development project that includes District
Property should submit a written proposal to :
