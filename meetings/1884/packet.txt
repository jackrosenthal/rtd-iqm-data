RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors appoint one
member to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to
fill a vacancy on the Committee.
BACKGROUND
The seventeen-member FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) advises the District on matters
relating to the implementation of the voter approved FasTracks program, and performs such additional
duties as requested by RTD. The Committee serves in an advisory capacity through the designated
liaison to the Board of Directors, staff and project consultants
Committee member Steve Lawrence submitted his resignation from the CAC effective February 19,
2014, due to his pending deployment with the Peace Corps.
Recruitment for citizens interested in serving on the CAC was publicly advertised through the RTD Web
site, a news release sent to stakeholders, local publications and electronic broadcast media lists totaling
1,541 recipients, current CAC members for distribution to their networks, and through other distribution
channels. Applicants were asked to submit a one-page letter stating their interest in serving on the CAC
along with specific qualifications, highlights of related experience and expertise and a resume if
available. Forty applications were received by the deadline.
The Nominating Committee, composed of two Board members and two Assistant General Managers,
carefully reviewed each application received in order to fill vacant positions at the end of 2013, and to
identify alternates should a vacancy occur during 2014, considering criteria outlined in the Committee
Structure adopted by the Board in 2005, including:






Broad representation of stakeholder interests
Diversity
Demonstrated interest in public transit and/or the FasTracks program
Previous community service
Professional experience.

The following applicant was identified as the first alternate and is recommended for appointment to fill
the remaining portion of Mr. Lawrence’s term expiring on December 31, 2014:
Hannah Polow is a Transportation Planner at Boulder County Transportation. She has worked on projects
such as bike storage along the BOLT route on the Diagonal Highway; encouraging secondary school
students to travel to school in a sustainable manner; the county's transportation master plan; working
with architects to create a successful transportation plan at a human services building; and responding

Packet Pg. 5

2.11.A

to bicycle issues related to the September 2013 flood. Her personal attention to transportation issues
started as a college student at CU-Boulder—especially how to combine transit with other modes. She
got her Bachelor's from CU-Boulder and holds a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA.
She works all over Boulder County and is a resident of Boulder, RTD District O.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors appoint one new member to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory
Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to fill a vacancy on the Committee.
2. Modify the recommended appointments to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee. This is
not recommended as the identification of an alternate followed an extensive public application
process and is within the parameters of the Committee Structure adopted by the RTD Board of
Directors.
3. Do not adopt the Recommended Action. This is not recommended as this alternative would delay
the appointment process of the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee.

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the City and County of Denver
(CCD) for the Free MetroRide

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver (CCD), for the maintenance of
roadway and street furniture improvements constructed for the operation of the Free MetroRide,
formerly known as the Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator).
BACKGROUND
The Free MetroRide will be a high-frequency bus service that will transport passengers between Denver
Union Station and the Civic Center area. The Monday to Friday, peak rush hours (6-9 a.m. and 3-6
p.m.) headway will be 5-6 minutes. There are no current plans to provide weekend, mid-day or evening
service, however, this could change depending on ridership and funding availability. Service from
Denver Union Station will travel southeast on 19th Street, turn south onto Broadway and then east onto
16th Avenue at Civic Center. From Civic Center, the route continues east on 16th Avenue, north onto
Lincoln Street, and then northwest onto 18th Street to Denver Union Station. The Free MetroRide will
supplement RTD’s Free Mall Ride, which runs on the 16th Street Mall, and like the Mall shuttle, will be
free and uniquely branded.
DISCUSSION
RTD designed, funded, and is currently constructing 13 uniquely branded Free MetroRide bus stops.
Nine bus stops will be street-side, and four will be at bus islands that will extend beyond existing streetside curbs. Each Free MetroRide stop will have a concrete bus stopping pad, custom route markers and
nine stops will have canopies. The bus islands will also have custom seating bollards and planters. 18 th
Street is a City designated bicycle route. The bicycle lanes, as needed, will be located between the bus
island and existing street-side curbs. The customized elements at the Free MetroRide stops and the
bicycle lanes require a repair and maintenance IGA with CCD that clarifies responsibilities.
The IGA includes the following provisions for constructing and maintaining transit improvements within
CCD’s right-of-way. If approved, it becomes retroactively effective on November 1, 2013. Key
provisions of the IGA include the following:
1. RTD to maintain and repair four bus islands, all shelter canopies, street furnishings at all stops, and
the bicycle lane concrete and pavement markings located between the bus islands and street-side
curbs.
2. Annual payments of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) to CCD for maintenance, snow removal, and
cleaning of bicycle lane segments located at the bus islands.
3. RTD shall repair the bicycle lanes, as needed for the four segments located at bus islands, and shall

Packet Pg. 7

2.11.B

also maintain the bicycle lane pavement markings in those same locations.
4. Major encumbrance permits and fees will be waived by CCD.
5. Any construction moratorium on 19th Street and 16th Avenue will be eliminated by CCD.
6. CCD agrees not to charge RTD for the parking meters.
7. The IGA also addresses provisions for its possible termination and future cost shares.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. RTD shall provide an annual amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) to CCD for the
maintenance, snow removal, and cleaning of bicycle lane segments located at the bus islands,
commencing in 2014.
2. If CCD’s necessary and reasonable annual expenses for maintenance are greater or less than an
average of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) for 2014 and 2015, RTD’s annual payment shall be
adjusted accordingly. Invoices shall be provided by CCD to RTD by April 1, 2016. For each
subsequent two-year period thereafter, while this IGA is in effect, RTD’s annual payment shall be
increased or decreased accordingly to actual costs. RTD’s annual payments shall be due on July 1 of
each year.
3. Roadway and street furniture construction costs were included in a separate on-call FasTracks
contract for the current amount of $2.4M, which includes a 35% DBE goal. In addition, 12 buses
were purchased for this project at a cost of $8,389,343.00.
4. Approximately 15 construction employees are being utilized for the work.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver
(CCD), for the maintenance of roadway and street furniture improvements constructed for the
operation of the Free MetroRide, formerly known as the Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This would impact the
operation of the Free MetroRide , causing inconvenience to the public. The stop improvements are
currently under construction. The Free MetroRide is a component of the FasTracks plan, and is
needed to support the Free MetroRide service that has been established.
3. Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it would cause
inconvenience to the public. Market Street Station bus operations will move to DUS on May 11,
2014. Moving passengers between DUS and Civic Center provides a significant downtown
connection, which is crucial for RTD’s operations and its patrons.

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: February 13, 2014

Subject:

May 2014 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2014 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost increase of approximately $1,440,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager
or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. With the
opening of the Union Station Bus Concourse a service plan has been developed; rerouting existing bus
service from the former Market Street Station to the new underground Bus Concourse facility at Denver
Union Station. Additionally, the Free MetroRide is a new service proposed for the downtown Denver
area. The Free Metro Ride would provide additional distribution/circulation service during peak periods to
supplement the existing Free Mall Ride service. Service changes not associated with or included in the
Denver Union Station Service Plan are also proposed to maintain system on-time performance and
provide the appropriate level of service according to customer demand. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of Union Station Service Plan service and propose adjustments as
appropriate.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate impacts on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two public hearings were held on January 29, 2014 where the primary subject was the opening of the
Denver Union Station Bus Concourse. Comments from these meetings and the service change website
are summarized in Attachment B of this report. It should be noted that three public hearings were held in
November 2013 to discuss the initial bus service plan for the opening of the DUS Bus Concourse.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the

Packet Pg. 10

2.11.C

outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the

2.11.C.b

This meeting was attended by 23 members of the public and RTD Board members Director Bill James
and Director Natalie Menten. RTD staff in attendance included: Robert Rynerson, Jeff Becker, Jessie
Carter, Doug Monroe, Chris Marko, and Diane Marquiss.
The comments from public largely centered on the proposal affecting the area around 18th Street
between Wazee and Wynkoop Streets accessing the DUS bus concourse. It was the view of those who
spoke that the routing was a burden unfairly placed on the residents in the area. The attendees
suggested alternative routings be studied to provide a more equitable distribution of the bus traffic
going into DUS. It was pointed out that pedestrian safety along with parking access were of great
concern.
Other comments were heard in favor of changes made to the Route 9 and comments made on behalf of
riders of late night/early light rail service.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: January 29, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 29, 2014

Board Meeting Date: February 13, 2014

Subject:

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the City and County of Denver
(CCD) for a share of the 16th Street
Maintenance (Blocks 1-13)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or designee, to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
with the City and County of Denver (CCD) for the shared maintenance cost of the 13 block portion
of the 16 th Street Mall between Broadway and Market Street. This IGA commits both RTD and CCD
to share the cost of maintaining the granite pavers, curbs and transition stones within the
transitway.
BACKGROUND
The 16 th Street Mall transitway, which is used by the RTD shuttle bus, has been maintained by RTD
since the early 1980’s. This does not include maintenance by RTD the adjacent walkways, center
medians or intersections. Recent annual maintenance costs have risen significantly. RTD has also,
over the last 30 plus years, procured granite replacement pavers on an as needed basis for only the
transitway. Maintenance has included repairing or replacing granite pavers, grouted joints, setting
bed and the concrete sub-slab. RTD had at one time participated in tree replacements. This phase of
maintenance was discontinued by RTD during the mid-2000’s.
DISCUSSION
At meetings with CCD staff since late 2012 and through 2013, it has been determined that a cost
share with CCD would be appropriate. The cost for maintaining the walkways, medians and trees
will be further coordinated between CCD and the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP), and will not
include RTD. In the interest of providing a more equitable cost sharing the City and County of
Denver has supported a plan to split the cost of maintenance: 30% for CCD and 70% for RTD. The
estimated annual maximum maintenance cost for 2014 – 2016 is $950,000.00 per year for a total
maximum estimate of $2,850,000, which was used to establish the value of RTD’s current three year
option contract with Gallegos Masonry Construction. If this IGA is approved, CCD will reimburse RTD a
value of 30% of RTD’s annual expenditures, up to a maximum value of $300,000.00 annually.
RTD’s share will be the remaining 70% of the annual maintenance cost. RTD will take the lead in
providing design, construction management and cost control of this work, including sending invoices
to CCD. All direct procurement, construction and inspection costs, with the exception of
management expenses, will be reimbursable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This IGA commits financial obligations by RTD and CCD. Implementation of this IGA implies future
financial commitments by RTD and CCD, subject to future RTD Board of Direc tors and Denver City
Council approvals. The resultant financial obligations are subject to each agency’s legally required
budgeting, authorization and appropriation process. Nothing in the IGA shall be construed as a
multiple fiscal year obligation by either party.

Packet Pg. 29

2.12.D

1. CCD will reimburse RTD 30% of the actual maintenance cost, up to $300,000.00 annually.
2. RTD will provide the remaining 70%.
The current year’s maintenance value for RTD’s share is included in RTD’s approved 2014 budget.
The estimated construction workforce is ten employees.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to enter
into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver (CCD) for the
shared maintenance cost of the 13 block portion of the 16 th Street Mall between Broadway and
Market Street. This IGA commits both RTD and CCD to share the cost of maintaining the granite
pavers, curbs and transition stones within the transitway.
2. Delay implementing the Recommended Action: This is not recommended because delaying the
implementation of the IGA would require that RTD renegotiate the IGA terms.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. If the IGA is not implemented, RTD would have to bear
the entire cost of the 16 th Street Mall transitway maintenance, and RTD would not receive CCD’s
share of the maintenance. The result would be a higher RTD maintenance cost.

Board Meeting Date: February 13, 2014

Subject:

Contract Award for the District Shops HRU
Project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible
bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of $2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit
(HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be made from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the
project budget in the amount of $322,103.
BACKGROUND
The scope of the District Shops HRU project is to replace 16 HRU’s that are beyond their useful life with
new units. The existing units were installed when the building was constructed in 1989. The 100%
outside air HRU’s provide gas heating, evaporative cooling, and energy recovery. The units exhaust
100% of the air supplied. The energy recovery section tempers incoming air to cool it in the summer and
warms it in the winter using energy absorbed from the exhaust air process.
DISCUSSION
The project was advertised on September 30, 2013. The pre-bid conference was held on October 15,
2013 and the bids were received on October 29, 2013 as follows:
1. JCOR - $2,669,400
2. Legacy - $2,733,500
DBE INVOLVEMENT
The DBE goal was advertised at 7% with JCOR meeting the goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the project is included in the 2014 approved budget. With the transfer the construction
budget will be $2,669,400: $1,877,837.20 from federal grant CO-04-0043 with $469,459.80 of local
match and $257,682.40 from the State of Good Repair (SOGR) grant with $64,420.60 of local match.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager,or his designee, to award a
contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit (HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be
made from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of $322,103.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit (HRU) project. Also, do not authorize a

Packet Pg. 31

2.12.E

transfer from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of
$322,103. Project shall be rebid. This is not recommended as the bids are considered competitive,
and delay may result in the loss of grant funds.
3. Do nothing. Cancel project and redirect funds. This is not recommended as the project has been fully
designed and the existing units are beyond their useful life and need replacement. Additionally, any
delay may result in the loss of grant funds.

Board Meeting Date: February 13, 2014

Subject:

Transfer of Funds from Light Rail Capital to
Light Rail Expense

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve the transfer of $703,000 in approved 2014
capital to an expense line to facilitate the development of revised Light Rail Vehicle specifications.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the 2014 budget at the November 2013 meeting. One of the
capital projects approved at that meeting was funding to purchase Track Maintenance Equipment for the
Maintenance of Way Division of Rail Operations.
Since that time we have determined that in order to move forward with the purchase of new Light Rail
Vehicles scheduled for 2015 we need to develop a revised specification.
DISCUSSION
In order to develop a revised specification we need to get outside assistance from LTK, doing business
FRSC, as we have in the past. This will require a transfer of funds from capital to expense to fund the
work order on a contract that already exists.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This transfer will not create a financial impact to the district since it is a transfer from capital to
expense. It will have a zero effect on the current approved budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
The DBE requirements were satisfied when the current agreement with LTK (FRSC) was approved.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to approve this transfer in order to
develop a revised specification for Light Rail Vehicles to be ordered in 2015.
2. Do not authorize the transfer which will cause a delay in the purchase of Light Rail Vehicles
which have been scheduled for 2015.

Access-a-Ride Budget Transfer

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer in the amount of $5,271,915 to re-allocate previously approved Access-aRide 2014 funding from budget accounts associated with the expired Access-a-Ride service provider
contracts to budget accounts associated with the new Access-a-Ride service provider contracts.
BACKGROUND
The 2014 Access-a-Ride budget was prepared in mid-2013 and was based on the Access-a-Ride service
provider model that was in effect at that time. This model included four (4) dedicated-vehicle service
providers. In late-2013, the Access-a-Ride service provider contracts were re-bid and in November of
2013, the Board of Directors approved the award of the Access-a-Ride service provider contract to three
(3) dedicated-vehicle and one (1) non-dedicated-vehicle service providers. As a result, the 2014
approved budget funds for Access-a-Ride need to be re-allocated to the service providers chosen to
provide service in the new Access-a-Ride contract. The Board of Directors approved the 2014 budget at
the November 2013 meeting.
DISCUSSION
The total budget dollars being transferred, or re-allocated, is $5,271,915. This budget transfer will result
in some budget line items being reduced and others being increased, and the net effect on the 2014
budget is zero.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This transfer will have no impact on the approved 2014 budget because it is simply a re-allocation of
previously approved funds.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the budget transfer as recommended in order to proceed with the contract awards.
2. Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will cause a
delay in the processing of the Access-a-Ride service provider contracts for 2014.

Access-a-Cab Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to extend
Agreements with Metro Taxi, Yellow Cab, and Union Taxi Inc., to provide Access-a-Cab services. In
addition, as long as the program remains successful and beneficial to RTD, the General Manager, or his
designee, is hereby authorized to negotiate and enter into agreements with each participating cab
company for three (3) years with two 1-year options.
BACKGROUND
In March of 1997, the RTD Board of Directors introduced the Access-a-Cab program to our Access-aRide program participants. The program offers flexibility in transportation services for individuals with
disabilities. Passengers are permitted to schedule same day trips with local taxi cab companies. Local
taxi companies currently participating include Yellow Transportation, Union Taxi, and Metro Taxi.
DISCUSSION
The subsidized Access-a-Cab program has proven to be very popular. Trips that are taken using the
Access-a-Cab service involve a lesser RTD subsidy per ride than trips taken on the regular Access-aRide service. All persons using Access-a-Cab are certified as eligible to use our Paratransit service,
Access-a-Ride. The budget for 2014 is as follows: Metro Taxi, $1,200,000, Yellow Cab, $800,000,
and Union Taxi Inc., $150,000. Funding for the Access-a-Cab is budgeted annually based on ridership
and anticipated demand. The Board will have the opportunity to review these contracts every 3-5 years.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the Access-a-Cab service are included in the 2014 approved budget. Funds for Access-a-Cab
service in future years will be requested as part of future budget processes.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended continuance of Agreements for the Access-a-Cab program.
2. Do not approve the continuance of Agreements for the Access-a-Cab program. This is not
recommended as it will increase overall subsidy costs for our programs to serve individuals with
disabilities.

RTD Funding of DUSPA Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to contribute the 2012 $3.3 million working capital advance to the
Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) towards completion of the Denver Union Station project
and relieve the related receivable as of December 31, 2013.
BACKGROUND
The Denver Union Station Project Authority is constructing the $480 million Denver Union Station
redevelopment project which is funded through a combination of federal loans, state and federal grants,
land sale proceeds, an RTD bond, and FasTracks funds. When the $480 million project is completed, all
project elements will belong to RTD. To date RTD has contributed approximately $222.8 million, which
is comprised of a $168 million RTD Bond and a combination of FasTracks-funded project planning,
oversight and change order costs.
The Denver Union Station (DUS) project is comprised of multiple elements. The light rail plaza opened in
May 2012 and the underground bus complex will open to the public on May 9, 2014. The project is a
key element for the FasTracks vision and will be the central multi-modal hub of the RTD transit system.
It will be recognized as the “Grand Central Station” of the metropolitan area in the heart of the city.
Through its 22 bus bays and light rail and commuter rail platforms the station is designed to
accommodate up to 10,000 people per hour.
DISCUSSION
In March 2012, the RTD Board of Directors authorized an advance of up to $6 million in funds to the
Denver Union Station Project Authority. This advance was authorized to provide working capital to the
project since DUSPA’s funding sources could only be accessed on a reimbursement basis after
expenditures had been made. In December 2012, RTD advanced approximately $3.3 million from Block
A land sale proceeds of the authorized $6 million. Of the $3.3 million advance, DUSPA used $1 million
to convert the Tail Tracks Plaza to a platform walkway and sitting area. The remaining funds were used
to build Wynkoop Plaza.
When the $3.3 million advance was made in December 2012, RTD recorded the $3.3 million as a
receivable from DUSPA to indicate that the funds were anticipated to be paid back at a future date. In
addition, an allowance for $3.3 million dollars was recorded in the event that DUSPA would be unable to
repay these funds. An allowance is required under conservative accounting principles when the
possibility of an inability to repay exists. The project has a fixed amount of funding available for project
completion and there was some uncertainty of remaining costs at the time. This method of accounting
effectively offsets the receivable leaving no future negative impact to RTD’s fund balances.
As the project approaches completion, it is clear that all funds DUSPA has received are needed to
complete the project. If DUSPA were to repay the advance to RTD, DUSPA would have to borrow those
funds, thereby incurring interest and increasing the project cost to RTD. After careful consideration,

Packet Pg. 41

2.12.I

staff has determined that contributing the $3.3 million to the project and relieving the receivable would
be the best course of action. With an effective date of December 31 2013, we would remove the
receivable and its allowance from RTD’s balance sheet while showing the $3.3 million invested in the
RTD owned capital asset.
In the future, RTD may realize a financial benefit to compensate for the additional $3.3 million project
funding from the possible early retirement of DUSPA’s debt. DUSPA’s debt obligations are funded
through tax increment financing (TIF) generated from property, sales and lodging taxes in the DUS taxing
district as well as the RTD bond. Due to accelerated development in the TIF district, DUSPA is currently
receiving TIF revenues at a rate higher than originally forecasted in the financial plan. These excess TIF
revenues will be applied toward the early payment of outstanding principal on DUSPA’s TIFIA and RRIF
loans. If these two loans are repaid before RTD meets the entirety of the RTD bond payment schedule
(approximately $12 million per year for 30 years) RTD’s bond obligations to DUSPA will cease at that
time. Because DUSPA would not have to borrow the $3.3 million, this has the potential of saving RTD
at least $3.3 million in future bond payments.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Because the receivable allowance was recorded in 2012, there will be no financial impact. Approval of
this action item would simply result in a financial statement entry at December 31, 2013.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the staff recommendation to authorize the General Manager to contribute the $3.3 million
working capital advance to the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) towards completion of
the Denver Union Station project and relieve the related receivable.
2. Do not approve the staff recommendation and wait until project close-out to see if DUSPA has funds
to repay RTD. This is not the recommended action because it is unlikely that there will be funds
remaining which would cause DUSPA to borrow additional funds thereby increasing the cost to RTD.
3. Do not approve staff recommendation and seek repayment options through alternate means.
