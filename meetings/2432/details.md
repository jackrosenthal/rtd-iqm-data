#### 1. RTD Director District Precinct Assignment

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the revised Director District boundary between Director District F and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 356 falls within Director District G, where a majority of the precinct already lies. This alternative would affect the fewest number of households.

Motion:              Chair Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 16, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Lasater asked staff to make sure they notify the county to make sure the proper ballots were sent to the proper Districts.  He shared that when he was running for the Board last year there was an issue and a special ballot had to be sent to the people who were moved to District G.

Paula Perdue, Executive Director to the Board of Directors, agreed with Director Lasater.  She stated this is a major issue as RTD goes into an election year.  She explained that once this was approved by the Board, staff would be working with the counties, Secretary of State, etc. to follow the proper notification procedures.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. RTD Boundary Certification and Director District Designation

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the revised boundary map of the District and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and description.  It is further recommended that the areas newly annexed to RTD pursuant to the provisions of CRS 32-9-106 be designated as follows:

a.       The two Erie annexations – the Spallone No. 5 Annexation and the Andalusia Annexation – are recommended to be included in Director District I (Director Lubow); and

b.       The Parker annexation – Todd Drive – is recommended to be included in Director District G (Director Lasater).

Motion:              Director Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 16, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Solano wondered how many people would be added to Districts I and G as a result of these annexations.  Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, stated that in the case of the annexations in Parker (District G) it would just be adding right-of-way.  He said in Erie (District I) one of the annexations was vacant and the other was very small but he did not know the exact number of people it contained.  Committee Chair James noted the number of people added would be quite small.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. Pass Program Study Update

Michael Washington, Title VI Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation that is available in the February 2, 2016 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.  He reminded the Board that in September, 2015 the Board committed to convene an RTD and Stakeholder Pass Program Working Group with approval of the EcoPass fare changes.  He said the pass programs that would be reviewed by the working group include both the individual passes (Day, Month and Valu) as well as the group rate passes (Eco, Flex and College).

Michael Washington outlined the guiding principles of the working group as established by staff as follows:

- Increase Ridership

- Meet SBP Revenue Targets

- Provide RTD Revenue Certainty

- Improve Customer Convenience

- Promote Greater Brand Loyalty

- Simplify Passenger-Operator Interaction

- Cost Effective Administration

- Sustain Equitable Access

Michael Washington indicated that the first step of the study process would be to finalize the pass program objectives and guiding principles with input from the Board.  A facilitator and technical consultant would be hired prior to assembling and engaging stakeholder groups and developing policy recommendations.

Director Folska stated that she finds the pass program to be very complicated.  She can understand why staff feels like they need help; however, she is not inclined to support hiring an outside facilitator and technical consultant.  She pointed out that staff has been working on the fare for over a year.  What RTD needs is a low income fare as there is already a Day Pass, Eco Pass, etc.  She feels this is redundant.

Director Menten suggesting holding off on looking to hire a facilitator until February of 2017 so that there is a full year’s worth of data on the current pass programs.  She does not think there is enough data at this time for an accurate evaluation.  She wonders what else can be done to let people know that they need to be tapping their badge as the people she speaks with still do not know what they need to do.  She thinks this is premature.  She stated that she is not fond of spending money on a facilitator, especially when it is too early in the process.

Director Lubow shared that she does not have an opinion one way or the other about hiring a facilitator.  What she is interested in is helping low income individuals have better access to our discounts.  She said the Board has been listening for two years about how much they need help.  She said that the Board and staff have seen through the Affordable Fares Task Force that our programs do not go far enough.  Director Lubow expressed that she would like to see people from the Affordable Fares Task Force be included in the Pass Program Working Group.  She thanked staff for being willing to work on these important issues.

Director Solano does not believe we need to hire a new facilitator and technical consultant.  He stated that staff has been looking at our fares and pass programs for quite a while.  He hopes that staff can conduct an analysis of what the new fare structure has done both positively and negatively but he reiterated that we do not need to hire someone.  He agrees with Director Lubow on the importance of helping our low income riders.

Director Francone indicated that she was disappointed with this presentation as she thought staff was going to be presenting the Board with information on a low income pass program.  She echoed the thoughts of Directors Folska and Menten.  She thought RTD was done studying the pass programs with the implementation of the fare increase in January.  She stated that one way or the other she would like to see something with respect to a low income fare program.

Chair Tobiassen believes that there are many stakeholders that are interested in reviewing the passes that are important to them.  He said it is his expectation that in reviewing these passes a low income pass would be incorporated at the same time.  He stated that it is important that this process is extremely transparent because RTD is dealing with taxpayer money.  He said it is also important that the cost of these programs does not have an impact of the level of service provided.  RTD cannot cut routes or maintenance to support pass programs.  Chair Tobiassen stressed the importance of receiving public input on all the pass programs.

Director Walker expressed that this is a huge, gargantuan effort because there are so many forces at work that make our fares unaffordable.  He feels it would be beneficial to have an outline of factors affecting the low income.  He thinks it is prudent to hire a consultant so RTD is removed from the issue since it affects RTD directly.  He said that so far he likes what staff is presenting.  He recognized that it will grow and change and morph but this is a good first step.

Director Hoy believes that RTD has a pretty robust Non-Profit program right now.  He pointed out that RTD allocates millions of taxpayer dollars to this program.  He said it was his understanding that typically some of that money goes unused.  He commented that there are groups that could go through the process to become eligible but do not.  He feels that until the system in place is expended he does not think there is a great deal of incentive to throw taxpayer money at a similar system.  He encourages continued dialog but is not enthusiastic about the direction.

Director Folska stated that she does not want staff to have the impression that she is not supportive of streamlining our passes and getting public feedback; however, she hopes there is not any redundancy in doing what has already been done.  She stated that she is still waiting for the customer satisfaction survey that RTD paid $1.4 million for and it has been over two years.  She thinks staff can look at data we already have obtained in this analysis.

Director Menten said it was her understanding that the Stakeholder Pass Program Working Group was created because there were people who felt that the cost of the EcoPasses jumped forward to quickly.  She stated this Working Group has nothing to do with low income fares.  She asked if she was wrong.  Michael Washington stated she was not.

Director Anderson said that it was her understanding that this is coming up because there was a Title VI issue.  She expressed that she does not want to open up things like the Day Pass that have already been settled.  She agrees with Director Menten that there needs to be a year’s worth of data before there can be proper analysis.  She understands people in Boulder want more input in the EcoPasses but she does not want to go through all of our passes again.  She said that as far as a low income pass is concerned, the Board continually hears about many things that do not apply to transit like wage inequality, housing, etc.  She stated that those are issues that need to be addressed by the US Congress and our State Legislature.  The role of RTD is to provide transit.  She agrees with Chair Tobiassen that routes should not be cut to give someone a free or discounted pass.

Director Lubow shared that she has been in touch with Boulder County Transportation who was concerned about the EcoPass costs increasing much more than the other passes.  She noted that they have told her they are very interested in making sure there is a low income piece to whatever analysis is done on passes.

Interim General Manager Genova explained that the Stakeholder Pass Program Working Group will be looking at RTD’s existing pass programs.  RTD made the commitment to form this group when the EcoPass pricing was approved in 2015.  He stated that this would not look at the fare structure, just the passes.  He stressed that staff will continue to meet with the Affordable Fares Task Force.  He said that as the Board is aware, the major issue is to find a sustained funding source.

Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that the Title VI issue was addressed when the EcoPasses were increased by 18%.  Marla Lien pointed out that the Board has not adopted the guiding principles that were outlined in the presentation.  She understands that the Board is feeling a little pass and fare fatigue; however, staff is trying to be proactive in establishing the guiding principles so staff has a place to work from going forward.  The Board can elect to add more principles about affordability, access, etc.

Interim General Manager Genova agrees with comments that had been made that it will be important to have a year’s worth of data, especially with the new fares and five openings.  He recognized that this would be a charged topic which is why staff is recommending a facilitator.  He shared that staff has heard from many stakeholders that they would like one as well.  He explained that hiring a facilitator and technical consultant brings an unbiased third-party into the analysis.

Committee Chair James thinks RTD should keep the momentum going on aggressively analyzing what we are doing in a balanced, transparent way.  He thanked staff for the update.

Director Lubow thanked Marla Lien for her explanation of the importance of looking at the passes.  She said she would like the last guiding principle to read “sustain and promote equitable access” rather than just “sustain equitable access”.

Interim General Manager Genova thanked Director Lubow for the input.  He encouraged the other Board members to send their input to Michael Washington for incorporation into the guiding principles and objectives.

Michael Washington introduced Shantel Lewis, the new Title VI Specialist, that was just added to the team.
