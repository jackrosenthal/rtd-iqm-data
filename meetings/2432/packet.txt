BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: January 27, 2016

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

January 27, 2016

Subject:

RTD Director District Precinct Assignment

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: February 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
revised Director District boundary between Director District F and Director District G so that all of
Arapahoe County Precinct Number 356 falls within Director District G, where a majority of the precinct
already lies. This alternative would affect the fewest number of households.
BACKGROUND
On February 21, 2012, in accordance with CRS 32-9-111(1)(a), the Board approved a revised Director
District map to reflect changes in the District’s population as reflected in the 2010 Census. The
redistricting process required that, among other things, the individual Director Districts would be
comprised of whole general election precincts, as established by the boards of county commissioners of
those counties wholly or partially within the district and by the election commission of the City and
County of Denver and the City and County of Broomfield.
From time to time, the individual counties adjust precinct boundaries. Typically, the adjusted precincts
remain completely within individual Director Districts; however, Arapahoe County has adjusted its
precincts so that Precinct Number 356, all of which was previously in Director District G (Director
Lasater), now falls across the boundary of District G into District F (Director Tobiassen). See attached
map. A vast majority of the precinct remains in District G. The precinct in question lies slightly west of
South Powhatan Street, north of County Line Road. In order to change the Director District boundaries,
the Board must take action.
DISCUSSION
CRS 32-9-111(1)(a) states the following: “No general election precinct may be split into two or more
director districts.” Arapahoe County’s new precinct map places Precinct Number 356 over the boundary
of District F (Director Tobiassen) and District G (Director Lasater). In order to conform to statute, the
Board must adjust the Director District boundaries so that the new precinct lies exclusively in one
Director District. If the Director District boundaries were adjusted to follow the new precinct line, District
G would become marginally larger; conversely, Director District F would become marginally smaller. If
all of Precinct Number 356 is placed in Director District G, it appears that the adjustment would impact
only one household, which would become part of Director District G from District F. An alternative
option would be to expand Director District F to encompass the entirety of Precinct Number 356, which
would then expand that Director District to now include approximately 100 additional households that
were previously part of Director District G.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial associated with this action.

ALTERNATIVES
1.

Accept the Recommended Action by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the revised Director District boundary between Director District F and Director
District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 356 falls within Director District G,
where a majority of the precinct already lies. This alternative would affect the fewest number of
households.

2.

Do not accept the Recommended Action by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors and do not approve the revised Director District boundary between Director
District F and Director District G so that all of Arapahoe County Precinct Number 356 falls within
Director District G, where a majority of the precinct already lies. Instead, the Board could expand
Director District F to encompass the entirety of Precinct Number 356, which would expand that
Director District to now include approximately 100 additional households.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: January 28, 2016

From:

Subject:

RTD Boundary Certification
District Designation

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: February 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
revised boundary map of the District and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and
description. It is further recommended that the areas newly annexed to RTD pursuant to the provisions
of CRS 32-9-106 be designated as follows:
a. The two Erie annexations – the Spallone No. 5 Annexation and the Andalusia Annexation
– are recommended to be included in Director District I (Director Lubow); and
b. The Parker annexation – Todd Drive – is recommended to be included in Director District G
(Director Lasater).

BACKGROUND
In 1994, the Colorado legislature approved a bill to allow the annexation of land into RTD concurrent
with annexation into a municipality if any part or all of that municipality was in the District boundaries.
As new areas enter the district via municipal annexation, the newly annexed areas must be assigned to a
specific Director District. The Board must approve the designation of those areas to be in specific
Director Districts.
DISCUSSION
In December 2015, RTD found that three annexations had occurred whereby the District Boundary
would expand as follows: two annexations were made by the Town of Erie; the third was made by the
Town of Parker. Since these newly annexed areas have not been assigned to specific director districts,
Board action will be required. The two Erie annexations – the Spallone No. 5 Annexation and the
Andalusia Annexation – are directly adjacent to Director District I (Director Lubow). The Parker
annexation – Todd Drive – is directly adjacent to District G (Director Lasater). Since each of the three
annexations directly connects to only one Director District, it appears appropriate that those areas are
assigned to the connecting Director District. The attached maps depict the annexed areas and the
adjacent director districts to which staff recommends they be assigned.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is anticipated with the requested action.
