Committee Chair Walker turned the meeting over to Marla Lien, General Counsel, for a brief update.  Marla Lien informed the Board that earlier in the day the Denver District Court had a preliminary injunction hearing over the lawsuit to stop House Bill 1272, which provided sales and use tax parity between the State and RTD.  The plaintiff had requested there be a preliminary injunction which was denied.  This means that the Department of Revenue will now be collecting taxes per the new legislation.  Marla Lien stressed that this was just a preliminary injunction hearing; there may still be discovery and a trial but the judge will be trying to do this in an accelerated fashion.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan Update (Howerter/Rael & Letson)

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, reminded the Board that each year they present an actuary report for the Salaried Employees’ Pension Trust.   He introduced Terry Bright of Rael and Letson, RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Pension Trust Actuaries and Benefit Consultants.  He also recognized Stephen Weinstein, RTD’s attorney representing the trust council.

Terry Bright reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the January 14, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  He noted that if all actuarial assumptions are met each year the plan will reach full funding in 2031.

Terry Howerter asked Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, to explain how the Government Accounting Standards Board’s (GASB) new standards will affect RTD.

Doug MacLeod stated that GASB issued pronouncement 68 (GASB 68) which applies to RTD’s financial reporting in fiscal year 2015.  He explained that GASB 68 requires governmental agencies with defined benefit pension plans to report pension liabilities differently than current requirements; currently, GASB requires RTD to report in its financial statement a liability for its net pension obligation (NPO).  An NPO is simply the amount to date that has not been funded to meet pension obligations and assumes that future payments to the pension will make up for the current or future shortfalls.    Doug MacLeod stated that GASB 68 will require RTD to report the unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) rather than the NPO.  The UAAL is the underfunded amount assuming the current payment and investment returns continue and additional funds are not paid into the pension to eliminate the shortfall.

Doug MacLeod explained that recording a liability in the financial statements such as the UAAL has the effect of reducing the fund balance, which is the amount of net assets available for RTD’s use.  If RTD was to early adopt that pronouncement in 2013 the current additional liability that we would have to recognize is an additional $8.8 million dollars.  Doug MacLeod noted that this is a relatively small amount and staff believes RTD can absorb this without a problem.

Director Folska asked what might be the origin of GASB 68.  Doug MacLeod stated that is has evolved from the fact that many defined benefits plans have seen their UAALs increase at many cities, municipalities, etc.   He commented that the full liability owned was not shown under the old standard so this was how the GASB is addressing the growing liabilities being accurately reflected.

#### 2. Represented Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan Update (Howerter/Gabriel Roeder Smith)

Terry Howerter stated that staff wanted to review the RTD/ATU 1001 Pension Plan actuary report with the Board as pronouncements 67 and 68 will have some significant impacts on RTD’s financial reporting.  He introduced Leslie Thompson, Actuary from Gabriel Roder Smith & Company.

Leslie Thompson reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the January 14, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  She stressed to the Board that Plan funding is in peril; reforms have been enacted to reduce benefit accruals for new hires and to improve the funding of the plan but projections are not enough to ensure the plan will remain viable throughout the next 30 years.

Terry Howerter stated that RTD has an obligation to fund the pension plan at the negotiated rates each year.  He said that when RTD recognizes a substantial liability for the unfunded portion of this plan RTD will wind up with a deficit balance in our fund balance.  Terry Howerter thinks this is an accounting entry to recognize and comply with the GASB and auditor requirements while the legal requirement is what RTD negotiated in the collective bargaining agreement (CBA).

Director Hoy noted that while return on investments (ROI) of over 20% and 14% are impressive, it appears that there are different investment strategies.  Marla Lien explained that in each plan there are trustees.  The RTD Board of Directors appoints the trustees for the Salaried Pension Plan.  She said the Salaried Pension Trust hires investment advisors and firms to invest the funds, and ultimately makes the investment decisions.  Marla Lien stated that the RTD/ATU Pension Trust has different trustees: three RTD salaried members and three from the union.  The RTD/ATU Pension Trust hires its own, separate advisors and firms to invest funds.  She said that this Trust has made different choices over the years.

Director Folska asked for further information about Amendment 22 that was referenced in the presentation.  Marla Lien explained that Amendment 22 was adopted by the RTD/ATU Pension Trust that made changes for participants hired on or after January 1, 2011.

Director Folska expressed concern having this unfunded liability on RTD’s balance sheets.  She wondered what impact this might have on RTD receiving future funding.  Terry Howerter stated that he does not believe this will have a negative impact on RTD’s ability to get funding going forward.

Director Lubow stated that this is not a pretty picture even if RTD is not legally responsible.  She thinks this unfunded liability does not look very good for RTD.  Director Lubow expressed concern that this will create the appearance of fiscal irresponsibility on the part of RTD despite the fact that RTD is not legally responsible.  Terry Howerter believes the appearance of this is big.  He said that through negotiations staff came up with a short term fix for this plan and now staff and the union have to take a close look at this to come up with a long term plan.  Terry Howerter explained that part of the reason the Salaried Employees Pension Plan looks so good is because the trustees had the foresight to put in place a Defined Contribution plan for any employees starting after January 1, 2008; this limits the liability on the Defined Benefits plan.

Director Lubow wonders what other entities are doing if they are coming up with similar funding shortages.  Marla Lien noted that this is being seen in California and Detroit; however, this is an area of law that is just starting to develop.

Director Lubow asked if the Union employees are aware of the funding situation.  She also wonders if information is shared between the two trusts.  Terry Howerter stated that while a 14% ROI in a year is very good the Union side does a different mix of investments.  For example, they are not as invested in real estate as the Salaried Side.   He said that staff would pull together the actuary reports to provide a year-over-year comparison.

Director Bagley commented that last year was an incredible year in the market.  He believes both plans would be lucky to get a 7% ROI this year.  Director Bagley stressed that last year’s returns cannot be expected all the time.

Chair Sisk thanked Leslie Thompson for her presentation.  He believes it was very sobering.  He said that one solution might be to allow people to retire early.  He wonders if this is something available to employees.  Chair Sisk asked that this be something staff considers.

Director Menten reminded the Board that she voted no for the Collective Bargaining Agreement because she thought it was clear that there were some red flags in the pension.  She asked Director Daly, as a former member of ATU, what the Board can do to help the Union employees understand their position.  Director Daly does not think there is a lot the Board can do as this is part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  He said that the members are aware of the situation but are not quite ready for a defined contribution plan.

Committee Chair Walker asked if staff anticipated any policy changes or future employment trends with the new Federal Reserve Chair that might affect RTD.  He also wondered if it would affect RTD’s ability to bond.   Terry Howerter stated that on the Federal Transit Administration side they look at RTD’s cash flows in and out, net revenue coverage, ability to fund, operate and maintain projects, etc.  He said that to them a balance sheet accrual would not have an impact on what they focus on.  Terry Howerter does not anticipate this affecting our ability to bond at all.

#### 3. November 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report (Howerter/MacLeod)

Terry Howerter noted that everything in green in the dashboard.   Doug MacLeod reviewed the November Monthly Financial Status report with the Board that is available in the January 14, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Folska asked if staff has any concerns over a security breach with our Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs) now that we are accepting credit and debit cards.  She also wondered what the cost is to RTD for accepting credit and debit cards.  Terry Howerter stated that RTD does not keep any credit or debit card information locally.  All information goes directly to Wells Fargo and the Clearing House.  He said that the fees RTD charged vary based on a number of factors so he would put together the information and send it to the Board.

Director Folska also asked if her understanding that the subsidy for paying for parking was higher than it is for subsidizing the EcoPass.  Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said he believes Director Folska is referencing a tax free employer transportation benefit program.  He said that at certain times the tax free benefit for parking is higher than for a transit pass.  He stated that he would need to confirm but he believes with the October 1st reauthorization the benefit for parking was increased.

Director Hoy asked for a reminder where the $5.6 million in the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) came from.  Doug MacLeod said this came from a portion of the Civic Center Air Rights sale; $2.5 million was set aside for the Northwest Area Mobility Study and the remainder put in the FISA.

Director Tobiassen shared with the Board that he assisted people getting on the light rail at Nine Mile on Sunday for the Broncos Game.  He commended staff for the new TVM displays.  Director Tobiassen through they were much easier to use, see, etc.  He thanked staff for the upgrades and hard work.

Bruce Abel shared with the Board that for last Sunday’s Bronco’s game in excess of 20k attendees used our service out of a 70k capacity stadium.

Director Menten asked if there had been any issues with RTD customers not being able to use the lot next to the stadium that RTD is leasing from them.  Bruce Abel stated that he was not aware of any but would confirm.
