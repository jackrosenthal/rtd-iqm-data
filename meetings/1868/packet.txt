REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION No. _____ SERIES OF 2014
APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEES TO THE RTD PENSION TRUST AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

Whereas, RTD maintains the RTD Pension Plan and Trust for salaried employees hired by RTD
before January 1, 2008 and the RTD Defined Contribution Plan and Trust (the Trusts) for employees hired on
or after January 1, 2008; and,
Whereas, RTD Board Directors and salaried staff serve as trustees for the Trusts; and,
Whereas on December 16, 2008 the RTD Board of Directory by Resolution No. 19 Series of 2008
amended Section 7.01 of the RTD Pension Trust regarding appointment of Trustees and provided that each
Trustee who is a member of the Board of Directors of RTD shall serve a term concurrent with his or her elected
term, and one senior management and one middle management Trustee shall each serve a three year, and one
senior management and one middle Trustee shall each serve a two year term; and
Whereas on January 8, 2008 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2008
providing that a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension
Trust Fund and the Finance Chair will screen applications from the middle management salaried Employee
Class and the senior management salaried employee calls and will bring recommendations back to the Board;
and,
Whereas on November 10, 2010 Resolution No 27 series of 2010, the Board made additional
modifications to state that for reappointment of trustees who have served satisfactorily and in whose education
the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications for renewal and the
application process established by the RTD Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when
the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts; and,
Whereas the Board of Directors may establish shorter terms as may be necessary to maintain staggered
terms; and,
Whereas, the terms for Scott Reed and Lou Ha expired on 12/31/2013 each of whom has been
previously recommended by the screening committee; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT
1.
The RTD Board of Directors wish to re-appoint Scott Reed to serve as a senior management Trustee on
the Boards of the Trusts with a new two-year term that will expire on 12-31-2015.

2.
The RTD Board of Directors wishes to re-appoint Lou Ha to serve as a middle management Trustee on
the Boards of the Trusts with a new two year term that will expire on 12-31-2015.

Long-Term Funding


Effective with the 2013 Fiscal Year, the funding policy was changed from a
percent of payroll (9% cap) to the recommended contribution amount up to
a $3.1M annual cap




Current funding policy is more prudent given the Plan’s decreasing active
population and resulting reduction in future expected payroll

If all actuarial assumptions are met each year, including a net investment
return of 7.50% per year, and annual contributions equal the recommended
contribution up to a $3.1M annual cap:






The recommended contribution is projected to decrease from $4.4M in the 2014
Fiscal Year
The recommended contribution is expected to exceed the $3.1M cap through the
2019 Fiscal Year and fall below the cap thereafter
The Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2031

Packet Pg. 9

Long-Term Funding (Continued)


Per the investment consultant, the estimated 2013 return on investments
through December 31st is 20.7% (net of fees)




If the net return in 2013 is 20%, the Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in
2018 (13 years earlier), and RTD can expect to pay the $3.1M contribution cap
through the 2016 Fiscal Year (3 fewer years), if all other actuarial assumptions
are met

Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a
significant impact on projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised
of the impact of the Plan’s investment performance on future costs

GASB 67/68


GASB 67 (financial accounting for the Plan) is effective for the Plan’s Fiscal
Year ending December 31, 2014



We will roll forward the January 1, 2014 valuation results to December 31, 2014
Under GASB standards, the long-term investment return assumption must be
sufficient to pay projected benefits and the Plan’s assets must be invested using a
strategy to achieve this investment return




Based on the Plan’s projections and new funding policy, the Plan’s assumed net
investment return of 7.5% satisfies the new GASB standards

GASB 68 (financial accounting for the Employer) is effective for RTD’s Fiscal
Year ending December 31, 2015




RTD may early adopt GASB 68 if desired – to show consistent reporting for the
Plan and Employer
We will provide the applicable disclosure information for 2014 (GASB 27 or GASB
68) along with the GASB 67 information for the Plan in February 2015

January 1, 2013 Valuation Highlights
Ã The normal cost is 13.15% of pay
• The scheduled contribution is 11% of pay
• New agreement does increase contributions over time

Ã Actuarially recommended contribution increased by $1.8M
• This ARC keeps increasing as payments are “missed”

Ã 47.5% funded on an actuarial basis
Ã Total active participant count decreased by 42
• From 1,720 to 1,678
• New hires will “bend down” the normal cost, so more funding can go to the unfunded

accrued liability
