GM Oversight &
Performance Management Committee
VINCE BUZEK: Call the Thursday-- sorry. Yeah, I'd like to call the Thursday, December 2, 2021, GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee to order. We're convened as of 3:04 PM Mountain
Daylight Time. I will not take the roll. Vice Chair Sloan?
MARJORIE SLOAN: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Bouquet?
JULIEN BOUQUET: Present.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Lewis.
SPEAKER 5: Present.
VINCE BUZEK: Chair Rivera-Malpiede?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: : Present.
VINCE BUZEK: And me. So we have a quorum. I'd also like to note we've got some other directors in
attendance. Director Cook, I thought I-- oh, there's Director Tisdale. Any other directors that I have
noticed present at the meeting? I don't see any.
So the first thing up on our agenda is the Executive session moment. We're going to be meeting in
Executive session to discuss personnel matters related to General Manager and CEO Debra Johnson's
2021 performance appraisal. But please note that the board will reconvene in open session after the
Executive session ends. So you should have gotten just recently, another re-send of the link for the
Executive session.

I will now entertain a motion to move into Executive session, pursuant to 24-6-402(4)(f)(I) CRS, for
personnel matters related to General Manager and CEO Debra Johnson's 2021 performance appraisal.
Do I have a motion?
MARJORIE SLOAN: So moved.
PEGGY CATLIN: So moved.
VINCE BUZEK: I have Director Sloan. And who was the second? I have Sloan as the mover. Who was
the second?
MARJORIE SLOAN: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Catlin-- sorry. Thanks. Anybody opposed to moving into Executive session at
this time? Nay. So I guess I will ask-- well, I guess we leave this meeting and then join the other? Yes.
OK. So everybody, leave, and we'll see you all in Executive session. So Directors and CEO Johnson only,
please.

VINCE BUZEK: OK, is everybody back that needs to be here? I see all the GMOC. I see Director Tisdale,
Director Guissinger. Director Cook, I don't see her. She was in the Exec session. Let's give Director Cook
another minute to see if she's going to come on board.
Well, knowing that time is an issue, why don't we get started. I see all the members of the GMOC are
present, along with Directors Guissinger and Tisdale. GM/CEO Johnson is here, as is our staff.
OK, we've got one action item coming out of the-- for the GMOC to consider. So we reconvened at-- I'm
sorry, 3:31 PM. The action item has to do with the acceptance of the appraisal. But I want to make a
comment before we read the motion for the recommended action.
There's been some discussion about some items on page 7 of the packet, the third page of the
evaluation, that will be-- to be determined. My understanding is that GMOC is satisfied that those three
areas for evaluation were contained in other areas that the Board evaluated the GM and CEO on. And so
those sections that are marked TBD in the evaluation will be eliminated from the evaluation, because they
are, in fact, a part of the other categories in the evaluation.
That being said, I need a motion for the Board of Directors to approve General Manager and CEO Debra
A. Johnson's attached performance appraisal for the period of November 9, 2020 through November 8,
2021 and in connection therewith, to approve a 6% total increase-- 3% job description evaluation criteria,
3% job description per personal attributes in the GM/CEO's annual base salary, commencing January 1,
2022. Do I have a motion?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: : So moved, Rivera-Malpiede.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
VINCE BUZEK: OK, I've got Rivera-Malpiede as the mover, and Bouquet as the second. OK, any
discussion on this motion? And once again, just for clarity, when people see the evaluation and the
section that said some areas are to be determined, the GMOC has decided that those will be removed
from the appraisal, because they are part of other areas of the evaluation.
So I've got a motion, a second. I see no discussion. Let's take the roll call vote. Vice Chair Sloan?
MARJORIE SLOAN: Yes

VINCE BUZEK: Director Bouquet?
JULIEN BOUQUET: : Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Dishell?
BOBBY DISHELL: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Lewis?
SPEAKER 5: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Chair Rivera-Malpiede?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: And I'm a Yes as well. OK, so for the record again, that motion contains the resolution of
those three areas that were to be determined. I want to say a couple of things before we go to other
matters, that I want to thank everybody on this GMOC for your hard work. We have undertaken, I think
successfully, a complete transformation in the process by which we evaluate the General Manager and
CEO.
In the past, it was a completely different process. I think the process that we have undertaken, including
the process through this year, but moving forward into the coming years, is a much better mechanism.
And I hope it proves out to be that way.
But I want to thank you all for being here. You all participated. You've all stepped up. Director Bouquet,
you especially, when Director Cook couldn't continue in the role. Thanks so much for that. Thanks for
everybody's comments.
This is our last GMOC meeting for the year. Next year, it's going to be a little bit different with the new
committee structure. So I hope a number of you will be on whatever that committee is, because you did a
great job here. That being said, are there any other matters to come before the GMOC?
OK, seeing none, I need a motion to adjourn?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: : So moved, Rivera-Malpiede.
VINCE BUZEK: OK, second?
PEGGY CATLIN: Second.

VINCE BUZEK: Who was that?
PEGGY CATLIN: Catlin.
VINCE BUZEK: Catlin. OK. Anybody opposed to adjourning? OK, we're adjourned. Thank you, all. Thank
you, GM/CEO Johnson. Thank you, staff, for all your hard work as well. See you all.
PEGGY CATLIN: Bye.
