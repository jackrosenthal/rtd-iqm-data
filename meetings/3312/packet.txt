BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Monthly Government Relations Report – March 2022

Committee Meeting Date:
March 17, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2022 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, RTD must be proactive in educating and informing the District’s elected
officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable Government Relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since
the last Communications and Government Relations Committee meeting held on February 17, 2022. This
report was prepared on March 14, 2022 and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive
Committee meeting scheduled for Thursday, March 17, 2022.
Federal
Congress has passed and the President has signed an omnibus spending package that funds the federal
government through the remainder of federal Fiscal Year 2022 ending September 30, 2022. Most
importantly, this appropriations bill includes funding to match the increases authorized in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law. On February 3, 2022, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) released partial-year
apportionments for transit formula programs that matched funding levels authorized in the previous
Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill (FAST Act). With the passage of the recent omnibus

Packet Pg. 4

1.4.1

spending package, the FTA is anticipated to publish another apportionment notice to reflect the funding
increase from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Also included in the omnibus spending package is specific language and funding to facilitate the return
of RTD’s Credit Risk Premium associated with the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing
loan used for Denver Union Station. The amount included in the bill is $10 million. This funding will
allow the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) to facilitate the return of roughly $29 million in
Credit Risk Premium. Further, Section 109 of the omnibus spending package requires action by USDOT
to facilitate the return of the Credit Risk Premium no later than 60 days after the signing of the bill. The
realization of the return of this funding has been a long-time priority of the Board of Directors and of the
Leadership Team that would not have happened without the strong support of Colorado’s Congressional
Delegation.
State
At the state level, staff, in coordination with the agency’s state lobbyist, is closely tracking the
proceedings of the Colorado General Assembly. In February 2022, the Board adopted a recommended
action in support of HB22-1026, Concerning the replacement of the income tax deduction for amounts
spent by an employer to provide alternative transportation options to employees with an income tax
credit for amounts spent by an employer for that purpose. The bill is currently awaiting action in the
House Appropriations Committee. Additionally, staff is also closely tracking and providing input on
potential legislation that would direct state funding to support “ozone season transit fares” that were
outlined in Governor Polis’ 2022 state budget recommendation. In August 2021, the General Manager
and CEO (GM/CEO) committed to explore “Spare the Air Days” in response to the Accountability
Committee’s recommendations to RTD. Staff and lobbyists are working to secure funding from the state
to assist RTD to implement a successful program that aims to attract and retain transit customers. Staff
will keep the Board apprised of any legislation that is introduced on this matter.
Local
Staff, in coordination with the agency’s local government relations contractor, continues to track and
participate in various meetings of local elected officials. RTD recently participated with the Northwest
Mayors and Commissioners Coalition during their annual meetings with federal elected and
administration officials. Related to the potential state funding for “ozone season transit fares” noted
herein, the Metro Mayors Caucus submitted a letter to the GM/CEO and Board Chair urging support for a
month-long zero-fare program to support improving air quality. In April 2022, the GM/CEO will be
addressing the Metro Mayors Caucus during the group’s full caucus meeting and will discuss, among
other items, a potential fare-free transit program.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Delegation of Authority and Competitive Selection

Committee Meeting Date:
March 8, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
March 22, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. _____, Series of 2022, regarding delegation of
authority and competitive selection, which updates the delegations of purchasing and contracting,
budget-transfer, and settlement authority consistent with the Board’s Bylaws, the RTD Act, and
regulations published by the Federal Transit Administration.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In accordance with its Bylaws and the RTD Act, the Board of Directors previously delegated certain
purchasing and contracting authority to the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) in Resolution No. 7,
Series of 1990, adopted August 14, 1990, and Resolution No. 19, Series of 2007, adopted November
20, 2007.
The Board additionally delegated budget-transfer authority to the GM/CEO in a Budget Transfer Policy,
adopted February 26, 1985, and Resolution No. 19, Series of 2007, adopted November 20, 2007.
DISCUSSION
In adopting Resolution ____, Series of 2022, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the
strategic priority of Financial Success.
The resolution defines the term “contract” as including any legally binding agreement or purchase orders
between RTD and one or more parties, including contracts for goods or services, intergovernmental
agreements, grants, real property agreements, and revenue agreements.
Consistent with established policies and procedures, the resolution grants the GM/CEO authority and
responsibility to approve, within the adopted budget for a given fiscal year:
• All purchase requisitions
• Routine procurements for operational needs as enumerated in the resolution
• Contracts up to $2 million resulting from solicitations specified in the resolution
• Contract amendments and change orders in an amount up to 25% of the contract amount
Pursuant to the resolution, the Board is responsible for authorization of any contract over $2 million,
other than routine procurements for operational needs. Upon authorization, the Board delegates to the
GM/CEO authority and responsibility for contract execution, amendments, and change orders.
Additionally, the resolution increases:

Packet Pg. 7

2.15.A

•
•

The threshold for purchase requisitions requiring a competitive solicitation to $250,000
The GM/CEO’s budget transfer authority to $1 million

The resolution also incorporates by reference a delegation of authority to the General Counsel, initially
granted pursuant to a recommended action adopted on April 21, 2015, to settle claims made against the
agency in amounts up to the limits established in the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act, Article 10
of Title 24, Colorado Revised Statutes. For claims accruing on or after January 1, 2022 through
December 31, 2026 the limitations are:
• $424,000 for any injury to one person in a single occurrence
• $1,195,000 for any injury to two or more persons in any single occurrence, with no person
receiving more than $424,000
Further the resolution authorizes the GM/CEO to redelegate any authority granted pursuant to the
resolution, though the GM/CEO retains overall responsibility for matters conducted under such authority.
The GM/CEO shall provide a monthly report to the Board of the contracts executed during the previous
month pursuant to the resolution.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
May 2022 Service Plan

Committee Meeting Date:
March 9, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
March 22, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the May 2022 Service Change package as revised and summarized
in Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001, the May 2022
Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for bus and rail operators to select new work
assignments and the opportunity for Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations
plan for the transit network. Current system-wide ridership trends are relatively stable, showing an
overall increase in ridership with a customary drop in ridership associated with the holiday season (see
Figure 1 in Attachment B). However, operator availability challenges still exist, made worse by absentee
issues relating to COVID-19, making it more difficult to both maintain system on-time performance and
expand service offerings to customers.
DISCUSSION
Following the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence and recognizing
the agency’s “people power” problem, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time
performance, adhering to the CBA and adjusting service levels to match anticipated summer ridership
demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on established Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations

2.15.B

Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID-induced economic slowdown, the overarching
guidance for the proposed May 2022 service changes come from the Board adopted guidance for
COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.” A summary of the list of service proposals are provided below, which are
detailed in Attachment A.
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Three public meetings were conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams on the following dates and times:
• Tuesday February 3, 2022 at 5 p.m.
• Monday February 7, 2022 at 5 p.m.
• Tuesday February 8, 2022 at noon
The meetings have been recorded and are available for review. Comments from this public input period
have been summarized and listed in Attachments C and D of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of
the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose modifications to

Route reductions and suspensions have had a significant impact on mobility. The metropolitan Denver
area is expanding rapidly, and as a result, more reliable transportation options are desired. However,
obtaining and maintaining the necessary resources, which include labor, facilities and vehicles; has
been a challenge during the pandemic. As witnessed from the gathered input from the public comment
process, customers expect RTD to live up to its reputation for providing convenient and dependable
service.

KEY FEEDBACK
Customers have expressed their dissatisfaction with canceled, halted, or limited services. The
widespread view is that RTD service must return to full service. Customers have stated that traveling
with RTD is a less optimum option than using alternative modes of transportation because of
irregularity in services. The following are the items that garnered the most feedback:
•

Support for the Route 228 Reconfiguration

•

FF branches: reinstate all FF branches

•

Reinstate the GS

•

Route 10: reinstate east of 9th and Clermont and adjust running
time

•

Route 20: change WB early morning trip to earlier departure

•

Route 76: return to regular service

•

Route 169L: increase frequency

•

Reinstate C and F lines
