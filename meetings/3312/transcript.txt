Executive Committee Meeting
VINCE BUZEK: [CLEARS THROAT] Thanks. Executive Committee will now come to order. We are
convened as of 12:01 PM. I would respectfully ask everyone attending this meeting to unmute yourself
unless you're recognized to speak. And I'll call the roll. First Vice Chair Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: Second Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: Secretary Sloan. Treasurer Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: And Chair Buzek is here. Other Directors in attendance are Director Tisdale, Director
Williams, Director Cook. Did I miss any other Directors? [CLEARS THROAT] I don't think so. Staff in
attendance is-- we have GM CEO Johnson. We've got our General Counsel Melanie Snyder. We've got
Jillian Knapp-Rhodes, Randy Hunter, Michael Davies, John McKay, Tai-Shrae Parish. Did I miss any
staff? I don't think so. And, of course-- oh, Robert McManus up there in the corner of my screen. And, of
course, Jenifer Brandeberry is joining us live from wherever you are. Thanks for being here.
[CLEARS THROAT] I'd like to open the public comment period to anyone who would like to address the
committee. If you wish to speak and have not already done so, please either raise your virtual hand or
press star 9 on your phone. Staff will unmute you when it's your turn to speak. If you are dialed in, press
star 6 to toggle your mute settings.
Please bear in mind that by participating in this process, you are being recorded. If you do not wish to be
recorded, then your comments will have to be submitted in writing, and you will not have the opportunity
to speak this afternoon. If any speaker has documentation or reference materials for the committee, or if
any member of the public would like to submit written comments, please email those materials to the
Board office to the following email address-- rtd.boardoffice@rtd-denver.com.
Speakers should begin their remarks by stating their names. And each speaker will have three minutes to
speak. Our first speaker is-- Miss McManus, do we have any speakers?
BARBARA MCMANUS: We have one attendee. And they're not looking like they'd like to speak.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. Sounds good.
DOUG TISDALE: Mr. Chairman?

VINCE BUZEK: Yes, Mr. Tisdale, Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, sir. I just wanted to point out that Directors Rivera-Malpiede,
Broom, and Catlin are actually in the other meeting right now, the Executive session per email received
from General Counsel Snyder. And I forwarded to Director Rivera-Malpiede the link for this meeting. But
perhaps staff might wish to contact them and assist them in migrating from the Executive session into the
open session for the time being.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for that. I know we have Director Catlin here. She's on both simultaneously. But if
there's any way we could reach out to the other Directors that are in the teams meeting and tell them
we're gathered here, that would be great.
OK. With no participants in queue for public comment, I will close the public comment period. Do we have
any other-- no, we're good. Next is the March Board meeting agenda review. Is there a motion to move
the March Board agenda to the Board meeting on March 22? I need a motion.
TROY WHITMORE: So move.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Second.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Whitmore and Director Guissinger. Any discussion about the agenda for the
March 22 meeting? Miss McManus?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah. I just want to note that we'll be sending out that agenda for the Board
meeting next Tuesday, tomorrow after the press conference so that we can include the meeting minutes
for this meeting as well as the special Board meeting tomorrow in that packet.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks. Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: This isn't especially about the agenda for this. But as we get used to how we deal
with our smaller committees, I was thinking that we had a nice presentation on the fare inequity study in
the Finance Committee meeting last week. And that may make more sense to do in Board meetings
where everybody's present, big presentations like that. Or maybe I should say presentations on important
issues like that.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. Does anybody else have any comments in that vein? GM COE Johnson?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. And thank you very much, First Chair Director
Guissinger. Just for clarification, in reference to the recommendation for Director Guissinger, would that
be in addition to or in lieu of?
LYNN GUISSINGER: In lieu of so everybody can see. It may not apply that often, but that's certainly an
important piece we're moving forward with. We wouldn't do it twice.

DEBRA JOHNSON: Thank you for the clarification. And I guess we have to work in collaboration with the
chair and perhaps others to discern what would qualify as the circumstance in which that would be
brought forward as opposed to a committee. So thank you.
LYNN GUISSINGER: You bet.
VINCE BUZEK: Great, thanks. Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah. I just wanted to voice agreement with that. I think for some topics where the
interest would span the committees and a chance to present it to all at once before the Board when we're
not taking action-- I think that's a really good thought. So just adding that point there.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks. General Counsel Snyder.
MELANIE SNYDER: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just for the sake of the record, we've got a motion and the
second outstanding on the agenda approval. I know we were talking a little bit outside of that motion.
[INAUDIBLE] discussion on the motion and then call for a vote.
VINCE BUZEK: Right. Let's discuss the motion call for a vote. And if we want to have some more
discussion, let's bring this up in other matters. So we've got a first and a second. Are there any no votes
for approving the agenda for the March 22 meeting? Seeing none, that passes. That moves forward.
[CLEARS THROAT] When we come back to other matters, let's talk about the issue of bringing things
before the Board instead of committees. So I'd like to have a little bit of discussion about that. So next is
our Executive session. In a moment, the Directors will meet in Executive session to receive legal advice in
relation to the process under the Board bylaws for the Executive Manager to the Board's performance
appraisal, performance planning, and related compensation considerations. Please note that-MELANIE SNYDER: Pardon me, Chair. Chair, pardon me. I'm sorry to interrupt. Melanie Snyder, General
Counsel. So we do have a couple of discussion items on the agenda before we.
VINCE BUZEK: No, I'm sorry. [LAUGHS] You're right. Nevermind. I'm sorry. I skipped that entire section.
Trying to speed things along. I'm sorry. We do have the government relations report. General Manager
Johnson, would you or Michael Davies like to present this item?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. And I would like to acknowledge Michael Davies,
who is on this call. He is prepared to provide a report as it relates to local, state, and federal government
relations activities since you last convened in the month of February. So with that, I'll yield the floor to Mr.
Davies.
MICHAEL DAVIES: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. Michael Davies, Government
Relations officer. Just a brief report for you. I'll start with federal and start with good news with the signing
of the omnibus bill that happened in Congress late last week and then over the weekend with the
president. One big item that has been a long time priority of the agency. And that is the credit risk
premium associated with our RIFF loan, our Railroad Rehabilitation and Financing Act loan.

So the CRP was authorized to be returned. And language was changed within the IIJA, which is
otherwise known as the bipartisan infrastructure law. That was signed into law previously. To facilitate
that language, there was needed to be an appropriation attached to that. And that actually now allows
USDOT the ability to return that credit risk premium.
So as I said, that's a long term goal that our federal lobbyists and then really to the credit of our federal
delegation, our congressional members have been tenacious at trying to get this done over the years.
And so with the signing of the omnibus bill, there was language specifically in there to facilitate that return
of the credit risk premium. So that's just great news. And again, a big thank you to our congressional
delegation for their work on that matter. It would not have happened without their support.
More good news associated on the federal front with the signing of the omnibus appropriations bill. And
this is for the remainder of federal fiscal year 2022, which runs from October 1, 2021, until September 30,
2022. And that's the federal fiscal year.
With the signing of the omnibus bill, that unlocks the authorized increases that were associated with the
IIJA or bipartisan infrastructure law. Those increases we'll see directly through formula programs that are
administered by FTA. And what this does by signing the omnibus bill is that it allows FTA to move forward
with issuing a new apportionment notice. And I believe FTA has said sometime around the first week of
April is when they're expecting to issue a new apportionment notice. And that largely then allows transit
agencies throughout the United States to go ahead and start applying and drawing down funding
associated with those increases.
So recall that a major policy point of the IIJA was to help transit agencies tackle their state of good repair
backlog. There's about 105 billion throughout the entire nation of state of good repair backlog and transit.
These increases will greatly assist in that effort. And so that's more good news associated with the
signing of this federal omnibus appropriations bill. It really sets the stage also going forward in future
years of appropriations that Congress is adhering to the authorized levels in the IIJA. And so we continue
to track that closely. But good news there.
Lastly, just on the federal front. And this is just a bit of information that I've seen happen. The US Senate
voted yesterday to approve a Senate resolution by a vote of 57 to 40. And that was on disapproving of the
CDC's extension of the mask mandate to April 18. And the president then issued a veto threat for that and
said that the CDC is addressing this and is going to reevaluate the policy.
But it is just a discussion in Congress that I wanted to make you all aware of. I don't know if there's any
plans that the house would bring this up, but it did pass the Senate yesterday. And our senators had a
split vote on that. Senator Bennett voted to disapprove of the resolution, and Senator Hickenlooper voted
no on that.
At the state level, not a long report there. And I know Jenifer is on the line as well and can chime in and
answer any questions. But with regards to a Board approved bill on House Bill 1026-- and that's the
alternative transportation options tax credit-- that bill still is sitting in the Appropriations Committee. And I
think a lot of bills are sitting in the Appropriations Committee. There's a little bit of a backup. And it's

taking the state General Assembly some time to work through all those bills. So no real movement on that
bill.
And then with regards to the efforts on fare free transit, there's no bill introduced on that yet. So I don't
have a lot of new news on that or any clear direction on what that will look like. But obviously, RTD is very
engaged in that issue and working with the administration and members of the General Assembly to try to
offer best practices for how we can best participate in this effort and be a part of the overall efforts coming
out of the state on air quality. And I'll stop right there and see if Jenifer has anything else to add on the
state side.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks. Miss Brandeberry? Nothing? You're good? OK. Thanks, Michael. Does that
conclude your report?
MICHAEL DAVIES: Just real quickly on the local front, just wanted to highlight a couple of places where
RTD staff continues to have robust partnership and participation with many of our local elected official
groups. I just highlight the Northwest Mayors and Commissioners Coalition. They do an annual series of
meetings in Washington, DC, with the federal delegation advocating for projects and priorities that are out
of the Northwest Area Mobility study, the NAM study, specifically State Route Highway 119 up there that
is a big priority.
And that was a primary topic of their support in a round of meetings in RTD staff, including the General
Manager, participated with the group in their meetings there and offered support. And I think that will
conclude my report. And happy to answer any questions.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Mr. Davies, for that report. Director Tisdale, you've got your hand up.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to follow up relative to the signing of
the omnibus bill, which was signed by the president at 4:02 PM Eastern Daylight Time on Tuesday,
March 15, 2022. And the bill not only facilitates the return of our credit risk premium, it mandates the
return of our credit risk premium. And it mandates such return within 60 days of the date that the
president signed it.
Given the fact that May 14 is the 60th day, which is a Saturday, that means that no later than Monday,
May 16, we are to have the return of the credit risk premium together with interest thereon. I had dinner
with Patty Doersch, our federal lobbyist with Squire, Patton, Boggs, on Tuesday night in Washington. And
we all celebrated that.
And we did give a special thank you to the members of Congress who were at the Congressional
reception, thanking them for their participation in getting that done for us. And we will be communicating
to each of our congressional delegation members along with other principal staffers who really work very
hard with our team to get that done. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Director Tisdale. And that's great news. I know this battle has been fought for
[LAUGHS] long before I've been on the RTD Board. And it's good to have some final results. First Vice
Chair Guissinger, go ahead.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you. Yes, that's great news. I'm thrilled about getting the CRP back. Michael,
do we know how much we should get for the state of good repair, the increase on the formula funding? Or
is that a grant process?
MICHAEL DAVIES: It is a formula grant process. I don't have the clear numbers off of my head. There is
the greater urbanized area formula, and then there is a separate state of good repair formula. Both of
those are formula programs that received increases. Generally, I can say the formula programs received
about a 30% increase above what our current levels of funding are through the formula programs.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Great. Thanks.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for that question. Any other Directors with questions for Mr. Davies? Great.
Michael, thanks again for that report. Moving on, we have a retreat update from First Vice Chair
Guissinger. And I have my interview with our facilitator at 2 o'clock this afternoon. So cool. Go ahead.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Great. Thanks so much. I just had my interview with our facilitator. I think we're very
lucky. I think we had one applicant. And he's very experienced. He's worked with a number of local
governments. He's done work that RTD has been involved with in the past. He's done a lot of work with
CDOT and others in terms of transportation and is very well respected as Jonathan Bartsch from CDR
Associates.
I think everybody should have received-- he mentioned that he sent everybody an email pretty much at
the same time individually to set a time to talk to him and look at the four areas. If you go back to the
scope of work that was sent out, it has the four topics that we generally gleaned from feedback when we
sent out to the Board members to give their topics they would like to discuss. And those were pulled
together.
But I think his hope is to expand on those or see if there are other topics that need to be discussed. And
it's coming up. It's right around the corner, probably something like 8 to 3 on the 26th. And I don't know if
Miss McManus has anything to add in terms of logistics, where it will be, that sort of thing.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. It's going to be at the Performing Arts Center again, but a different section of
it. We're in one of the salons right at the [INAUDIBLE] House as you're walking straight in from the street
on the left-hand side. We'll get directions out to everybody when we're closer to the date.
That area, we have everything set up with the IT and AV companies. It'll be set up a little bit differently
because of how the space is laid out. Each attendee will be at their own bistro table. As far as we know,
everything is set. We have all the contracts signed. And we're ready to go.

LYNN GUISSINGER: Somebody had suggested a while back that maybe we all could go out for a glass
of wine or a beer or something afterwards. And is that something people think makes sense? Social, of
course. I see a thumbs up from Mr. Tisdale.
VINCE BUZEK: He'll be starting before the retreat.
LYNN GUISSINGER: [LAUGHS] And a thumbs up from Troy. Others think that's a good idea? If anybody
has suggestions-- maybe, Barbara, you have some thoughts of where that could take place. And then we
can talk.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah there's a couple of places right in that immediate area. And I'll talk with you
offline. And we'll set something up and see if we can't get a separate portion of that space to meet in so
that when a group like that shows up, we're not hitting them from behind.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Good. Yeah, even outside depending on-- if we're hitting spring weather then, that
would be great. But I'll talk to you. Thanks.
BARBARA MCMANUS: All right.
LYNN GUISSINGER: [INAUDIBLE]
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for the report. And it should be interesting. So it's going to be a little bit different
than past repeats, right? Because not so much goal setting. We've done that through our Performance
Committee. And will be interesting to see how this all shakes out. So thanks again for that report.
Now is time to move into an Executive session and to discuss process under Board bylaws for the
Executive Manager to the Board's performance appraisal, performance planning, and related
compensation considerations. And again, please note that we will reconvene after the Executive session
back here in the Executive Committee on Zoom.
So we're going to go to teams and back to Zoom. I will now entertain a motion to move into Executive
session pursuant to section 24-6-402(4)(b)CRS to receive legal advice regarding process under Board
bylaws for Executive Manager to the Board's performance appraisal, performance planning, and related
compensation considerations. Is there a motion?
PEGGY CATLIN: So moved.
VINCE BUZEK: OK, Catlin. Is there a second?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think Troy is trying.
TROY WHITMORE: Second.
LYNN GUISSINGER: [LAUGHS]

VINCE BUZEK: From Director Whitmore. Any opposed to moving into the Executive session? Great.
Would all of those entitled to participate in the Executive session at this time please move into the other
meeting now? Thanks.

we clean and-VINCE BUZEK: OK. Melanie's connected. OK. So we've lost Director Whitmore. He had to check. So we
just have me and Second Vice Chair Catlin and First Vice Chair Guissinger. I still think we have a
quorum, correct? Yeah.
OK. So we're moving out of Executive session and moving on-- [COUGHS] pardon me-- to other matters.
A couple of things I want to raise in other matters for the Executive Committee's consideration. And that is
we're talking generally about the Board Office Executive Manager's evaluation process and how that
works. My belief is that it's a little cumbersome.
And I'd like to have us consider as we move forward not today but in future executive sessions revamping
the performance appraisal mechanism, the mechanics of it, so that it works more smoothly and that so
the Board chair, whoever that person might be, isn't the only one that's involved to the greatest degree. I'd
like the Executive Committee to be more involved in those types of decisions.
And I'd also like the Executive Committee to have a discussion in the future about the hiring authority for
the Executive Manager to be placed in the Board of Directors as it is with a General Manager because

the Executive Manager in theory and practice reports to the Board of Directors. I don't like the solid lines
and dashed lines.
And I think that provides not only confusion to the Board members, but I would think the Executive
Manager wonders, who's my boss? So I think that might simplify things as we move forward, put a little
more pressure and work on the Board. But anyway, something that we'll talk about as we move forward.
Miss Snyder, am I missing anything about other matters that I-- oh, process for 2021. Is that right? OK. So
the process for 2021 Executive Committee is that the Chair and the-- I think it's got-- CEO of GM, identify
somebody of senior management level or higher to conduct surveys of the Executive Committee and the
Board for input on the Executive Manager's performance. Did I summarize it fairly accurately, Miss
Snyder?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes, that's correct. So I think it's appropriate for the Executive Committee right now
to talk about who that would be.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah. And I have talked to Debra Johnson. And she concurs. We believe that Leah Riley
should be the senior management level employee. And she will work hand in hand with Ken Enright, who
is our acting HR Manager, to solicit feedback and input from members of the Executive Committee and
from members of the Board for the evaluation. And Miss McManus, I think we're going to have to see
about extending the deadline to the end of April to get everything accomplished in an appropriate fashion.
And I hope that's acceptable.
OK. Is there any other discussion among members of the Executive Committee with regard to these
recommendations moving forward for 2021's evaluation? I guess the only thing I didn't talk about is the
form that we use. And we've used the salary employees form in the past. I don't want to change that
today. [LAUGHS] So I've looked at it, and I've looked at prior valuations. I think it hits all the high marks.
And Miss McManus has done her self-evaluation with that form.
So let's just stick with that. Is everybody OK with doing that as well for 2021? Yes. And, Lynn, shake your
head. Yes, Lynn. [LAUGHS] OK. Lynn says yes. OK. So, Melanie, do you want to weigh in real quick?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes, just a point of clarification. So it sounds like you're saying that you'll use the
2021 appraisal form for salaried employees. And then will you also use the 2022 performance planning
form that salaried employees are using? Or is that for a separate conversation?
VINCE BUZEK: I think that's a separate conversation because we may have other changes as well.
MELANIE SNYDER: OK. Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: [CLEARS THROAT] Second question, Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think we also had a discussion about the role that former Chair
Rivera-Malpiede will provide assistance to you for [INAUDIBLE]

VINCE BUZEK: Yeah. Thanks for that addition. So I will be performing the evaluation for Miss McManus
for 2021. But I will seek input from Director Rivera-Malpiede because she was the Chair at that time. So
yeah, absolutely. Definitely. Director Tisdale and Broom, do you guys have any input with regard to where
we are now and maybe moving forward after this? I'd like to hear from you if possible.
DOUG TISDALE: I have nothing further. And I think-- oh, excuse me. Wait. I lost my video there. I have
nothing further to present. And I think you summarized well the important discussion of process going
forward so we can complete this in a timely manner or as timely as circumstances allow. Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: Great. Thanks for that input. Director Broom, if you're there, you have anything you want
to add?
BOB BROOM: No, but thanks for asking.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Director Broom. And thanks, everybody, for attending. Are there any other
matters to come before the Executive Committee? Seeing no further discussion, the meeting is adjourned
at 1:40 PM. Oh, I'm sorry, Miss McManus. Don't go anywhere. Miss McManus, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
BARBARA MCMANUS: [LAUGHS] Hi. So I just have a couple of things. So we've made an offer to
someone for the open position in the Board Office after going out through the recruiting process three
separate times. We're hoping that they take the offer. And if all goes well, hopefully we'll have someone
seated in about three weeks.
I also wanted to just give a quick update. There are two study sessions that have been added. One is the
study session on April 19 starting at 5:30. And that's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. And the second one
being June 21, which was requested by the Board regarding Reimagine RTD. So they're both on the two
week calendar. But I wanted to just bring that forward as well to this group.
And just a quick update. Now that the redistricting is completed, my office will be starting the election
process with the Secretary of State. We're waiting right now for a complete listing of all of the precincts for
each of the districts based on the changes that were made. And once we get that information, we'll be
putting together the packets and checking out on the Secretary of State site on any prospective
candidates that have signed up already for any of the districts that are up for election. So I'll be continuing
to bring that update as we move along just so everybody knows where we are in the process.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for that information, Miss Snyder.
MELANIE SNYDER: Yeah, and just to add, Barbara, I think that the ad hoc [INAUDIBLE] committee also
set a meeting for I see April 11. And that might be something that other Directors want to attend. Do I
have that wrong, Barbara? I see you're scowling. I thought that was-BARBARA MCMANUS: No. No, no, no. [LAUGHS] I was just writing.
MELANIE SNYDER: Thank you.

VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for that. And I know you will all be thrilled to learn that I filed my candidate
affidavit last week to seek re-election to my position. [LAUGHS] Come on. Applause. Anyway.
And with regard to study sessions, I'm working with the General Manager on a study session regarding
zero emission vehicles implementation and integration. And we're going to put that off a little bit because
she, Debra Johnson, has just been asked to be on a panel-- I believe it's the FTA perhaps that's doing
this panel to begin setting policy on what that looks like, what's a zero emission vehicle, how do you-- and
all that stuff. So that'll be good. She should come back with some great information. So I want to move
that forward and ultimately appoint an ad hoc committee to really study that in depth.
Any other matters to come before the Executive Committee? Seeing none, we are adjourned at 1:43 PM.
Thanks, everybody.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: Bye-bye.
