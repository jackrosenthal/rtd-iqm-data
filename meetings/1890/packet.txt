Board Meeting Date: March 4, 2014

Subject:

Budget Transfer for West Rail Line Track
Paving

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to transfer $650,000 of the remaining funds from the Wadsworth
parking structure project to install track paving at three RTD West Line Light Rail Stations.
BACKGROUND
RTD Light Rail Operations Division was notified by the train operators of pedestrians’ crossing over the
open ballast area to board trains at three stations. All of the light rail stations have an ADA approved
crossing; however, they are in a specified location and are not being used by the general public.
Additionally, representatives from Safety and Security noticed this action shortly after revenue services
started. As this poses a significant safety issue, we are proposing to fill the ballasted area between the
designated ADA crossings with concrete. This would create a solid, safe crossing structure for the
general public to use as needed and diminish the prospect of an individual tripping or falling in or near
the tracks.
The three specific stations are located at the Federal Center, Auraria West and the Sheridan Station.
DISCUSSION
Work will include the track paving at these three stations along with all required coordination with RTD
Light Rail personnel for site access. Work will be conducted during a scheduled Light Rail shut down or
with single tracking during off-peak areas so as not to inconvenience the traveling public and to provide
worker safety during the project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
As part of the West Rail Line (WRL) transit corridor, located between the Auraria Campus in downtown
Denver and the Jefferson County Government Center in Golden, RTD constructed two parking structures
at Wadsworth and Sheridan. Swinerton Builders was awarded a contract for both structures. The
portion of the overall WRL budget for the garages was $37.2M. The project was completed on schedule
and under budget. Funds from this underrun will be used to fund the track paving work. Funding for this
transfer is available in the 2014 Adopted Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to transfer $650,000 of
the remaining funds from the Wadsworth parking structure project to install track paving at three
RTD West Line Light Rail Stations.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to transfer the funds. Instead, leave the three West Corridor Light Rail Stations as they currently are
with the pedestrian’s crossing over the open ballast. This alternative is not recommended as it

Subject:

Property Acquisition for the North Metro
Rail Line Phase 2

F.

Clarke,Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: March 4, 2014

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro Rail
Line Phase 2 from 72nd Avenue to 124th Avenue, Adams County, Colorado and authorize staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General
Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to execute real property
transactions.
BACKGROUND
Right of way necessary for the construction of the project must be acquired. Properties required for
Phase I (south of 72nd Avenue) were approved by the Board in September 2011 and May 2013. Property
needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition process.
This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under
eminent domain law. Staff recommends proceeding with the acquisition of all property identified,
subject to any modifications or additions required by the contractor and/or design/build activities.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or the Project Manager to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the FasTracks budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the North Metro Rail Line Phase 2 and authorizing staff to proceed with
all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General Manager or his
designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to execute real property transactions.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2013
NORTH METRO SEGMENT 1 COMMUTER RAIL PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the North Metro Rail Line Phase II; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list
the property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation
to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the
authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it
deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the
power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the North
Metro Rail Line Phase II, although financially compensated according to the law, makes a
significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by others who benefit
from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that
there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in
furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are for the benefit of the public
health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Manager, as the Board’s
delagatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
The Board directs that the RTD delagatees should negotiate in good faith for the
acquisition of the property and if the delagatee is unable to acquire any property through good
faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power
of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property
owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of
owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties
as soon as permitted by law.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 27, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 27, 2014

Board Meeting Date: March 4, 2014

Subject:

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the West Colfax Business
Improvement District for the Transfer of RTD
Shelters & RTD Site Maintenance

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or designee to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) for the transfer of
ownership of 7 older model “Daytech” shelters & 2 trash receptacles, and to reimburse WC-BID for the
purchase and installation of 5 new trash receptacles. The cost of the trash receptacles is included in the
2014 Adopted Budget for local government requests.
BACKGROUND
The West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) has received a grant from Denver’s Office of
Economic Development. As a part of this grant the WC-BID is proposing to refurbish 7 older “Daytech”
passenger shelters, which currently belong to RTD, into an artistic, one-of-a-kind, functional artwork to
replace the older shelters along a portion of W. Colfax between Irving St. and Sheridan Blvd. The WCBID has commissioned an artist to perform this refurbishment and will provide any and all special
maintenance needs for these shelters and other transit amenities (benches and trash receptacles). RTD’s
Facilities Maintenance currently maintains the existing shelters and provides site custodial services.
DISCUSSION
The WC-BID has requested that RTD transfer ownership of 7 of the older Daytech style shelters with
map cases & wood benches, and 2 existing trash receptacles to them for refurbishment, reinstallation
and future capital maintenance thereof. The WC-BID also has requested reimbursement from RTD for
the purchase and installation of 5 new trash receptacles. Additionally, it is requested that RTD continue
to provide routine custodial maintenance at the proposed 7 locations, which would include sweeping,
trash removal, snow removal and periodic washing similar to that currently performed by RTD.
RTD currently has 5 shelters (of 3 different styles) at 7 of the proposed locations; a 6th shelter was
recently removed for redevelopment at the southeast corner of W. Colfax and Irving. All locations have
sufficient passenger boardings to warrant RTD shelters and site custodial services.
The proposed IGA includes provisions for constructing and maintaining transit improvements at the
following 7 locations along West Colfax; 1) Winona EB, (2) Raleigh WB, (3) Raleigh EB, (4) Meade EB,
(5) Knox Ct. EB, (6) Irving WB, and (7) Irving EB:. Key provisions of the IGA include the following:






Routine and Capital Maintenance Responsibilities
Transfer of shelters, benches, and trash receptacle ownership
Easement/License Agreements and/or ROW determinations and allowances
Resolving structural design issues
Bus Operations, Facility Maintenance, IT, Safety & Security concerns and/or needs

Packet Pg. 45

2.B.1

The proposed IGA includes provisions allowing RTD full and continued use of the transit improvements
by its patrons and maintenance personnel. The IGA also addresses an initial 5-year term with automatic
annual renewal provisions. Termination options are included if the WC-BID does not uphold the terms of
the IGA, which includes capital maintenance of the shelters.
An RTD Management Directive entitled “Special Design Requests for Bus Passenger Shelters” identifies a
Board Policy in regards to local governments requesting passenger shelters that differ from RTD’s
standard design. It states: “RTD agrees to share in the cost of installing another type of shelter in an
amount equal to the average cost of installing an RTD standard shelter, provided, that the local agency
agrees to obtain all necessary permits, licenses and agreements, to retain full ownership of such shelter,
to indemnify RTD from any and all damages that may arise out of public use of such shelter, and to
maintain such passenger shelter in good repair and in a clean and safe condition at all times.”
The Capital Programs Engineering staff believes this proposal is within the limits of this policy, with the
possible exception of the maintenance aspect. RTD will provide routine custodial maintenance of the
bus stops. WC-BID will provide any and all capital maintenance, which includes repairing and/or
replacing damage from ordinary wear and tear, vandalism, destruction, glass replacement and painting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD would reimburse WC-BID for the cost of five new trash receptacles, which is estimated at $5,000.
Funding for this reimbursement is included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for local government requests.
The Daytech shelters to be transferred to the WC-BID are fully depreciated and have no book value.
Therefore, the donation would have no financial impact to RTD.
There would be no net impact to RTD’s shelter maintenance costs because RTD currently provides
custodial services at the seven sites, and would continue to do so under the IGA. In the long run, RTD
would save the cost of replacing the seven Daytech shelters, which is estimated at $87,000. The
timing of these savings is not known because RTD had not programmed replacement of these shelters in
2014.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or designee to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with West Colfax Business
Improvement District (WC-BID) for the transfer of ownership of 7 older model “Daytech” shelters & 2
trash receptacles, and to reimburse WC-BID for the purchase and installation of 5 new trash
receptacles. The cost of the trash receptacles is included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for local
government requests.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This would result in leaving
the local area bus stops in a poor condition that is unacceptable to the WC-BID. This could
potentially mean the loss of its grant funding. This would require that RTD continue its custodial and
capital maintenance of the 5 existing shelters. This could result in RTD needing to upgrade all the
RTD bus stops with new amenities and providing both custodial and capital maintenance at our sole
cost.
3. Delay acceptance of the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This could result in a

possible loss of the currently approved WC-BID grant, which needs to move forward with committed
action by the end of the 2014 2nd Qtr.
