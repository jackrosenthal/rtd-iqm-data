January 1, 2017 Valuation Highlights
(the plan is in funding peril)
• Contributions are not sufficient to fund the liabilities

– The amount of insufficiency has decreased
– Total Actuarially Determined Contribution (ADC) is 23.63% (prior year
was 25.69%); 18.0% scheduled for receipt in 2017
– The contribution deficiency decreased, from 7.69% of payroll to 5.63%

• Fund is projected to be fully depleted by 2040; last year was 2035
and the prior year was 2039
– Assuming 6% earnings the depletion date is 2035

• Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by $11.5 million
– From $436.3 million to $447.8 million

• Actuarial Value of Assets returned 6.35%, short of the assumed
7.0%
– Increased by $2.8 million, from $211.4 million to $214.2 million
– Market value increased from $202.2 million to $203.8 million

1.C.1.a

January 1, 2017 Valuation Highlights
(the plan is in funding peril)

• Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability increased by
$8.7 million
– From $224.8 million to $233.5 million

• The ADC as a dollar amount increased 5% from
the prior year

– There were gains due to anticipated lower benefits
than expected and due to new hires having a lower
normal cost;
– There were losses due to contributions less than the
ADC, the change in the mortality assumption, and
investment earnings less than assumed
– These two sources offset each other

Attachment: Represented Employee DB Pension Plan (3542 : Represented Employee DB Pension Plan)

1.C.1.a

January 1, 2017 Valuation Highlights
• The normal cost decreased from 10.31% of pay (including admin
expenses) to 9.65%
– The scheduled contribution is 18% of pay

• Actuarially determined contribution (ADC) decreased by 2.06% of
pay
– The decrease is due to the population growth from the prior year.
More members are now in the new tier.
– ADC will continue to have upward pressure as the actuarially
determined contributions are “missed”

• Funded ratio decreased from 48.5% funded on an actuarial basis to
47.8%
• Total active participant count grew by 226

– From 1,623 to 1,849 (966 in Tier 2)
– New hires continue to “bend down” the normal cost, so more funding
can go to the unfunded accrued liability

Long-Term Funding-Reforms to improve the
plan
•
•

Total ADC is 23.63% of payroll compared to the total scheduled contribution rate
of 18.00% of payroll.
Amendment #22 was adopted in 2010 with the following changes in effect for
participants hired on or after January 1, 2011 (Tier 2):
– New benefit schedule listed in Section 6.01 of the Plan provisions
m
m
m

m
m

Vesting is changed from 5 years to 10 years
The benefit multiplier is changed from 2.5% to 1.0%
Unreduced retirement is changed from age 55 with 20 years of service to age 60 with 20 years of
service
Early retirement reduction is changed from 5.0% from age 55 to 2.5% from age 60
The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 years to 25 years

– Sick and vacation payouts are no longer included in the pension benefit calculation
– Interest on employee contributions is changed from 5% to 3%

•

Due to amendment #22, a drop in the normal cost rate is expected as new hires
enter the plan.
– The normal cost last year was 10.31 % and this year it is 9.65%.
– Normal cost is expected to decrease to 5.18% in the long term.

1.C.1.a

RTD/ATU Summary
• Pension reform (Amendment #22) is decreasing the normal
cost but the unfunded is “outrunning” the solution
– Decrease in the normal cost while UAL payments grow faster
– Trust depletion date moved from 2035 to 2040

This is a highly volatile calculation; one year of poor returns could
bring that number much closer to today
m At depletion in 2040, benefit payments are estimated at $40 million
per year which is approximately 25% of projected payroll
m

– Asset losses (investments not meeting the assumed 7%)
continue to increase the unfunded accrued liability
m

There are $10.5 million in deferred market losses still to be recognized

– Contribution shortfalls continue to increase the unfunded
accrued liability

Quarterly Investment Report

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: August 14, 2018
Information

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the second quarter of 2018 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the second
quarter of 2018. The U.S. unemployment rate declined modestly over the period to 4.0% and general
inflationary pressures remained tame.
In order to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Federal
Reserve chose to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1.75% to 2.00% in June. The
Federal Reserve stated “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting
strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to two percent inflation”.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: August 8, 2018

From:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

GM

Date:

August 8, 2018

Board Meeting Date: August 21, 2018

Subject:

Award of Access-a-Ride Call Center Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of Access-aRide Call Center services with First Transit Inc. This contract is for three years, with two, one-year
options for a total five year amount not to exceed $15,114,226. This proposal represents the most
responsive and cost-efficient proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 18-DK-001,
to provide “Access-a-Ride Call Center” Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be
effective October 1, 2018.
This recommendation addresses two of the General Manager’s 2018 goals: Core Goal #3 Strong
Financial Management.
BACKGROUND
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public entities operating a fixed route system
also provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities that is comparable to the level of service
provided to individuals without disabilities. RTD adheres to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Part
37 regulations (Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities) which regulate paratransit services. All
policies regarding services were developed in concert with a Citizen Advisory Committee comprised of
individuals representing the disability community. The original design of the Access-a-Ride program was
adopted by the RTD Board of Directors and was forwarded to the Federal Transit Administration for their
approval.
The current Access-a-Ride structure consists of one Call Center Contractor and four Service Provider
Contractors. First Transit operates the Call Center while MV Transportation, VIA Mobility Services,
Transdev, and Transdev-On-Demand provide the service. In addition, all paratransit eligibility functions
are handled by Easter Seals of Colorado.
On May 25, 2018, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals to
provide Access-a-Ride Call Center Services. This service represents the re-bid of service currently
provided by First Transit. The RFP was mailed to 16 firms that indicated an interest in proposing on this
service. In addition, announcements were placed in transit publications. Proposals were due on June
25, 2018.
DISCUSSION
Four (4) proposals were received in response to RFP 18-DK-001 for the Provision of Access-a-Ride Call
Center services. Proposals were received from First Transit; Global Contact Services, LLC (GCS);
Midwest Paratransit Services, Inc., and 6e Tech.
It is the recommendation of the Evaluation Committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 18-DK-001, that RTD award a contract for Access-a-Ride Call Center service to First Transit Inc.
This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the proposals according to the evaluative criteria

Packet Pg. 48

2.B.1

as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established for this procurement
were: a) experience of the firm and key personnel in providing service similar in nature and agency size
(25%); b) system management (25%); c) training outline (15%); d) transition and start-up (5%); and e)
price (30%).
The Evaluation Committee consisted of Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services; Carolyn
Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; and Larry Buter, Manager, Paratransit Services.
The members of the Evaluation Committee individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by
the four proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the
evaluative criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Experience of the Firm and
Key Personnel in providing service similar in scope and agency size”; “System Management”; “Training
Outline”; and “Transition and Start-up.” Based on the average of the individual scores received in these
categories, Global Contact Services (GCS) was the highest rated technical proposal followed by First
Transit. 6e Tech ranked in third place followed by Midwest Paratransit Services, Inc. in fourth place.
The proposed costs per provider were as follows: First Transit $15,114,226; Global Contact Services,
LLC (GCS) $19,336,087; Midwest Paratransit Services, Inc., $10,977,722.63 and 6e Tech
$20,449,114. The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD
procurement staff and was then added to the technical score of each proposal to determine the overall
score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores resulted in First Transit Inc. being the highest
rated proposal followed by Global Contact Services (GCS) second place; Midwest Paratransit Services,
Inc. third place; and 6e Tech fourth place. It should be noted that despite Midwest Paratransit Services,
Inc. submitted the lowest bid, they did not meet the minimum evaluative criteria. First Transit received
an overall total score of 82.70 (out of 100); Global Contact Services received an overall total score of
77.4; Midwest Paratransit Services, Inc. received a total score of 62.47; and 6e Tech received an overall
score of 52.99.
The key strengths of the Global Contact Services (GCS) proposal included extensive experience
providing paratransit call center services for large transit agencies; a proposed management team with
prior experience in their areas of expertise; in-depth explanation for plans to review and refine service
delivery; workforce management; and cross training staff. The weaknesses of the Global Contact
Services (GCS) proposal included concerns about employee shift schedules and experience with
preparation of vehicle deployments.
The key strengths of the First Transit proposal included a high-level of experience with the proposed
service; a proposed management team with prior experience with the proposed service; in-depth
explanation of plan to meet RTD service standards; and proposed improvements to wages. Additionally,
there would be no need for startup and no disruption of service when transitioning to the new contract.
The weaknesses of the First Transit proposal included concerns about corporate support of the local
team and methodologies to ensure quality control.
The key strengths of the 6e Tech proposal included a detailed discussion of the training program and
hiring plan. The Evaluation Committee was concerned with the weaknesses of the 6e Tech proposal
which included a lack of applicable experience in scope, size, and complexity similar to the current Call
Center operations; several key management personnel were not identified; and limited discussion on
methodology to ensure quality control of Call Center operations and strategies to meet service
standards.
The key strengths of the Midwest Paratransit Services, Inc. proposal included experience providing Call
Center services; the experience of the proposed General Manager; and the proposed use of software

Packet Pg. 49

2.B.1

designed to improve efficiencies. The weaknesses of the proposal included a failure to identify several
key management personnel; a limited discussion on how service standards would be met; a limited
discussion on hiring, recruiting and retention of employee; and a failure to address how training
requirements would be met. Based on the proposals and interviews, the overall rating represents the
evaluation process conclusion that the strengths of the First Transit technical proposal outweighed the
strengths of the Global Contact Services; Midwest Paratransit Services, Inc.; and 6e Tech proposals.
It was the consensus of the Evaluation Committee that First Transit Inc. and GCS presented the best
proposals in terms of understanding of the project, proposed management team, proposed
organization/business plan/approach to deliver the requested service, training and transition plan.
Although First Transit provided the lowest priced proposal of the top two proposals, the Evaluation
Committee needed additional clarification on the proposals.
On July 23, 2018, the Evaluation Committee conducted in-person, oral interviews with the two
proposers who scored the highest, First Transit and Global Contact Services (GCS). While the strengths
of both the First Transit and Global Contact Services (GCS) proposals included experienced staff,
training, and operations, the Global Contact Services (GCS) costs exceeded both the internal cost
estimate for the operation of the ADA Call Center and the First Transit proposal. At the conclusion of
the oral presentations, proposers were given the opportunity to present a best and final offer. The
revised scores, which included the best and final pricing, resulted in First Transit receiving a score of
91.21 and Global Contact Services (GCS) receiving a score of 86.37. In addition, contracting with First
Transit saves the District a total of $4,221,861, which includes a savings of $220,716 in startup costs
given First Transit is also the incumbent.

It is recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter
into a contract for the provision of Access-a-Ride Call Center services with First Transit Inc. This
contract is for three years, with two, one-year options for a total five year amount not to exceed
$15,114,226. This proposal represents the most responsive and cost-efficient proposal received in
response to Request For Proposals (RFP) 18-DK-001, to provide “Access-a-Ride Call Center” Services.
The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective October 1, 2018.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
An RTD internal financial analysis indicated that the estimated cost to provide these services would be
higher than the prices offered by the recommended service provider. The estimated cost was based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience
operating the RTD Call Center in the Customer Care Division.
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the proposed 2019
budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the
2018 or 2019 budgets. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future
years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to First Transit, Inc., as recommended
2)
Award the contract to Global Contact Services (GCS), the second ranked proposer. This is
not recommended as it does not reflect the outcome of the Evaluation Committee’s
evaluation process and RTD’s procurement process.

3)

Resolicit the RFP. This is not recommended as the proposal process has resulted in a
responsive and cost-efficient proposal and is less expensive than the RTD internal cost
estimate (ICE).

HISTORY
Prior to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, County based Social Service
Agencies and E&D Transportation providers in the RTD District provided paratransit services for seniors
and individuals with disabilities.
These Providers included:
Ø Denver County - “Metro Mobility”
Ø Adams County - “North Metro Mobility”
Ø Boulder County - “Special Transit” (now known as VIA mobility)
Ø Jefferson County - “Senior’s Resource Center” (SRC)
Ø Arapahoe County - Ran a brokerage
Ø Broomfield County - Did not exist at that point in time - Broomfield County was created in 2001.
RTD provided a service know as “Handi-Ride”. Handi-Ride was a subscription service for people with
disabilities to travel to/from work.
These services were disbanded or modified subsequent to the passage of the ADA and RTD became
responsible for the provision of “complementary paratransit service” for individuals with disabilities in
accordance with the provisions of the ADA.
RTD began to provide “Access-a-Ride” service in January 1994.

PEER BEST PRACTICES
Shared-Ride Accessible Microtransit in Mobility Zones: Several software platforms
have emerged, most notably Via on the east coast and Chariot on the west. This
software is designed to emulate TNC, (Uber and Lyft), type services.
1. First generation was turnkey in several markets. Efforts included software,
vehicles and staffing.
2. Second generation Shared Ride pilot deployed in May of 2017 by Capital Metro in
Austin, TX.
3. Uber and Lyft are now also deploying similar “pool” vehicles in many urban
markets, but very few markets have accessible fleets.

Attachment: Innovation in Mobility on Demand (3550 : Innovative On Demand Services)

2.C.1.a

PEER BEST PRACTICES (CONTINUED)
Connection of Demand Response and Fixed Route service: RTD paratransit trips are, (by
virtue of our size), above average in length. This leads to our lowest productive service
costing more per trip fixed route or call-n-ride service.
1. Routematch has piloted a solution to combine their demand-response and fixed route
service. Ongoing use in York Region Transit has been successful.
2. Maximizing the identification of “best-fit” trips by a customer’s physical and cognitive
ability would be required.
Potential Replication with RTD paratransit customers: Ongoing work with Routematch to see
best how and when we may be able to move forward with testing.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (CONTINUED)
Micro-mobility devices as first- and last-mile solutions: Docked and dockless bikes; electric
bikes; and, more recently, electric scooters have “taken over” many urban environments.
They’ve been deployed in China, Los Angeles, and here in Denver.
Opportunity knocks, given we’re allowed to determine how best to situate these devices at
our own facilities such as park-and-ride’s, rail, and bus stations. Working with these
companies to assure they don’t block ADA access and boarding areas may allow us to capture
the millennial waive not quick to purchase cars.
Considerations to successful deployment include:
1. Support of lockable, dockless solutions as an alternative to throw-and-go.
2. Assure parking is clearly marked and available for these alternatives.
3. Outreach to Access committee and ADA population; not all disabilities are visible.
4. Future station and park-and-ride upgrades.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (CONTINUED)
MaaS transit: or Mobility as a Service is the provision of transportation
alternatives using a real-time model providing many types of mobility
choices in an integrated manner.
1. Smart phones already allow first-mile, last-mile micro-solutions
by placing all similar apps in a folder for easy use. These solutions
can, (and are), being shared or linked from other apps and
websites.
2. RTD already has a trip-planner which focuses on how to get from
one location to another within the service area using bus or rail.
Expanding the MaaS concept to replicate similar efforts in Europe
would allow a user to plan a trip from origin to destination using all
available transportation alternatives.

RTD HAS INNOVATIONS IN PROGRESS, A FEW EXAMPLES
Ø Trip Exchange – RTD (CnR & AaR), DRMAC, Via (Boulder), Senior Resources (JeffCo),
Broomfield Easy Ride and others, have developed a prototype electronic trip exchange
(HUB) and are in the process of testing it.
Ø Access-a-Ride • Fixed Route Integration – AaR conducted a pilot, using a manual
process, to test whether trips could be combined with fixed-route to more costeffectively serve AaR customer needs.

Comingling Fixed Route and Access-a-Ride will improve efficiencies and offer our passengers
greater flexibility and freedom

Ø Improved Access-a-Ride Scheduling - Conduct a pilot to test the feasibility of allowing
the scheduling software to maximize schedules throughout the course of the day.

CBA Related Service Changes – August 2018

DISCUSSION
The August 2018 Service Change adopted by the Board of Directors on June 26, 2018 contains some
service changes that were adjusted, due to CBA compliance. However, there are additional changes (not
contained in the August Service Change) to operations plans that do not affect public timetables, but do
have resource impacts relating to operator requirements and financial costs.
To better illustrate all the CBA related changes, which go in effect with the August 2018 Service
Change, the following list includes changes made to the now adopted service change and changes made
to service for compliance with the CBA not listed in the August 2018 Service Change Proposal:
Route 0: is not a part of the service change for August 2018, however, upon review of the schedule for
CBA compliance, additional resources were required for Weekday service. Anticipated resource impact
include an increase of 2,040 weekday hours annualized.
Route 43: is not a part of the August 2018 Service Changes, however, upon review of the schedule for
CBA compliance, additional resources were required for both Saturday and Sunday service. Anticipated
resource impact 1,100 weekend hours annualized.
STAMPEDE: this proposal was initially discussed as a resource savings, but after further review of the
schedule’s compliance with the CBA, the proposal was modified to reflect an increase in resource
requirements.
Route 209 – CU/Mohawk/Talbot
STAMPEDE – CU/East Campus
Service type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)

It is proposed to reduce the AM and PM peak frequency to 30 minutes versus the current 15 minute
frequency, as well as the current midday 30 minute frequency to 60 minute frequency, due to low
ridership. Maximum passenger loads per trip range from 1 – 18 passengers. The majority of the route’s
boardings and alightings occur between Colorado & 30th Street and Euclid & 18th Street (Eastbound
165/185 boardings, Westbound 193/210 alightings). This section of the route is duplicative to Route
STAMPEDE, which operates at 10 minute frequency or better, all day.
In cooperation with CU Boulder and City of Boulder, it is proposed to discontinue Route STAMPEDE
between Colorado/Discovery Drive and Marine Street and 30th Street. CU Boulder will provide
connections between these two locations via its Buff Route. Route frequency for Route STAMPEDE
would be every 10 minutes, 7am – 5:30pm and every 15 minutes 5:30pm – 7pm. Service span will be
expanded to 8:30pm to provide connections between CU Main Campus and East Campus, for evening
classes Additional frequency of 5 minutes would be maintained for major class start and end times, at
9:00am, 10:00am, noon, 2:00pm and 3:00pm. Anticipated resource impacts include an increase of
2,295 annual hours due to adjustments related to the new CBA.

Packet Pg. 65

2.C.2

D Line was not a part of the initial service change for August 2018, however, upon review of the
schedule for CBA compliance, additional resources were required for daily service. The proposal was
modified to include the following:
D Line – Mineral/18th& California
Responding to changes in the collective bargaining agreement, an adjustment is proposed to the
operations schedule of the D Line, resulting in the use of one more all day train. The additional cars
necessary to form the 3 car consist will come from a change of consist length (or the number of light rail
vehicles/cars assigned to a train) on both the L and R Lines. Both the L and R Lines ridership profiles are
such that peak ridership capacity does not exceed the capacity provided on one light rail one car.
Anticipated resource impacts include a cost of 4,598 annual hours
The anticipated financial impact of the changes not included in the August 2018 Service Change are
estimated to be $239,000 annualized. This would thereby reduce the anticipated savings of $1,924,000
to $1,685,000 annualized.

January 2019 Service Changes

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and resources allow.
Changes to RTD transit service, have historically been measured by and related to ridership and financial
impacts. However, current labor market conditions continue to be a serious challenge to the recruitment
and retention of bus and rail operators. More to the point, the amount of service being provided by
operators working on their days off is at a level that impedes employee retention efforts and makes it
difficult to meet our commitments to our customers. To better match the RTD’s scheduled service
offerings to RTD’s available workforce, this proposal starts a process to adjust the level of service on
various routes throughout the District. The proposed service adjustments were conceived in accordance
to the Service Policies and Standards adopted by the RTD Board of Directors.
The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions. Notable proposals include a
restructure of service to/from Longmont/East Boulder via Routes LD and 225. Additionally, a proposal to
merge Route 26 – West Yale with Route 35 - Hampden is also included. A reduction to service
frequency on the SKIP is also proposed. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of
these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service
change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 26 – West Yale Avenue/Route 35 – Hampden Avenue: merge Routes 26 and 35 into new
crosstown Route 35.

Route 0 - Broadway
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Standardize late night weekend trip times starting/ending inside Denver Union Station with
weekday trip times. This schedule simplification will continue to honor Denver Union Station
overnight closure times, but benefit walk-up and casual riders by having schedules that are more
consistent between the different service days, and easier to remember. Change northbound
routing through Downtown from Welton to Lawrence Street, thereby operating for a longer
segment on 15th Street and a shorter segment on 18th Street. This change is needed in an effort
to address traffic congestion impacts on on-time performance (see proposed change to Route
20). Additionally, a run time analysis is proposed to address certain early trips that have been
reported. Saturday and Sunday Collective Bargaining Agreement compliance related schedule
adjustments. Anticipated resource impacts are estimated to be an increase of 880 service hours
annualized.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Reroute into Denver Union Station instead of Elitch Gardens for operator recovery after 7:00pm
weekdays and all day on weekends. A possible operational savings, to be determined.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis, no resource impacts are anticipated.
Route 15 – East Colfax
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Move short turn recovery location from Oneida/Colfax to Leyden/Colfax, for operator restroom
access. Discontinue 1:21am westbound trip on Saturday and Sunday nights, which sees an
average of 9 and 11 boardings respectively. Alternative trips are available 15 minutes before and
after this trip. Possible running time adjustments. Anticipated resource impacts are estimated to
be a savings of 132 service hours annualized.
Route 16 – West Colfax
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Extend the Saturday and Sunday short-turn trips currently using Zephyr/14th terminal to the Oak
LRT Station. This is to address an operator respite problem with the Zephyr/Colfax short-turns.
Additionally, a running times analysis will be conducted. Anticipated resource impacts are
estimated to be an increase of 2,040 service hours annualized.
Route 16L – West Colfax
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
For existing trips currently terminating at 14th/Oak, extend them into Oak LRT Station. For
existing through-trips to Golden, deviate them into Oak LRT Station. This change would facilitate
a known gap in system connectivity. Running times analysis, directed at westbound trips
operating early. Anticipated resource impacts are estimated to be an increase of 2,040 service
hours annualized.

Route 20 – 20th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Change westbound routing through downtown from 15th St. to 18th St. This change is
associated with the Route 0 - Broadway change, so that Route 20 will operate on the segment of
18th St. abandoned by Route 0. This change will also reduce trip times on Route 20 westbound
short-turn trips operating as far as DUS, which crosses the 16th St Mall twice to reach DUS. This
change also more closely matches-up the routing of the short-turn westbound pattern in
Downtown with the through westbound pattern. (On weekdays, there are more short-turn trips
operating into DUS than thru trips, and all trips on weekends are short trips into DUS). No
resource impacts are anticipated.
Route 21 Iifff/Evans
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis, no resource impacts are anticipated.
Route 26 – West Yale Avenue
Route 35 – Hampden Avenue
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Merge Routes 26 and 35 into new crosstown Route 35. This change will provide through
connections to Nine Mile, Southmoor and Englewood Stations. No resource impacts are
anticipated.
Route 28 – 28th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis, no resource impacts are anticipated.
Route 32 – 32nd Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue 6:52am westbound trip. This trip carries 16 passengers, which does not meet the
service standard for 15 minute service. Alternative service can be found on trips 15 minutes
before and 12 minutes after the current trip time. Anticipated resource impact is estimated to be
a savings of 383 service hours annualized.
Route 46 – South Dahlia
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue Cherry Creek loop west of Steele Street, due to very low ridership (45 boardings on
27 trips averaged per weekday). Allows operator recovery at Adams/Ellsworth senior home. No
resource impacts are anticipated.
Route 131 – East Iliff/Seven Hills
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Adjust trip times and blocking for operator recovery. No resource impacts are anticipated.

Route 225/225D/225E – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US287
Route LD – Longmont/Denver
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Regional - (10% 11.3 pass. per hr./ 25% - 21.9 pass per hr.)
The CMAQ grant for the midday service on the Route LD is due to expire December 31, 2018.
Acknowledging the ridership patterns established on the Route LD, this proposal seeks to
promote network connectivity between US 36 communities and the Flatiron Flyer. More to the
point, the proposal reduces the focus on through trips to downtown Denver, which duplicate
Flatiron Flyer service on US 36 and are less sustainable without grant funding. Responding to the
loss of grant funding, the following is proposed:
Discontinue routing of Routes LD1 and LD2 south of US36 due to duplicative service with Route
FF and overall low ridership. Reroute service south of Lafayette Park-n-Ride via US287, (west)
Dillon Road, SH42 (96th Street), Interlocken Parkway, Via Vara and into US36 & Flatiron Station.
Increase service level frequency to 60 minutes all day, between 5:30am and 10:30pm, off-set
LD1 with LD3 (225) in the peaks, so that a 30 minute headway is created between both routes,
between 8th & Coffman Park-n-Ride and US287/ Dillon Road. Rename Route 225 between
Lafayette PnR and US36 & Broomfield Station to Route LD3 and reduce frequency between US36
& Broomfield Station and Lafayette PnR to hourly, maintaining the current service span. Off-set
with Route LD1 in the peaks, so to create a 30 minute headway between 8th & Coffman Park-nRide and US287/Dillon Road. Retain Route 225 between Downtown Boulder Station and
Mohawk/ Talbot. Move short-turn terminal from East Boulder Recreation Center to
Mohawk/Talbot and increase weekday peak frequency to 15 minutes, bi-directional. Anticipated
resource saving of 3,300 annual in-service hours, with no financial impact due to grant funding.
Route 228 – Louisville/Broomfield
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Extend Route 228 east to Hecla and 96th Street, into the Boulder County Kestrel Housing
complex. This will provide service to roughly 200 low-income residents. This will also provide a
required end-of route restroom facility to adhere to the new CBA. No anticipated resource impact.
Route AT – Arapahoe County/Denver Airport
Service type – Regional – (10%-11.3 pass. per hour / 25%-21.9 pass. per hour)
Respace southbound afternoon employee peak trips to depart Denver Airport at 2:45pm and
3:15pm, instead of current 3:10pm and 3:25pm. Based upon ridership data from other bus and
rail routes, 2:30pm is the larger employee quit time. No resource impacts anticipated.
BOLT – Longmont/Boulder
Service type – Regional – (10%-11.3 pass. per hour / 25%-21.9 pass. per hour)
Running time adjustments, no resource impacts anticipated.
Route FF/FF7 – Flatiron Flyer – Boulder/Denver
Service type – Regional – (10%-11.3 pass. per hour / 25%-21.9 pass. per hour)
Adjust running times and add 2 FF4 and 1 FF2 eastbound AM peak period trips to address current
overloads. Discontinue 2 FF3 eastbound trips at 9:07am and 11:31pm 2 westbound trips at
10:00pm and 11:00pm, due to very low ridership (3 – 9 boardings) and duplicate service via FF1.
CBA related schedule changes. Anticipated resource impacts to be determined.

Route RX – Brighton/ Denver Express
Service type – Regional – (10%-11.3 pass. per hour / 25%-21.9 pass. per hour)
Discontinue mid-day roundtrips (10:43am leave Adams County Justice Center and 12:09pm
leave Civic Center Station) due to very low ridership (less than 8 passengers per trip). Anticipated
resource impact estimated to be a cost savings of an estimated 638 service hours annualized.
Route SKIP – Broadway
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Current ridership performance overall exceeds the threshold to maintain 10 minute service
frequency during select portions of the service day. However, the majority of the peak period can
be accommodated by a 10 minute frequency. Consequentially, it is proposed to reduce to the
Route SKIP peak service frequency to 10 minute frequency from the current 7-8 minute peak
frequency, while retaining the current mid-day 10 minute frequency. This change will allow for
better on-time performance and a balancing of passenger loads, as well as address current CBA
layover/restroom challenges for the route. This proposal also supports additional short-turn
trippers between Fairview High School and 14th/Walnut, northbound between 3:00pm and
3:30pm to maintain current 7-8 minute frequency and address otherwise potential overloads
caused by BVSD and CU student ridership. No anticipated cost impact due to resource off-set.
Route Y – Boulder/ Lyons
Service type – Regional – (10%-11.3 pass. per hour / 25%-21.9 pass. per hour)
Discontinue mid-day roundtrips (10:57am and 12:20pm leave Downtown Boulder Station and
11:42am and 1:02pm leave Lyons Park-n-Ride) due to very low ridership (range of 3 – 4
passengers per trip). Anticipated resource impact is estimated to be 637 annual in-service hours

Below is a summary of the actions that were taken in regards to the I-25 Car Fire
Alignment Closure Incident on July 10, 2018.
Summary of After Action Briefing:




We were able to evaluate the process holistically, including customer service
elements (i.e. announcements on trains that were made, and station announcements
that were not made).
We were able to evaluate the system recovery process, discussed various options to
optimize the customer experience in the future.
We were able to evaluate various procedures (including evaluating new procedures
to enhance safety and customer experience).

What Went Well?
 The bus response was excellent.
 The communication from customer service was excellent.
 The safe operation of trains was good.
 Communication from control to operators was good.

What Didn’t Go Well?
 Notification to bus could have come faster (they responded to the rider alert, not a call
from OCC).
 Provided no customer service (i.e. train or bus service) south of Arapahoe Station for
an hour.
o Due to restrictions from the Fire Department and unsafe conditions on the
highway prevented a main artery to get busses to stations quickly.
o Rush hour/Peak hour was also a factor.
 Notification and Communication with AGM could have been better.
Action Items (Lessons Learned):
 Review notification procedures
o Completed.
 Review process of operator emergency exit on the right-of-way safely.
o In process. Completion by August 31st
 Create checklist for the Operations Control Center (OCC)
o Completion by August 31st
 Review process of controller procedures, including the interaction between bus and
rail. Review system recovery technique procedures.
o This is an on-going process that will continually be evaluated.

Re:

Service Availability - July 2018

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.57% of all scheduled hours of
bus service in July 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons showed a slight
decrease for the month of July over the same time last year. The year to date number
shows an increase over last year. Details as follows:





July 2018 – 251.48 hours
July 2017 – 315.28 hours
Year to date numbers 2017 – 1737.03 hours
Year to day numbers for 2018 - 8992.01 hours

While RTD did provide in excess of 99.57% of all scheduled hours of service in the
month, it was necessary to cover 2373 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 18,984 hours of service being
provided by a “6th day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours
provided by our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev.

Items to note include improvements in the vacancy rate, recruitment numbers and

Contributing to our service challenges in July were multiple bus bridges and special events.
Staff continues to work with Human Resources and other departments to address ways
to continue to improve recruitment and retention among bus operators.
