RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2018 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) as required by 49 CFR
Part 674 State Safety Oversight Regulations.
The recommended action proposed supports the following GM Goals:
Task Goal #3 Asset Management/State of Good Repair
DISCUSSION
The FTA created a new State Safety Oversight regulation 49 CFR Part 674 in 2016 and the Colorado
Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) was certified in April of 2018 making the new ruling effective in
August 2018. The new regulation replaced State Safety Oversight/System Safety Program Plan (SSPP)
regulation 49 CFR 659 which required transit agency’s to develop a System Safety Program Plan. The
new regulation requires Rail Transit Agencies to develop a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
(PTASP) based on a Safety Management System (SMS) framework that is signed by the Agency
Accountable Executive (General Manager and CEO) approved by the Board of Directors and then
submitted to the CPUC/State Safety Oversight Agency for certification annually.
However, the FTA only recently (July 2018) released the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
regulation 49 CFR Part 673 which requires agencies to develop and be compliant with a PUC approved
PTASP by July 20, 2020. As a result of the mismatched timing of the regulations, we are in a
transitional period, still technically under Part 659 SSPP as an Agency, but also technically beholden to
the new Part 674 regulation. Therefore, we are submitting an initial PTASP in the SMS Framework that
is a bridge document that includes all certified SSPP elements plus some additional SMS elements. We
are asking for your approval of this 2018 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, understanding that
it will meet all requirements for the current 49 CFR Part 659 SSPP requirements and the current PUC 49
CFR Part 674 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan transition requirements.
Financial Impact – There is no financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2018 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) to ensure
compliance with 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight regulations.
2. Do not approve the 2018 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) and RTD will not be
in compliance with 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight Regulations potentially forfeiting
government funding.
