participants. They estimated approximately 27 locations signed in with varying people
for each site.
 The Bus and Maintenance Roadeo was held last Saturday. The Chair was unable to
attend due to being on the campaign trail. Directors Daly, Malpiede and Tobiassen
attended. This was a well-attended family oriented event.
 Director Tobiassen reported on the accident-free day at Metro last week. This was a
great celebration.
 Director Cohen reported on the Tour de FasTracks bicycle ride at the West Corridor.
Approximately 300 people participated which provided a multi-generational aspect of
the families in this corridor. Director Hoy added this showed how the neighborhood is
being revitalized. The RTD team did a great public information job.

GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT
 General Manager Washington shared that he had been invited to participate in a
PPP conference held in Australia which was funded by the organization. This was
a conference of heavy hitters where he was able to share about the RTD PPP
success, the only transit P3 in North America. There was a high level of
participation from countries such as Asia, UK, Canada and Australia. Some of
the takeaways from the conference included the fact that they all had knowledge
about the RTD success in securing a $1.03B FFGA. They were also aware of the
financial challenges but understood that the global economic crisis has affected
everything. They did not understand the North/South discussion and found this
distracting to the success and progress of PPP. General Manager Washington
invited them to become active participants in PPP in North America in a real way.
General Manager Washington also obtained information on an alliance
infrastructure build out model which he plans to share later.
General Manager Washington has copies of the presentations which he will share
with the Board members.
 General Manager Washington indicated this is Carla Perez, AGM for
Administration, last week at RTD. She was given a standing ovation. He had
given a letter to the Board informing them of his planned restructure changes to
the administration department.
 General Manager Washington provided a report-out from the RTC meeting this
morning. He indicated that at the meeting, a friendly motion was made to table
the NATA resolution and to form a task force of regional stakeholders to put forth
a more comprehensive resolution. General Manager Washington indicated that he
shared his concerns for this resolution as tying the hands of RTD to move forward
in FasTracks.
