I.

Communications Outreach Strategy
Carla Perez kicked this off by saying there is a lot of work being done to review both external
and internal processes. They are looking at impacts and how they can be more effective.
She turned it over to Christina Tubb for more discussion.
Christina Tubb indicated they have been meeting with the SBE/DBE community and have
gotten a lot of feedback that is useful and specific for a need for more focused outreach
efforts. She identified three areas for that focus:
1. Revised Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Advisory Council Meetings—The feedback
from this Advisory Council was the information was not very effective and they did not
feel they had anything to take back to their base. The comments were they needed
more interaction, responsiveness, and training. This is not to say the past program
was not good but that we need to take it to another level.
2. Revise Network Newsletter to incorporate more RTD information and looking at ways
to reach all the communities.
3. Joint Venture Issues—One of the problems they are discovering is a lack of
understanding about joint venturing. Some of the businesses are entering into joint
business with non DBE’s which increases the risk since they cannot be properly
funded. RTD is planning a workshop to educate these businesses on how to joint
venture.
Chair Kemp thanked the Committee for taking DBE to the next level.
Director Cohen asked how do these DBEs apply for certification. He also wanted to know
what % of the DBEs have the type of qualifications needed and what is RTD doing to help
them to get what they need (i.e. what is the success rate and what are we doing to help?)
Phil Washington responded that the DBE certification is through the City and County of
Denver. DBE is a federally funded program whereas the SBE is more local. He stated that
what RTD does is to point them in the direction of support organizations that can help them to
get certified.
Christina Tubb responded that she could work with CDOT and the City and County of Denver
to get the information on the success rate.
Director Bagley requested more specifics (examples) on what was meant by “do more.”
Christina and Carla responded:
 Need more workshops
 Opportunity to interface with primes
 Information on type of work anticipated in large projects that may be coming through
so they can be prepared
 Constant educating of the DBE/SBE community-need to change the mindset to help
them understand that the business/programs need to be done within the context and
framework of FFGA and funding requirements. If we do not comply, we can affect
funding.
Director McMullen commented he has been on the DBE Committee for a number of years and
had felt some of the frustration stated by the DBEAC. He thanked then on raising the bar on
the quality of information they plan to deliver.
Director Tayer thanked the community and stated he was looking forward to monthly
updates. He queried about the criticism brought against DTP and have we looked into it.
Carla Perez responded that DTP is evolving and trying to figure out how to be more
responsive. They are looking at a number of approaches-there’s lots of conversation.
Director Tayer requested staff to keep an eye on things and to let the Board know.
Director Tobiassen wanted information on veteran SBE business and what they need to do to
qualify.
Director Malpiede commented this is an opportunity for all the Board members to get educated
on our DBE/SBE programs and activities and to be able to articulate on the subject. They

would like Board members to submit their questions and concerns to the committee similar to
the online survey monkey tool that Tobiassen is using for the Operations and Customer
Services Committee.
Director Brohl reiterated this affects funding.
II. Other Matters
There were no other matters.
III. Adjourn
The meeting adjourned to the Operations and Customer Service Committee at 6:55 p.m.
