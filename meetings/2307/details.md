#### A. Award of Contract for Group 26 Fixed Route Service

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Interim General Manager, or his designee, be authorized to enter into a contract with First Transit for the provision of contracted fixed-route transit services in the Boulder and Longmont areas. This package of service, named “Group 26”, represents the re-bid of service currently operated by First Transit under a contracted service package named “Group 22.”

This contract is for three years plus two one year extensions for a total of five years.  The total not-to-exceed five year contract total amount is $63,168,544 for service and $7,019,978 for fuel.  This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 15-DH-064 to provide “Group 26” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on January 17, 2016.

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the July 28, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, reminded the Board that RTD has contracted out some of our services for a number of years.  These service packages are labeled as “Groups” as a way for staff to keep track of services.  He said the services are in the Boulder and Longmont areas.  The service package is named “Group 26” and represents the re-bid of service currently operated by First Transit.

Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services noted that a Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on May 1, 2015.  RTD received four (4) proposals from First Transit, MV Transportation, National Express Transit and Trandsdev.  The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored each proposal based on understanding and approach as well as experience, qualifications and safety record.  The small business office reviewed the SBE aspects of the proposals while the procurement department provided scores for pricing.  She reiterated that scores from the technical evaluation team were provided independent of cost.  Carolyn Conover explained that First Transit had the highest rated proposal.

Director Folska thanked staff for being responsive to the Board’s request of including both the pros and cons for each proposal in the Board Report.

Director Lubow echoed Director Folska’s comment.  She thought having both the concerns as well as the strengths really helped in her analysis.  She questioned the weakness identified in the First Transit proposal of not having a dedicated customer service representative.  She wondered if there was a dedicated person in the past.  She recognized this being a very important position but inquired if it needed to dedicated.  Greg Smith, Manager of Competitive Services, explained that a dedicated customer service representative was a requirement of the RFP; however, this is something that staff will be working with First Transit Management to fulfill.  He believes it is a very important job and component of the RFP.

Director Solano expressed his disappointment at not being able to meet with the employees of First Transit directly.  Bruce Abel explained that RTD as an organization needs to be extremely sensitive to the fact that while we work with our contractors, they are independent businesses.

Committee Chair Anderson recognized that this seems like a good contract for RTD as it will save money when compared with operating the service ourselves.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

#### B. US 36 BRT Service Plan - January 2016

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the US 36 BRT (Flatiron Flyer) Service Plan package as revised and summarized in Attachment A, resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $991,000 funded through FasTracks and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the July 28, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel apologized to the Board for inadvertently having an outdated chart in Attachment A that was included in the Board packet.  The chart indicated that Express service would operate at 15 minute frequencies instead of 10 minutes.  He noted that the narration was accurate and that the chart would be updated prior to the Board Meeting on July 28, 2015.  He asked Nate Diaz, Service Planner and Scheduler, to review the highlights of the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Service Plan.

Nate Diaz reminded the Board that the goal was to create a service plan that took advantage of the highway improvements such as express travel lanes, transit signal priority, queue jumps, etc.  He reiterated that the main guiding principles for the development of the US 36 BRT Service Plan are: 1) reduced travel time, 2) improved service reliability, 3) increase customer comprehension/ease of use and 4) match service levels with ridership demand.  It is important for the All Station Service to have 15 minute frequencies to allow for spontaneous use of the service.

Bruce Abel noted that the Board members had received a variety of correspondence from a variety of stakeholders and constituents.  He reiterated that staff included the requests that made sense at this time and will continue to monitor the service.

Chair Sisk thanked all the staff that have taken part in this exhaustive process.  He hopes that RTD will continue to listen to our stakeholders as we have been doing.   He expressed concerns about monitoring the service needs of Boulder Junction and mid-day express service and asked staff to keep an eye on the demand.  Chair Sisk believes this will be a great service for everyone.  He said that at this time he will vote no to keep the item open for discussion as he knows there are people that want to speak to it at the Board Meeting.

Director Folska echoed Chair Sisk’s thanks to the staff that worked on this.  She shared that she used to ride between Denver and Boulder sometimes multiple times a day.  She thinks it is really important to keep at least one express bus running every hour throughout the day.  She understands that it is only an estimated 10 minute difference between the express and all-station service, but 10 minutes makes a difference.  She asked staff to try and make mid-day express service happen.  She believes there is always a demand for that.  Bruce Abel noted that while mid-day express service has been an ask, it is not an element in the current Service Plan.  It is staff’s perspective that all station service is only 5 minutes slower than current mid-day express service so it is more important to have 15 minute service frequencies that integrates the corridor.  Director Folska wondered what the point of having BRT service is if it does not get you somewhere any faster.

Director Lubow thanked staff for the very commendable job they have done in meeting with stakeholders and the community.  She feels it has been a very extensive process and she is very happy with the outcome; however, she lives in this area and it is never far from her mind that there is still no Northwest rail.  It is the elephant in the room in her District.  She is concerned that RTD is not putting money aside toward the line as a way to show people we are serious about it.  Director Lubow said that she also feels it is important for RTD to go above and beyond in providing BRT service because they are not getting the rail service they were expecting.  She stated that for those two reasons she would be voting no as a protest vote but she does feel that staff has done a stand up job with the funding available.

Director Francone noted that while she does not live in the US36 area she hears about it all the time.  She said that in District N they would be delighted to have bus service every 15 minutes.  She shared that at the Transportation Legislative Review Committee (TLRC) held earlier in the day there were several legislators that expressed similar concerns about mid-day express service.  Director Francone thinks that staff’s explanation sounds very reasonable so she hopes they will reach out to the TLRC with the same information.  She said that she would like this item to remain open for discussion so she will be voting no.

Director Solano commented on a recent article about the dilemma with the Northwest Rail Line just looking like a pipe dream.  He is concerned that throwing more money at BRT moves RTD further and further away from the Northwest Rail so he will be voting no.

Director Bagley recognized why Chair Sisk was voting no to keep the conversation open; however, he wonders what Chair Sisk’s general perspective is of the plan being proposed.  Chair Sisk said he thinks the plan is resoundingly good.  He believes staff has done a great job of really listening to the community while keeping in mind what is best for RTD.  He stated that he looks forward to supporting this plan at the Board meeting.  He acknowledged that there are still some questions being asked and he hopes those will be addressed over the next few weeks.

Director Bagley said that it is his assumption that everyone had read the article about the Northwest Rail in the Denver Post.  He congratulated the Denver Post for hitting an inside the park homerun with the accuracy of the article.

Director Tobiassen remembers not that long ago that RTD did not know how we were going to get US 36 BRT done and now it is almost ready to be opened.  He noted that there are some operational details that need to be worked out over time but overall it is so exciting to see this done.  He commented that this is a major change for the US 36 corridor and change is hard, but when people look back they will wonder how they ever survived without it.  He asked staff if the concern about the bike capacity on the BRT buses had been addressed.  He feels that is a bigger concern than mid-day express service.  Bruce Abel stated that buses would continue to have a combination of bike racks as well as the ability to utilize the bays.  With the increased number of buses per hour there will also be an overall increase in bike capacity for the corridor.

Director Hoy thinks that staff has come up with a good plan.  He shared that he does have some concern about no mid-day express service but he would not propose adding it at the expense of the all station service.  He believes that RTD gives a greater number of people the option to ride when we stop the buses more often.  Director Hoy cautioned that the all station service will ultimately be about 10 minutes slower that the new express service.  He thanked staff for postponing the Route AB problem, at least until the Airport Line is open.  Director Hoy noted that the service plan had an annualized cost of approximately $991,000.  He wondered how that compared to the cost today.  Bruce Abel explained that $991K would be in addition to the costs today.  He pointed out that this is an increase of at least 10% in terms of revenue hours.

Director Hoy acknowledged that there are many Directors voting no to keep the dialog going.  He said that he too was going to vote no; however, it only takes one no vote to keep the dialog open.  He is concerned that the dialog might go indefinitely with how many Directors will be voting no.  He will be voting in favor of the service plan as he wants to make sure everyone gets the opportunity to talk about it again at the Board Meeting.

Director Lasater asked for a point of clarification as he understood Chair Sisk to indicate that he would allow public comment during the discussion of this item in addition to the usually held public comment period during the Board Meeting.  This would be contrary to what is normally allowed for public comment.  Chair Sisk apologized for giving Director Lasater that impression.  He said it is not his intention to change the Board Meeting policies at all.  He simply wants to allow for Directors to have an opportunity to speak about this again.

Director Walker stated that he would be supporting this service plan.  He reminded everyone that staff adjusts schedules every three months, so changes can be made as needed.

Director Lubow shared that there were several comments in a letter from the City of Boulder about continuing to work cooperatively with RTD staff to develop transportation and partnership opportunities that really resonated with her.  She has been very impressed by the transportation in Boulder and urges staff to continue to work with them.

Committee Chair Anderson shared that she has worked with members of the Boulder community for a very long time on transportation issues.  She complimented staff for working through this huge, huge BRT service plan.  She cannot express how excited she is at beginning BRT service.  Committee Chair Anderson thinks this is the launch of one of the most fascinating BRTs in the whole country.  She said that perhaps the service will not be perfect on opening day, but staff will monitor it and work hard to make it outstanding.  She recognized staff’s dedication to making this a first-class BRT.  She believes that it would be a travesty for the Board to not approve this service plan because of all the years that people have put in to make this dream come true.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

#### A. Fare Task Force Update (no backup)

Bruce Abel explained that staff has continued to evaluate the pass programs since the Board approved the new fare policy structure and rates.  They also are continuing to review the non-profit agency program reduced fare program with the affordable fare task force.  He said that staff anticipates coming back to the Board next month with a more substantive presentation.

Director Folska noted that at the Transportation Legislative Review Committee (TLRC) meeting one of the representatives inquired about the structure of the affordable fare task force (i.e. is it ad hoc, when will it disband, who makes up the committee, etc.).  She asked if staff could provide the Board with a better understanding of the task force so they could better explain it themselves.  Bruce Abel said there were some questions he could not answer, such as how long it will exist.  He explained that it consists of a variety of public and non-profit entities.  He said he would provide the Board with a full membership list.

#### B. 2016 Pre-Opening Campaign - Rail and BRT (no backup)

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, said that staff wanted to provide a high level overview of the campaign process for all the 2016 grand openings.  He explained that one of the goals of the campaign was to create an initial impression that something big is coming.  The campaign will provide on overall focus on the progress RTD is making on FasTracks as well as focus on the individual corridors as they open.  He reiterated that the closest any other openings have been was one year apart so this will be the shortest timeframe RTD has ever had between openings.

Steve Reilly, Marketing Communications Manager, explained that marketing’s jobs is to create awareness and excitement about our new lines all while educating people about schedules, how to ride, safety, etc.  He said that the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service, which is the first corridor that will be opening next year, really has an interesting construct as the vehicle will really be the star of that campaign.   Staff began by just introducing the vehicle but are now really starting to highlight the opening date and attributes of the service.  Steve Reilly said the next big push will be in July and August with the opening of Boulder Junction and then will continue to ramp up as we build to opening.

Scott Reed thanked the stakeholders who worked with us on the design of the Flatiron Flyers.  He commented that when we first started this process he could only think of the saying that a camel is a horse designed by a committee; however, the process with the stakeholders was really great and resulted in a wonderful design.  Steve Reilly echoed Scott’s sentiments.  He shared that it was a two year process but generated a very unique and innovative look for the vehicles while still being in-line with RTD’s brand.

Steve Reilly said the next thing the marketing department is working on is the commuter/light rail pre-campaign.  He shared that right now the marketing team has a window of opportunity being between BRT events so they have been working on something to help people understand what is coming and how it will affect them.  One of the goals is to get people educated about the line designations.  He stated that the team has been playing with the concept of size in developing the campaign since this is such a monumental undertaking for RTD.  Additionally, they have worked with circles to convey motion along with the specific letter and color designation for each line.  He shared that the ads are running in community publications such as Westword and the Denver Post, online and on our vehicles as well.

Steve Reilly shared that the last marketing effort staff had worked on was revamping the existing RTD FasTracks website.  It really incorporates the overall marketing efforts as well as spotlights important aspects of each corridor with their own page.

Director Folska shared that she had two ideas that came to her as she listened to the presentation.  The first was as a result of some feedback the Board received during a recent focus group session.  She suggested as we move forward perhaps partnering with CDOT on a billboard campaign with a slogan along the lines of “if you are tired of sitting in this congestion get on the train”.  She said that another idea might be to partner with a craft brewery along the corridors to make a commemorative beer/label for the openings.

Committee Chair Anderson believes there is actually a brewery in Arvada that has a Gold Line Beer.

Director Lasater asked what line is the B-Line.  Scott Reed said this was the first segment of the Northwest Rail Line up to Westminster.

Director Archuleta commented that during the entire presentation he heard no mention of doing anything in Spanish.  He expressed concern as that is such a big audience.  Scott Reed explained that the ads are running in several Spanish magazines.  He said that Spanish translations of all our marketing materials, schedules, maps, etc. are a key component of our overall marketing strategy.  Steve Reilly noted that we do not have the literature yet for widespread distribution but when we do Director Archuleta will be able to see the Spanish versions.

#### C. Intercity Commuter Express (Bustang) (no backup)

Bruce Abel introduced David Krutsinger, CDOT Project Manager, and asked him to review the highlights of the upcoming Bustang Bus Service.

David Krutsinger shared that beginning Monday, CDOT will operate six round trips per day to Fort Collins and Loveland, seven round trips per day to Colorado Springs, and one round trip per day to Glenwood Springs.  He thanked all the Board members for their support of the service and participation in some of CDOT’s preview events.  He also thanked the RTD Service Planning and Legal departments for their assistance in making this service possible.

Director Lasater noted that as a parent of a Colorado State University student is would be nice if there was one trip coming to Denver on Saturday and a trip returning to Fort Collins on Sunday.  He encouraged CDOT to work with CSU to see if there might be some indicator that this service is warranted.

Director Bagley congratulated CDOT in their efforts to provide intercity bus service.  He believes this is a tremendous addition to the service provided by RTD.  He recognized how important the collaboration is between CDOT and RTD.

Director Menten asked who manufactured the Bustang buses and wanted to confirm that RTD was not contributing to this service financially.  She also wondered what contractors provided this service prior to CDOT beginning its offerings.  David Krutsinger stated that MCI manufactures the buses and all funding for the service comes from the State.  He explained that the Bustang Bus Service was designed to complement the existing service provided by private contractors in the corridors and does not complete with them.  Director Menten asked for confirmation that CDOT believes these corridors were not served previously and that CDOT is not competing with the free market.  David Krutsinger said that was correct.

Director Folska shared that when she participated in one of the inaugural rides she found the bus to be so stunning and comfortable.  She is very excited she can now travel to Fort Collins on her own.  She agreed with Director Lasater’s point that there will be no service to Fort Collins on Sunday.  Director Folska thought it would be very grand if there could be some tours scheduled with the TLRC.  She noted Representative Kraft Thorpe was curious how the funding CDOT dedicates for transportation was allocated.  Interim General Manager Genova thought the question was related to Senate Bill 228 funds.  David Krutsinger explained that Senate Bill 228 funds have 10% designated for transit.  The projects that CDOT’s Transportation Commission considers are throughout the State, including collaboration with RTD.  He noted that the list of projects was not final so there was still an opportunity for discussion.  Director Folska hopes that CDOT can share that information with the TLRC members.  She shared that she loves the collaboration between CDOT and RTD on a whole host of different activities and thanked David Krutsinger for being here this evening.

David Krutsinger thanked the Board for their time.  He looks forward to making more connections and furthering collaboration across the State.  He said he would take Director Folska’s suggestion from earlier in the evening about the CDOT billboards back to his team.

#### D. Asset Management and State Of Good Repair Presentation

Interim General Manager noted that periodically the Asset Management team provides the Board with updates.  He introduced Jim Sutton, Manager of Asset Management, and Lou Cripps, Asset Management System Administrator, who reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the July 7, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

Jim Sutton explained that Transit Asset Management is a strategic and systematic process through which RTD procures, operates, maintains, rehabilitates, and retires transit assets.  The purpose is to manage the asset’s performance, risks and costs over the lifecycle to provide safe, cost-effective, and reliable service to current and future customers.  He noted that per MAP-21 requirements agencies will be required to provide the FTA with a Transit Asset Management Plan (TAMP), asset inventories, condition assessments, performance metrics, backlog information, State of Good Repair (SGR) score reports and comparisons year to year.  He said that RTD is compliant with the current rules.

Director Francone inquired as to the definition of backlog.  Jim Sutton defined backlog as any asset considered not in a State of Good repair with a score of 2.5 or lower on a 5 point scale.  That is when an agency needs to decide if an asset should be replaced or repaired.  Interim General Manager Genova noted that the FTA estimates that backlog across the nation is approximately $86 billion in assets so it is a very considerable amount.  He stated that the good news is that from the assessments done so far we do have some sub fleets with lower scores but all those fleets are either in replacement or scheduled for replacement soon.

Director Francone asked for a copy of the Asset Management State of Good Repair Annual Report.  Jim Sutton said that it was not yet finalized but staff would send to the Board when it was ready.  He anticipates this will be within the next few weeks.

Director James pointed out that there seems to be a trend with in-service delay hours increasing.  He wonders what staff is doing to address this.  Jim Sutton commented that there seems to be a cyclical trend for this metric.  Research shows that the cause is coming from assets that are scheduled to be replaced.  As there are large groups of rolling stock that move into end of life the in-service delay hours get worse.  As the new assets come online these delays should decrease.  He said that the Asset Management team also works with the Maintenance divisions to see if there are any underlying causes that can be addressed.  Lou Cripps stated that to staff’s knowledge there are no other transit agencies currently trying the impact of an asset’s score on ridership.  He shared that staff recently presented on this at the APTA rail conference and were approached by the FTA about the program.

Director James inquired if he was correct that the Asset Management program started prior to MAP-21.  Jim Sutton stated that was correct.  At the 2010 Board and Senior Leadership Team Advance this was established as a goal for the General Manager.  He explained that it was started as a pilot program that was then accepted as a long term department.  Director James said it sounds like what generated this program was in part a mandate by the FTA and in part good common sense.  Jim Sutton agreed with that assessment.  The Board and Senior Leadership Team saw a need for this type of program.  When the regulations were established there were some changes from the initial plan but overall RTD had a good start on the program.

Director Bagley stated that the issue of State of Good Repair is critical because it relates directly to safety which is RTD’s number one priority.  He shared that Director Anderson and he were just in Salt Lake City at the APTA Rail Conference and they have a number of sessions on State of Good Repair.  He noted that RTD is very lucky because our rail system is relatively new; even though we may need to update some things we are way ahead of the older systems, especially as it relates to Positive Train Control.  Director Bagley said he was recently in Boston and they can no longer get parts for their trains so they must manufacture everything themselves.  Director Bagley reiterated that safety and State of Good Repair is critical.

Director Hoy wondered if staff’s analysis would ever allow for a macro view of buses or light rail vehicles to determine that perhaps some of the older vehicles are actually performing better than newer ones.  He said it is his experience that the oldest truck is not necessarily the worst truck.  Jim Sutton stated that it was absolutely possible to get to that granular level.  The data will be used to pick the worst offenders to retire first.

Director Folska thanked staff for their detailed report.  She pointed out that the system staff is using for managing the Asset Management Plan is one that was build in-house.  She wondered if staff had thought about applying for a patent to license to other transit agencies.  Jim Sutton said that staff extending an invitation to other agencies to come and look at our system but staff had not considered patenting it.  Director Folska hopes that is something RTD will consider.  The agency needs to look to create other revenue sources.  She asked why we should give something away if we can make money from it and further support our State of Good Repair.

Committee Chair Anderson expressed how proud she was of staff at the APTA Rail Conference she attended.  It was clear how much our staff is looked upon because of their hard work.  She is very excited about our Asset Management program because she thinks it will help RTD make better decisions in the future on where to spend our scarce resources.

### D. Other Matters

Director Walker reminded everyone that the APTA Transit Board Member and Board Support Seminar would be taking place in 11 days.  He said that as of July 1 there were 157 registered attendees, which is more than in the last 10 years.  He recognized Paula Perdue and the marketing staff for all of their efforts; thanks to them the conference is really going to be amazing.  Director Walker hoped the Board Members had their assignments and were ready to show off what RTD has done.  He shared that he and Paula Perdue did a dry run of some of the tours and they all look very good.  He stated that this is looking like it will be a very successful conference.

Director James shared that he attended the Transportation Legislation Review Committee briefing along with several other Directors.  He thought Chair Pro Tem Tobiassen and Interim General Manager Genova gave a terrific update.  He said it was very educational and encouraged other Directors to consider attending in the future.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 7:39 p.m. to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee.
