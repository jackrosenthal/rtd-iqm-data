BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Finance and Planning Committee Work Plan

January 16, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
At the Study Session on October 18, 2023, the Board of Directors discussed the idea of annual
committee work plans.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Per the Board’s Bylaws (Article VI, Section 1, d.), the Finance and Planning Committee is “responsible
for agency financial matters, including but not limited to budget and monthly financial statement review,
determination of the fiscal impact of all Board actions, asset management, and long-range planning and
capital projects.”
DISCUSSION
The Committee is asked to review the attached draft work plan and gain an understanding of the
committee’s workflow based on the items currently listed. Additionally, the Directors should provide
input on items they would like to see included in the work plan that are not already included in the draft
document.
Following the discussion, senior staff will work with the Chair and Vice Chair of the committee to further
refine the work plan. The Committee will then review the work plan for approval at the February 13,
2024 meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.

Packet Pg. 3

1.G.1

This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Finance and Planning Committee’s ability to effectively govern
directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. A solid committee work plan will ensure RTD’s
resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are more focused,
collaborative, and obtainable.
