Special Recognition – American Diabetes Association Health Champion

Chair Sisk asked Heather Copp, Assistant General Manager for Finance and Chief Financial Officer, to present the American Diabetes Association Health Champion Award to the RTD Wellness Team.  Heather Copp introduced Jim Jacobsen, Manager for Wellness and Physical Therapy, and DeAnna Mathis, Wellness Rehabilitation Specialist.  Heather Copp reminded the Directors that the Wellness staff includes a Physical Therapist; however, all the planning, activities, and follow ups are done by Jim Jacobsen and DeAnna Mathis.  She pointed out that RTD is one of 8 recipients of this award in Colorado and one of 103 nationally.  Chair Sisk thanked them for their work as it is vitally important for RTD.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Sisk reminded the speakers they would have three minutes to address the Board and asked that they be respectful of their fellow participants.

- Stacy Gilmore stated that she is the Council Woman representing District 11 for the City and County of Denver which encompasses Northeast Park Hill, Stapleton, Montbello, Parkfield, Gateway, Green Valley Ranch and Denver International Airport.  She shared that earlier in the day she attended a panel where U.S. Transportation Secretary Foxx talked about the importance of connecting different modes of transportation together to have a robust network.  She noted that in District 11 the 61st and Pena TOD station is not yet operational.  Additionally, operation of the A-Line will not begin until April 22, 2016.  She asked the Board to postpone the decision related to the changes in the bus routes in Montbello and Green Valley Ranch until at least the A-Line is open.  Delaying the changes would allow for a full evaluation with all data to work together to make a good decision for the community.

- Anne Garcia, Chief Financial Officer at Rose Community Foundation and Mile High Connects Steering Committee Member, thought it was great to see some of RTD’s wonderful employees being recognized.  She said she was here this evening to talk about RTD’s low income riders.  Mile High Connects has been part of the affordable fares task force, which is comprised of agencies that believe in the importance of fare affordability for low income riders throughout the District.  She noted that recently the Affordable Fares Task Force had been very focused on a proposed 50% discounted bus pass for low income riders at 150% of the federal poverty level.  The Affordable Fares Task Force recognizes that there are many ways to get to provide affordability.  She noted that the Affordable Fares Task Force has made recommendations for the nonprofit agency reduced fare program.  She said they are very pleased to see that this feedback has made it into the recommendation and encouraged the Board to approve the changes; however, this program currently serves only 8.6% of RTD’s lowest income riders.  Even with the expansion it will only meet a fraction of the needs of the community.  She stated that the Affordable Fares Task Force calls on RTD to make a 50% low income pass available to all who need it.  She said that Mile High Connects and its partners are actively fundraising to support a match for a low income pass but it is very difficult since RTD has not allocated any funds to this program in the 2016 Budget.  She asked the Board to make sure there was a commitment from RTD in 2017 for a low income fare program.

- Yolanda Begay, 9 to 5, read the words to America the Beautiful as written by Katharine Lee Bates during a trip to Pikes Peak.  She said it is not surprising that the Denver Metro area has become one of the most desired places to live in 2015 but there has been tremendous growth in a very short period of time.  She pointed out that RTD had recognized this by expanding service and stations throughout the metro area.  She commented that many beautiful neighborhoods are being reconstructed with new and expensive high rises, but because of gentrification, many people are being displaced from these neighborhoods.  She said these are hardworking people making only $8.23 per hour or around $17K per year before taxes.  In Colorado rent on average for a two bedroom apartment costs $1,718 or around $21K per year.  She asked how someone making $8.23 per hour can afford to live in the Denver Metro Area.  She also wonders how RTD expects people making $8.23 to be able to afford to ride if RTD keeps raising fares.  She stated that if RTD continues to raise fares without considering an affordable, income based pass then RTD is suppressing a group of people which is a form of violence.

- Julie Bennett, 9 to 5, said that she is currently staying in a homeless shelter but will have her own place soon.  She thanked RTD for at least considering working with nonprofit agencies but also asks that RTD work with the people that cannot get to a nonprofit agency to access affordable fares.  She hopes RTD will create an income based pass for them as well.  She shared that her sister works for Denver Public Schools and indicated that there have been an increase in absenteeism because parents cannot afford the bus fare to take their kids to school.  She urged the Board to work with these families and individuals that need help.

- Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, 9 to 5, said that her organization and many others are happy to see there are recommendations for changes to the nonprofit agency reduced fare program but reiterated that affordable transportation cannot stop there.  RTD needs to have a more extensive reach for people who need a discount through an income based pass program.

She said that she was also here this evening to stand in solidarity with Green Valley Ranch and Montbello in asking for a delay in changes to the bus routes in those communities.  She expressed that many people did not feel their input was heard during RTD’s service change public meetings.  She noted that at public hearings for service changes, an RTD staff member takes notes of the comments.  She believes that if RTD is not willing to record these meetings or have a professional note taker then RTD is clearly demonstrating that these meetings are not being taken seriously.  She asked for a six month impact report from when the A-Line opens before any changes in service are made for this community.

Andrea Chiriboga-Flor said she was also here to share the story of one of 9 to 5’s members who could not attend.  This member relies on public transportation but with prices going up it would be hard for her to even maintain a job.  To save money this member rides her bike to work when the weather is nice and takes the bus home.  This member is a single mom who lives in public housing.  She has a BSA but it is difficult to find a job due to arranging childcare.  Currently this member works 16 hours per week but it is a temporary job.  If this member purchased a day pass every day for $5.20 it would end up costing $104, which is the equivalent of one week’s pay.  This member thinks that nonprofit agencies are already providing services to the community but are forced to buy nonprofit passes.  This member expressed that these nonprofits are not a bus service, RTD is.  This member does not think that providing affordable fares should be the responsibility of nonprofits.

- Veronica Marshall, Denver, is a student at Florence Crittenton High School and a teen mom.  She said she takes the bus to school and work.  She lives in a shelter and does not have a lot of money.  She is trying to save to provide a future for her and her daughter but it is difficult.  She often works late shifts and spends most of her money on cabs.  She stated that she needs a 50% discount.  There are many more people than just her trying to survive with children and perhaps with RTD’s help they can begin to build a better future for their families.

- Adam Dempsey, Windsor Gardens, asked the Board to postpone the proposed service change for Route 3 at the Alameda and Havana Park-n-Ride.  He asked how anyone could be opposed to a four minute deviation but said there is more than what meets the eye at that Park-n-Ride.  He stated that when the Route 3 service was reduced during service changes about four years ago and service was reduced going to Havana and Mississippi, staff told the riders to use the prevailing bus stops.  Adam Dempsey shared that the community came to the Board meeting at that time and pointed out a safety issue was raised by having seniors with walkers cross out of the Alameda and Havana Park-n-Ride across eight lanes of traffic to get to the Route 105 going southbound; as a result RTD put a bus stop on the south side of Alameda, thereby removing the safety issue.  He explained that changes posed today will create the same safety issue but in the opposite direction.  People who are exiting the Route 105 northbound will have to cross those same eight lanes of Havana to access the Route 3.  He hopes the Board will delay this change until they can get a better look at the safety issues it creates.  He believes that the four minutes savings created from this change can be found elsewhere along Route 3.

- Angela Cobian, Community Organizer for Together Colorado, said she was here supporting the efforts of the Affordable Fares Task Force and Mile High Connects.  She hopes that the points made by Veronica Marshall really illustrated the trials and tribulations she faces every day as a young woman and mother.  She stated that she supports the recommended changes to the nonprofit agency reduced fare program but it does not go nearly far enough given that wages have been stagnant for the last 40 years.  She believes that RTD needs to catch up to its peer in Seattle in terms of offering an income based discounted fare program.  She also hopes RTD will consider offering free public transportation to the My Denver card.  She reiterated that she applauds the steps RTD is taking but they do not go far enough.

- Steve Albers, Gunbarrel, wanted to follow-up on some of the comments he made about Route J.  This service was started about 25 years ago at the requested of the Department of Commerce to serve the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Gunbarrel and Longmont.  He noted that the population of Gunbarrel is growing which bodes well for the overall health of the Route J.  He noted that the proposal would terminate Route J sooner on the southbound service, right at the CU campus.   He believes the bus would proceed anyway on Broadway after the proposed termination; therefore it would be of little impact to retain one or more stops southbound on Broadway.  Similarly, he thinks the evening northbound routes could consider staging at Baseline and Broadway.  Both of these recommendations would mitigate some of the shortening of the Route J.  He noted that ridership is better during the school year and recommended only discontinuing the 6:03 p.m. northbound trip during the summer.  He said these also reflect the comments of a number of his colleagues, which he does not believe are reflected in the information that was provided to the Board.

- Doug Gragg, Denver, commented that he rides Routes 10, 0, 15, and 20 and often chats with many of his fellow riders.  He shared that everyone he speak with thinks it is criminal extortion to raise the already very high bus rates.  He said that he was at a recent RTD Board of Directors Committee meeting at which there was discussion of moving the 16th Street Mall Shuttle to 15th and 17th Street.  He highly encouraged the Board to not give into the City of Denver as getting between 15th and 17th can be quite burdensome.  He said it is so tiresome he is more likely to just stay home.

- Daniela Villarreal, Community Organizer for Rights for all People, said that her organizations is also in support of an income based pass.  She explained that her organization had collected 400 pledge cards from community members that support an income based pass.  These are real people who would benefit from, and qualify for, an income based pass.  She encouraged the Board to continue thinking of ways that an income based pass can be done through the RTD budget.  She recognized Director Folska for her idea of setting aside marijuana taxes for an income based pass.  She acknowledged that RTD has a lot going on but she knows it can be done.

- Stephanie Noll shared that she works for Mi Casa Resource Center.  Mi Casa works with low income families who are trying to advance their educational opportunities and economic success.   Mi Casa offers a variety of training programs including job training, ESL, computer classes, etc.  She stated that last year Mi Casa served 1000s of people; however, despite participating in RTD’s nonprofit agency reduced fare program they were only able to distribute 12 passes and less than 50 tickets per month.  She expressed that Mi Casa supports the proposed changes to the program but believes more work needs to be done for affordability.  She asked RTD to make a 50% discount fare available to all low income residents.

- Mayra Gonzales, Community Organizer with Montbello, encouraged the Board to find a real solution to the fare crisis that has been created.  She thinks the nonprofit agency reduced fare program is a good start but does not go far enough.  She stated that it is cheaper for her to buy a car, gas and insurance as opposed to buying a bus pass.  She said she can only imagine how much more this will cost for entire families.  She expressed that without access to affordable fares families cannot get to school, work, doctors’ appointments, etc.

Mayra Gonzales shared that after speaking with the riders at a Park-n-Ride in Montbello it was clear that they were unaware of the proposed service changes that will negatively impact them and are still confused about the fare changes.  She stated that RTD is pricing Montbello out and cutting much needed service.  She asked RTD to refrain from making any service changes in the community until a six month impact study was conducted.

- Margaret Gomes, 9 to 5, has been working in this community for seven years.  She echoed what others had said that the nonprofit agency reduced fare program was not enough.  She stated that she was here this evening for the same reason she was last month and will be next month which is that the community needs affordable transportation and they will not leave until they get it.  She said that there are many people being forced to work for poverty level wages while are experiencing rampant displacement from places they have called home for generations.  She wants to make sure their lifeline, which is public transportation, is actually adequate for their needs.  She expressed that the community keeps hearing about affordability but they have not heard anything related to a timeline for an income based pass.  She stated that the community needs answers and they need them now.

- Candace Johnson, Jobs with Justice, said she also participates in the Affordable Fares Task Force.  She is glad to see an expansion of the nonprofit agency reduced fare program but it still will not be sufficient to accommodate a significant portion of the riders that need public transportation.  She stated that nonprofit agencies are already overburdened.  She believes that RTD should do all it can to provide a public good, which is the public good that RTD was meant to provide; RTD should do everything it can to accommodate and prioritize low income riders, not pass it off to nonprofit agencies.  RTD needs to continue to explore options for an income based pass.  She said the community is committed to working with RTD but are looking towards the Board’s leadership.  She stated that RTD needs to do better.

- Brittany Ott, Praxis, said she was here to ask the Board not to raise fares.  She is from a low income family and speaks on behalf of two homeless organizations.  The homeless need to be able to afford to get to classes and various support organizations.

- Karen Worminghaus, eGo CarShare, thanked RTD for listening to the feedback received from the Affordable Fares Task Force.  She thinks the administrative simplification for the nonprofit agency reduced fare program is a move in the right direction.  She said her message is to keep the momentum going.  She noted that there seems to be a lot of concern from the Board that RTD remain fiscally sustainable; however, the 18% increase for the program represents a nominal impact to RTD’s budget.  This is an opportunity for RTD to make a meaningful change in the lives of our neighbors who need the service most.  She suggests not putting a cap on the program but allowing staff to change it as needed and if there is funding available.  She asked RTD to continue to work on a more comprehensive low income pass program.

- Caitlyn Lowell, 9 to 5, stated that the need for a low income pass is urgent.  She shared that just last week she spoke with a single mother who had been priced out of her home from rent increases.  This woman had the opportunity for a higher paying job but had to turn it down due to the cost of transportation.  She urged that RTD consider an income based pass.

Chair Sisk thanked everyone for participating in the meeting.  He recognized the importance in providing the public with an opportunity to address the Board.

Director Folska shared that on October 3rd she took a group of Girl Scouts to Denver Union Station for a blindfolded tour in conjunction with WTS, an organization that mentors young girls interested in transportation.  She said this is a great tradition that was started three years ago with just 9 Girl Scouts.  This year there was a group of 45 with a waiting list.

Director Folska informed the Board that she recently took 30 of her constituents to the Elati Light Rail facility which was very well received.  She said her community really enjoyed meeting the staff.  She expressed that she cannot thank staff enough for their warm hospitality.  Director Folska believes tours like these really make it easier for people to understand everything that goes into providing Light Rail service.

Director Folska shared that she recently hosted a group from Kazakhstan who was very impressed with what RTD has done.

Chair Sisk said he cannot emphasize enough the time Directors spend outside of Board meetings.  He stated that if he does not mention something in his report it is not because it is not important but just because there are so many activities going on.

Director Anderson asked if this was the appropriate time for Directors to report on their activities.  Chair Sisk said he thinks New Business would be the proper time.

### A. January 2016 Service Plan

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the January 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $870,350 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

### B. Free Rides for Members of the Military

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal impact on RTD.

### C. Recommended Changes to the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that RTD staff be authorized to make changes to the RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program as detailed in Attachment A of this action to be implemented by January 1, 2016.

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to approve the recommended changes to the non-profit agency reduced fare program.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Anderson stated that she would be supporting the recommendation; however, she wanted it on the record that RTD’s mission is to provide transportation.  RTD does not do low income housing or a lot of other things.  She said that much of the public comment this evening had to do with social welfare issues.  She realizes there are some things that RTD can do but RTD cannot solve all of these problems.  She reiterated that she would be supporting this recommendation even though she thought very seriously about changing her vote because RTD cannot seem to give enough.  Everyone expects RTD to keep doing more.  She hopes that staff and the Affordable Fares Task Force come to the table with a plan that does not impact RTD’s service.

Director Hoy expressed that he shares some of Director Anderson’s concerns.  He said he can support most of this program but he does have a problem with the fiscal impact.  He stated that at the committee meeting staff clearly outlined that if these changes had been deployed in 2014 it would have resulted in $400K less in revenue.  That is $400K that RTD struggles with all the time.  He pointed out that RTD’s focus is to get people from A to B in a safe, efficient manner.  He noted that there was testimony this evening that bus passes are expensive and he agrees.  They are expensive because it costs a lot of money to run buses.  If RTD does not have income, RTD cannot run buses.  He commented that there were also requests to not eliminate service in certain areas.  Buses run on dollars.  Buses do not run because RTD gives discounts.  Director Hoy stated that he was sympathetic to people that do not make enough money.  He shared that in his family there have been individuals that needed help; however, he does not believe that RTD is a social agency.  RTD is responsible for transportation, not an individual household’s financial dilemma.  He said for all those reasons he will not be supporting the recommendation this evening.

Director Francone echoed Director Hoy’s comments.  She wondered, in the event that this recommendation does pass, who will monitor compliance with the elimination of the quarterly and annual reports and what the sanctions might be for non-compliance.  She said she cannot support this motion for many of the reasons expressed by Director Hoy.  She is not unsympathetic to low income struggles as she herself has been in that situation.  She expressed that the community’s pleas do not fall on deaf ears but RTD’s mission is to provide transportation and that costs money.  She noted that RTD already subsidizes a good portion of the cost of providing transportation.

Director Lubow said she felt the need to express a different point of view.  She thinks the audience and RTD’s riders need to know that there are a variety of views on the Board about providing affordable fares.  She feels more strongly than ever that RTD has a great responsibility to help the constituents be able to use RTD’s services.  She believes RTD should look at every place we can get money to do that.  She thinks that is a reasonable use of government money but recognized that is just her opinion.

Director Solano concurred with Director Lubow’s comments.  He believes it is important that RTD try to put everyone on the bus.  No one should be left out.  He wondered if people cannot get on the bus what are their options.  He stated that raising rates just makes congestion worse.

Director Tobiassen believes RTD needs to be fair to as many people as possible.  He noted that this particular program is for a small group of people who receive a discount similar to the discounts afforded to other pass programs.  He thinks if the Board was to look at the nuts and bolts the savings could be justified as it is for other programs.

Director Folska believes this is a public service for the public good.  She said that she will be supporting this because she believes that RTD can do well when RTD does good.

Chair Sisk noted that this was a recommendation he supported and continues to support, but in terms of being intimidated or threatened that will not go anywhere with him.  He said that people have the right to come and speak but it should be a matter of having a civil dialogue.  He believes that a lot more can get done when everyone works together.  He stated that he is a big supporter but he can easily be dissuaded by tactics.  He thinks that common ground can be found.  He shared that this is the first time he has been scolded for making a recommendation that people agreed with.  He said that does not sit well with him.

Director Archuleta reminded the Board that RTD is a public entity to serve the public.

Chair Sisk thanked everyone involved for making this possible.  He recognized that staff and a number of our constituents worked very hard to get RTD to this place.  He looks forward to continuing to work together and to use this as a springboard to move forward.

### D. Board Protocols for Community Engagement and Events

It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board of Directors adopt these guidelines for planning RTD public hearings, public meetings and special events to coordinate with RTD Board members’ schedules, and for informing Board members and senior leadership of relevant third-party meetings and events.

Motion to

Amend:               Director Lasater made the motion to amend the Board Protocols as it relates to RTD Board Member Speaking Events to indicate that if an event was held in a Director’s District they would be the primary designee, not the Chair of the Board.

“During some RTD events and meetings, it may be appropriate to include RTD Board members or staff in the speaking program.  RTD staff will engage Board members and staff as appropriate to participate in a meeting or special event program.  The Board member where an event or meeting will occur will be the designated participant on the Board’s behalf.  If an event is a global event than the Board Chair will determine which Director(s) speak.

If an event is planned by RTD and involves multiple Directors’ Districts, all such Directors should be informed of the event.  The Directors will be included as to any presentations or speeches with a shared responsibility at presentation.”

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Lasater believes that if an event is specific to a Director’s District than that Director should be the primary designate.  If it is a global event then the Board Chair should have priority.

Director Hoy stated he will vote no for the amendment.  He expressed concern that this is a last minute change that may not match with the rest of the protocols.  He said its intention is that this is something that should be addressed in the future.  Director Hoy indicated that he would also vote no for the action.  He does not think a Board meeting is where the details of something like this should be worked out.

Director Anderson said she would be voting against the amendment.  She believes Director Lubow did a good job with her recommended changes.  She stated that she does not think the protocols needed fixing yet.  She believes the Board should see how the protocols as initially recommended work first.
