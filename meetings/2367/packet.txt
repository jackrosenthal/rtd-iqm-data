Others Present:

2016 Requested Budget Workshop
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, reminded the Board
that the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan was approved in August, which is used as a
basis for the 2016 Requested Budget (Requested Budget). Staff also provided a high level
overview of the theme, assumptions and expenditures of the Requested Budget at the
September Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting. She said tonight she
would review the preliminary first draft of the Requested Budget. She reiterated that this
is a first draft that is subject to further revision, especially as the capital carry forward has
not yet been estimated as it is based on a September 30th close.
Jannette Scarpino indicated that the budget included Base System, FasTracks Project and
FasTracks Operations sources and uses as well as a reconciliation of net assets, reserves
and fund balances. She said the next step is to provide a presentation at the October 20th
Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting. Staff will present the final 2016
Recommended Budget at the November 10th Financial Administration and Audit Committee
meeting with a request for adoption of the 2016 Budget at the November 17th Board
Meeting.
Director Bagley expressed his appreciation for all the work that staff does in developing
the Requested Budget and SBP. He wondered if there is a specific area that staff worries
about in the budget that the Board should pay particular attention to. He conveyed his
concern about the sources of RTD funds and changes that could occur with lower gas
prices. Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, stated that staff feels comfortable with the
expenditures in the Requested Budget, especially now that the Diesel Rate Lock has been
established. She has two areas of concern which are farebox revenue and sales and use
tax. Staff used the projected farebox revenue figure that was approved as part of the
SBP. Heather Copp noted that farebox revenue is down this year and staff is unsure if this
trend will continue; however, staff does not have any additional information that indicate
those assumptions should be changed. On the sales and use tax side the actuals were
below budget for the first part of the year but have recovered in July. There is always a
concern that sales and use tax will be under what is budgeted but staff will continue to
monitor this through 2016 and advise the Board.
Director Hoy inquired if there were funds in the budget for adding new routes. Heather
Copp noted that Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, has been
advocating for that. There is money budgeted for service changes, which is 1% of the
operational budget. Bruce Abel explained that these funds would be for system

Director Francone asked if there was an increase in the budget from 2015 to 2016 and if
so, by how much. Heather Copp stated there was a difference of $345K but that does
not include the capital carry forward; however, the funding for these projects is already
budgeted but would flow through to 2016.
Director Menten asked if there was a process used to evaluate whether there can be cost
savings found in a department’s budget. Jannette Scarpino explained that as part of the
SBP each department is given a target budget that should not be exceeded and Finance
works closely with each department so the goals are met. Heather Copp commented that
departments underwent extra scrutiny this year since she was new. She sat in every
budget meeting and went through every department’s budget line by line. Director
Menten wondered if these meetings were productive. Heather Copp said she thought they
were. She noted that the departments were fairly realistic in their budget requests;
however, she believes there is room for improvement with the capital carry forward
projects.
Director Tobiassen wondered if there were projects that departments are requesting as
high priority but are being delayed due to budget. Jannette Scarpino explained that is one
way that staff balances the budget. She said she would send Director Tobiassen the
complete list of deferred projects that was included as part of the SBP approval. Director
Tobiassen thinks it is important for the Board to remember that there were many things
pushed off during the recessions that have created a backlog. Heather Copp agreed that
there was a backlog but staff has been working to address the needs through the SBP
process.
Chair Sisk asked if staff was satisfied that there was enough money in the budget for IT.
Heather Copp said that staff needed to do a thorough review of current projects, their
status, etc. She stated that there were some needs in the network area related to
redundancy and disaster recovery. Funding was included in the SBP and 2016 Requested
Budget but there will probably never be enough money to do everything staff would like to
do; however, she thinks we are in a good place for 2016.
Chair Sisk asked if there was any opportunity to refinance any of our bonds. Heather
Copp stated that the only one available for refinancing was the 2002A bonds. Staff is not

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 29, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

maintenance and adjustments, not for new routes. Heather Copp said any significant
changes would probably require additional funding and therefore come back to the Board
for approval. Director Hoy pointed out that there is a route in his District that will be
extended further North. He wondered if this was considered a new route or if this would
be considered a system adjustment. Heather Copp stated that would be considered a
system adjustment.

recommending a refinancing at this time because the savings will be minimal and RTD
would give up flexibility for a call provision in 2018-2020; however, staff continues to
monitor opportunities on a regular basis.

Director Folska expressed concern over departments being incentivized to use their full
budget one year so it does not get cut back the next. She wondered how staff addresses
this and creates incentives for departments to find cost efficiencies. Interim General
Manager Genova said that managers are evaluated on how they handle their budget.
Heather Copp explained that when a department comes in under budget it does not mean
the budget is automatically cut the next year. Instead there are discussions about what
caused the savings and if the funds might still be needed the next year.

III.

Fare Task Force Update - Low-Income Program
Tony McCaulay, Senior Manager of Marketing, reviewed a Power Point presentation with
the Board that is available in the September 29, 2015 Study Session Agenda Packet. The
presentation included background information about the current Nonprofit Agency Reduced
Fare Program as well as staff recommendations to simplify and streamline the program.
The current program sells the following fare media at the following discount:
 10-Ride ticketbooks (all types) – 60% discount
 Monthly passes (all types) – 25% discount
 Monthly passes (local regular only, limit 25/month) – 40% discount
He explained that the proposed change would provide a 50% discount for all fare media
(10-Ride ticketbooks, Day-pass coupon books and monthly passes). Additionally, the
proposed changes would streamline administration for the Non-profit agencies by reducing
the reporting requirements and frequency of reporting.
Director James wondered if staff had solicited the input of the nonprofit community, like
Mile High Connects, and how this program might work with a low income pass program.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, noted that this program is
separate from the Affordable Fares Task Force. He thinks this program will be different
from what comes out of the Affordable Fares Task Force. Director James inquired what
staff had budgeted for the revised program. Tony McCaulay said it would be about a $1.2
million increase. Scott Reed noted that it was difficult to judge demand which is why
staff is proposing a monthly cap on sales. Staff is suggesting a monthly cap so there is
not a scenario where a few agencies buy all the passes at the beginning of the year.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 29, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska noted that Jannette Scarpino said the budget would be posted on October
11. She wondered if that was typical. Jannette Scarpino explained that a notice is
published in the Denver Post and Boulder Daily camera stating that a copy of the budget is
available for review at the RTD Administrative Offices.

6.A

Director Walker inquired how much RTD will receive in fare revenue. Tony McCaulay
stated that RTD would receive $3.5 million for $7 million in fare revenue. Director Walker
wondered if agencies could purchase a month’s worth of stored value on a SmartCard.
Tony McCaulay said that would not be available at the beginning; it might be an option
down the road for monthly passes but SmartCards are too expensive to be issued as a
single ride or round trip ticket.
Director Francone inquired if the delivery would be at the expense of the nonprofit agency
as opposed to RTD. She wondered if there were any security concerns with allowing the
passes to be delivered. Tony McCaulay stated she was correct that the nonprofit agencies
would pay for the delivery. They also have the option of going to District Shops to pick
the tickets up. He explained that RTD uses FedEx for delivery because they require a
signature. FedEx is currently used to deliver tickets to a number of our sales outlets and
there have been no issues to date.
Director Francone asked staff to confirm that RTD will not be doing any kind of income
verification, credit checks, etc. Scott Reed stated that was correct; the current process
will remain in place which requires the nonprofit agency to do the means testing to
determine eligibility.
Director Francone expressed concern about arbitrarily increasing the cap for the program
from $6 million to $7 million. She said that she would be more amenable to leaving the
cap at $6 million to assess the demand.
Director Francone shared her concern that allowing nonprofit agencies to return unused
passes for credit creates another administrative task for RTD. She thinks the nonprofit
agencies would be more judicious and realistic in their purchases if they could not return
them for credit. Tony McCaulay said that returning the passes had been discussed with
the departments that would administer the credits and there was not a concern about the
added work.
Director Tobiassen expressed his appreciation for the simplification. He noted that
requiring the nonprofit agencies to submit logs seemed to be the accountability mechanism

Packet Pg. 9

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 29, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow thanked the staff for their work. She thinks the streamlining seems very
effective. She expressed that while this proposal is great it is still incredibly important to
keep working on a low income pass program. She asked as to the timeline for a low
income pass. Scott Reed pointed out that there would be some overlap between the
Nonprofit Program and a low income pass program. He said that currently the Affordable
Fare Task Force is looking to find funding partners as everyone recognizes that it is
difficult to get a sustained level of finding for this type of program.

6.A

Director James wondered how the fare revenue RTD receives under the new program is
different than the program today. Scott Reed stated that staff is anticipating about $200K
more in revenue.
Director Hoy asked if staff could apply the new discount to the sales from last year to
compare the revenue. He wondered if RTD would have received more or less money with
the exact same sales under the new program. Director Hoy inquired what the proposed
cap would be. Tony McCaulay explained that there would be a cap of about $575K per
month.
Director Hoy asked if the qualification was still based on WIC. He wondered if staff had
considered that there might be people paying full fares who would now take advantage of
the reduced fare. Scott Reed said that WIC was still used to determine eligibility. He
reiterated that people must qualify in order to get the reduced fares. The new program
does not change the number of people who would qualify.
Director Menten appreciates that the program is becoming more streamlined but expressed
concern about the discount for ticket books going from 60% to 50%. She commented
that if someone is low income affording a monthly pass is harder than a ticket book. She
asked previously how many people bought monthly passes versus the ticketbooks. Tony
McCaulay stated that in the existing program $3.2 million was spent on monthly passes at
$2.6 million was for the ticketbooks. He said that there has been concern from several
agencies about the ticketbooks but hopes that being able to recoup some of the cost from
their clients might offset the increase.
Director Menten pointed out that previously there was a period of time in which expired
ticketbooks could be exchanged. She wondered if the opportunity to receive a credit
eliminated being able to exchange the tickets. Tony McCaulay explained that the credit
was only for monthly passes; tickets would still be exchanged as they are today.

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 29, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

to make sure tickets were getting to the right people. He wonders how RTD will ensure
that is still happening. He said he is concerned about the liability of RTD if an agency was
not getting the tickets out correctly. Tony McCaulay explained that there will be an
annual certification of compliance to be signed by the CEO of the nonprofit agency as well
as periodic audits by RTD staff of organizations’ recordkeeping and processes. Director
Tobiassen asked if additional staff is needed for the audits. Tony McCaulay stated that no
additional staff would be needed. Director Tobiassen suggested that periodic updates
would be beneficial for the Board.

IV.

Overview of Smart Card Pilot 2

Director Francone recognized that there may be concern about expanding the pilot to the
public but also worries that RTD employees have more familiarity with the system. She
wonders if there is a way to include the general public. Tony McCaulay noted that the
SmardCards have been tested with our customer panel. Bruce Abel, Assistant General
Manager of Bus Operations, explained that this pilot involves money. By using employees
the cards can be loaded with “Monopoly Money” in case something does not function
properly. Director Francone commented that since the general public does not get training
she would rather do the pilot cold to see if she could figure the system out.
Director Hoy shared that he spoke with an employee who participated in the first pilot.
This employee said that things have really improved throughout the pilot process. He
thanked staff for their hard work.
Director Menten asked what kinds of problems were identified in the first pilot. Georgann
Van Gemert explained that staff is currently compiling that information to report back to
the Board; however, she noted that the back end systems, such as if a person took a local
versus regional trip or if they transferred, were working perfectly.

V.

Other Matters
Scott Reed shared that the Annual Report to the Region was now available on the
website. He passed out a hardcopy to each Board member.
Director Lubow asked if the General Manager Executive Search Committee (GMESC) had
made any decisions about other Board members being able to submit interview questions.
Chair Sisk said that the Committee has decided there will be a subcommittee of two
GMESC members who will compile the questions. When the process begins other
Directors can submit their questions to the subcommittee.
Director Francone recognized Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Light Rail, and
his team for the wonderful tour they did of the Elati facility for Boy Scout Troup 554. She
said the boys were so excited to use the simulator and could not stop talking about it.
She shared that the parents who accompanied the Boy Scouts were also very impressed.
She said the tour was very much appreciated and thanked staff for their time.

Georgann Van Gemert, Marketing Account Executive, informed the Board that the second
SmartCard pilot program will take place from October 12 to November 13 to test various
components such as card functionality, hardware, retail pointe of sales units, etc. All of
the information gained from the pilot will be used to improve the process and develop the
marketing communications plan. She invited the any Board members who wished to
participate to let the Board Office know.

6.A

Chair Sisk indicated that the Telephone Town Halls had begun. He and Director Anderson
each had one on Monday evening. He said his was a very good experience.
Director Deadwyler recognized those who attended the Central Park Station grand
opening. She thought it was a very good event and people were very excited to see the
station and artwork. She thanked Directors James, Solano and Tobiassen for attending.

B. Citizens Advisory Committee Update
Bob Rizzuto from the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) informed the Directors
that the committee has been active discussing how the CAC could become better
engaged as FasTracks winds down. Discussions have been held within the
committee, with RTD staff and with RTD Directors. The committee expects to
have a draft recommendation by the end of next week. The draft will include a list
of ideas, suggestions, and items for discussion.
Bob Rizzuto noted that the last CAC meeting was held at the Westminster City
Council chambers and it was well attended. RTD staff made two presentations:
one on the Flatiron Flyer and one on the Northwest commuter line. He thanked
staff for the great presentations.
Citizens for Finishing FasTracks, a group based out of Longmont, also made a
presentation during the CAC meeting. Bob Rizzuto said that their presentation led
to a very good discussion in which some questions were answered and good
suggestions were presented. He added that Dave Downing, Westminster City
Engineer, and Director Hoy also were in attendance.
Committee Chair Hoy noted that it sounded like the CAC has been very busy. He
thought the meeting in Westminster went really well.
Director Solano wondered if there have been any discussions within the CAC about
the Northeast Area Transit Evaluation (NATE) and the transit connection between
Commerce City and Brighton. Bob Rizzuto replied that the NATE is not a current
topic of discussion but that does not mean that it will not be discussed in the
future.

been very committed and dedicated. He thanked the Directors for their support.
Committee Chair Hoy thanked Bob Rizzuto for the report and the CAC for all their
work.

C. Recommended Actions
D. Updates

• I-225 Rail Line Project Update
Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
introduced Chuck Culig, I-225 Engineering Project Manager. He presented
the I-225 Rail Line Project Update as included in the FasTracks Monitoring
Committee agenda packet for October 13, 2015. The presentation included
rail line progress, upcoming construction, public information update, time
lapse video of the Florida Station Pedestrian Bridge, the Alameda-Sable
intersection closure and pedestrian access, and picture updates of the
construction.
Adrina Gibson, Manager for the Small Business Office (SBO), presented an
update on the line’s Small Business Enterprise (SBE) program. She
highlighted that Kiewit’s SBE participation goal is 25%; however, the SBE
commitment to date is 30%.
Director Tobiassen noted that the closure of the Alameda-Sable intersection
has been huge for the community. He congratulated the residents for being
informed and avoiding major traffic issues. He thanked the Public
Information (PI) team and City of Aurora Public Relations for keeping the
public informed of changes. He said that the team working on the I-225 line
is great. He looks forward to all the projects wrapping up.
Director Folska thanked Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, and Lisa
Trujillo, I-225 PI Project Manager, for their participation in the Town Hall for
District E. She added that many constituents have emailed her to express
their appreciation for the Town Hall.
Director Folska informed the Directors that she participated in a tour of the

Director Folska asked staff to talk about the new safety campaign. Lisa
Trujillo said that the campaign will kick off at the end of October. She does
not want to divulge too much information as the Marketing Department will
make a presentation during the October 20, 2015 Operations and Customer
Service Committee meeting; however, she mentioned that the campaign will
raise awareness of safety at rail crossings and the entire RTD system.
Henry Stopplecamp added that his children had looked at the campaign on
their mobile devices and enjoyed it.
Director Folska mentioned that during the Town Hall for District F, Director
Tobiassen encouraged the community to go out of their way and patronize
the businesses affected by the closure of the Alameda-Sable intersection.
She said that this was rightly said as this time of the year is one of the
busiest times for all businesses.
Director Folska thanked Matt Druffle, Office Engineer at Jacobs, for creating
the commemorative puzzle pieces for the I-225 Rail celebration.
Director Deadwyler said that she has been watching the project for the last
couple of years. She noted that for a while it looked like there was not a lot
going on. She was glad to hear during the presentation that the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT) is also doing construction as she
thought that the closure at Colfax in downtown Aurora was part of RTD’s
projects.
Director Deadwyler wondered when staff expected the Alameda-Sable
intersection to reopen. She noted that for her accessing the area has been
really difficult. Chuck Culig replied that staff is aiming for the second week
of November and hopes to reopen the intersection by Thanksgiving.
Director Deadwyler tells her constituents that everything will be beautiful
once completed. She added that it is great to have the Thanksgiving
timeline.
Chair Sisk noted that he is very impressed with all the work on the I-225 rail
line. He complemented staff for their work. He pointed out that Kiewit’s
SBE commitment is phenomenal and shows what we can do by virtue of
infusing money into a sector. He congratulated Lisa Trujillo for keeping the
community informed.
Chair Sisk asked staff for a firm date on the reopening of the Alameda-Sable
intersection. He noted that saying “Thanksgiving” is too loose. Chuck Culig

Work Initiative Now (WIN) program and that Rail Operations looks to hire
more. Director Folska encouraged staff to continue the partnership between
the WIN program and local colleges.

6.B

Director Bagley wondered what the specific date for the opening of the R
line is. Chuck Culig replied that the specific date has not been determined
but will be brought to the Board as soon as it becomes available. Director
Bagley asked what the travel time will be from the Nine Mile Station to the
Peoria Station. Chuck Culig replied that the estimated travel time from the
Lincoln station to the Peoria station is one hour. He noted that staff is still
coordinating with the City of Aurora regarding stop signals and other
matters. Director Bagley pointed out that assuming receipt of the Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Southeast rail line; the R line would
start at the Ridgegate Station, 2.5 miles south of the Lincoln Station. He
added that it will be important to start understanding the travel time from
the Ridgegate Station to the Airport as the AT bus route will still be
operational after the R line opens.
Committee Chair Hoy said that he appreciates all the work by staff. He
pointed out that people can see the progress in the area.

E. Other Matters
Director Bagley mentioned that 8 Directors attended the APTA Annual Meeting in
San Francisco, CA: Directors Anderson, Archuleta, Francone, Hoy, Sisk, Solano,
Walker, and himself. He noted that it was a very successful convention from a
number of perspectives. He attended a session that provided great information on
Transit Oriented Development. Director Bagley asked Dave Genova, Interim
General Manager, about the award the Southeast line received. Dave Genova
explained that Susan Wood, Manager for Environmental Planning, accepted the
2015 Outstanding Achievement Award for Excellence in Environmental
Documentation Preparation on behalf of RTD. Director Bagley added that RTD’s
Marketing Department received 5 Ad Wheel awards during the conference. He
noted that staff is to be congratulated on their efforts.

C. Updates

• Sustainability Program
Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
introduced Ignacio Correa-Ortiz, Senior Architect and Urban Designer, and
Garrett Christnacht, Senior Architect, who reviewed a Power Point
presentation with the Board that is available in the October 13, 2015
Planning and Development Committee Meeting Agenda Packet.
Ignacio Correa-Ortiz explained that the Sustainability Policy was established
through a Board Resolution that was passed in 2006 with a goal of
incorporating sustainability in all RTD activities. The Sustainability
Committee was formed to provide input and suggestions in meeting that
goal. He noted the following indicators show that the Sustainability Program
is doing quite well:
 Environmental Footprint
o Greenhouse Gases Emitted
o Energy Consumption
o Water Usage
 Service Footprint
o Bus Passenger-Miles Traveled
o Light Rail Passenger-Miles Traveled

Director Solano left before the beginning of the Planning and Development Committee
Meeting. Director Lasater was absent.

Garrett Christnacht shared that there have been accomplishments in
sustainability across the entire organization including bus operations, rail
operations, Eagle P3, West Line, East Metro, US 36 Bus Rapid Transit, and
Denver Union Station. There have also been accomplishments made in
energy use reduction and recycling. He believes it will be important moving
forward to update the RTD Sustainability policy and guidelines, establish a
green procurement policy, monitor sustainability metrics to evaluate the
program, measure walkability within our community and develop
sustainability standards for landscape, recycling, lighting, etc.
Director Folska stated that she was very impressed with the presentation.
She thought it was loaded with great information that is exactly the type of
information that Communications should be leveraging.
Director Folska asked for further information regarding RTD’s water usage.
Ignacio Correa-Ortiz said that Safety, Security and Facilities and Rail
Operations monitor RTD’s water consumption. Sustainability measures,
such as rain sensors, have led to a reduction in water consumption by RTD.
Director Folska shared that she recently toured the Elati Light Rail Facility
and learned that they recycle 90% of the water used, which is very
impressive.
Director Folska noted that the idea of walkability was very important to her.
She pointed out that Downtown Denver is considered to be very walkable;
however, from her perspective walking Downtown is becoming more
challenging due to intersection crossings. She believes it is more important
than ever to have audible signals at every crossing Downtown. She asked
staff to speak with the City of Denver about this. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz said
that the Sustainability Committee would begin the conversation but he
thinks the leadership of the Board is more effective in contributing to those
conversations. Director Folska expressed that she would love to be involved
in the conversations.
Director Menten noted there were several Park-n-Rides that had been
configured for solar panels and charging of electric vehicles but it was noted
that RTD would not receive any revenue from this. She wondered what the
capital cost was in adding this to the Park-n-Rides. Henry Stopplecamp
explained that the only cost was to run conduit to the boxes for the solar
panels and charging stations, which were otherwise left empty. Since the
Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 13, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

He said that the Sustainability Committee came up with a Service
Effectiveness standard as a measure for how RTD is doing in terms of our
Service Footprint, which was to take the number of boardings divided by the
vehicle revenue miles. He stated that this is not necessarily the same as
cost effectiveness of our service.

6.C

conduits needed to be run anyway the cost was very minor. Garrett
Christnacht pointed out that to add this later would be far more expensive
then when a Park-n-Ride was under construction.

Director Lubow expressed her delight at the wonderful work being done by
the Sustainability Committee. She shared that she has a background at the
Environmental Protection Agency and is very supportive of sustainability.
Director Lubow wondered if the Sustainability Committee had determined
the savings to RTD for the various efficiency measures. She thinks that
figure would have some real value. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz stated that it was
not something the Committee had done to-date but would begin an analysis.
Director Lubow commented that while she appreciated looking at the trends
for various efficiencies she also felt like it was presented in a vacuum. She
thought it would be helpful to also include how RTD compares to other
transit agencies. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz explained that the Sustainability
Committee did look at and work with other agencies but it is not necessarily
easy to compare from one to the other. Director Lubow believes there are
some things that must be comparable and hopes to see more information
about this in the future. She thanked the Committee for all of their work.
Director Francone asked for a copy of the Sustainability Policy and
Guidelines. Garrett Christnacht noted that the information is available on the
website in an accessible format. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz said that staff would
send the link to the Directors.
Director Francone asked for a further explanation of the meaning of Service
Effectiveness. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz explained that this was the metric the
Sustainability Committee decided to use in terms of determining
performance of bus and light rail service overall. The figure is determined by
taking the number of boardings divided by the number of vehicle revenue
miles traveled throughout the year. Director Francone believes a metric
related to savings would be a helpful way for the Board to understand the
work of the Sustainability Committee and how it is saving RTD money. She
thinks this is something the constituents would be very interested to hear as
well.

Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 13, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked staff to have a discussion about the cleanup of the
brownfields that was done along the East Line offline; specifically she is
interested in the high and low value of the cost per acre for cleanup.
Director Menten also inquired how RTD recycles oil. She wondered if we
were able to sell it. Interim General Manager Genova said that it is picked
up by a recycler but he would need to confirm if RTD sold it. He noted there
have been various contracts over the years depending on the market.

6.C

Chair Sisk asked if natural gas vehicles were something that the
Sustainability Committee had considered. He shared that he has been
receiving feedback that RTD is behind the times using diesel vehicles. Bruce
Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, explained that during
the most recent bus procurement staff did an analysis of Compressed
Natural Gas (CNG) versus clean diesel vehicles. He noted that while there
would be operational savings using CNG the capital costs far outweigh those
savings. Additionally, since we are purchasing clean diesel vehicles the
emissions are very comparable. Chair Sisk indicated that RTD needed to get
better about getting the message out about our clean diesel vehicle
emissions.

• Transit Oriented Development Assessment
Bill Sirois, Transit Oriented Communities Senior Manager, noted that this is
the third presentation from the Transit Oriented Development (TOD)
Consultants. He reminded the Board that the team is comprised of GB
Arrington of GB Place Making, Lorna Morita of TRA, and Arleen Taniwaki of
ArLand. They reviewed a Power Point presentation that is available in the
October 13, 2015 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.
The presentation focused on an overview of material covered in past
briefings, Board interviews, key recommendations, a short-term action
agenda, and creating a proactive TOD pipeline.
GB Arrington noted that the six themes for this presentation were:
 RTD is on track with TOD
 There is more to do to be ready for 2016
 RTD needs to strengthen tools and decisions making for the TOD
department
 RTD needs an updated TOD Strategic Plan
 RTD needs to move to a proactive TOD pipeline

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 13, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair James noted that on the Service Effectiveness trend line
the performance dropped between 2012 and 2013. He wondered if this
was because the capacity of the light rail fleet was increased by a large
amount in that timeframe with the opening of the West Line. He expects
that while there is not an immediate increase in ridership the service
effectiveness would increase in the future. Ignacio Correa-Ortiz stated that
was correct. Committee Chair James encouraged the Sustainability
Committee to try to compare the Service Effectiveness standard to other
agencies. He thinks it would be an interesting comparison. Ignacio CorreaOrtiz said that the Sustainability Committee would continue to investigate
such a comparison.

6.C

GB Arrington reviewed the Short Term Action Agenda they created to help
address some of the recommendations and findings. He said that the RTD
Board needs to provide clear policy direction on TOD and how it should be
considered in making agency decisions. He believes it is very important that
the TOD Strategic Plan be updated; at a minimum the mission, parking,
consolidated functions and communications need to be evaluated. GB
Arrington stated that RTD should also:
 Strengthen internal TOD decision-making and transparency
 Adopt an unsolicited proposals policy
 Create an internal TOD Swat Team
 Establish TOD group as the point of contact for TOD
 Act as an ombudsman for development partners
GB Arrington explained that it is also very important for RTD to be ready for
2016. The TOD toolbox needs to be complemented and augmented to
include access to appraisals, real estate expertise and real estate legal
counsel as well as sufficient permanent staffing. He commented that a
digital real estate inventory system would also be beneficial. There should
also be a clear framework for a TOD portfolio analysis to determine and
assess promising stations. GB Arrington thinks it is important that the TOD
Pilot Lessons Learned report is completed.
Committee Chair James thanked the TOD Consultants for the
comprehensive report. He commended them for acknowledging the good
things that staff and the Board have done in the TOD arena as it is ever
evolving. He asked if the staff had any comments before he opened it up to
the Board.
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, reminded the Board
that this is an outside assessment that reflects back what the Consultants
heard from internal and external parties as well as the Consultants
recommendations. He explained that some of the action items are ones that
can be acted upon by staff while some are policy level decisions that will
require Board action.
Interim General Manager Genova said he appreciates the comment that RTD
compares well with national best practices. He noted that Denver Union

Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 13, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

GB Arrington outlined for major recommendations that the consultants were
suggesting the Board and staff consider as:
 Elevating TOD within RTD
 Complementing and augmenting RTD’s TOD Tool Box
 Strengthening internal processes for developing and managing TOD
 Updating the TOD strategy and resolving some key issues

6.C

Station is the national model for TOD. He thinks the TOD staff is
empowered but often have to come back to have multi-department
meetings. He believes that RTD already has a lot of tools and documents
used for design criteria. Interim General Manager Genova thinks that RTD
needs to formalize some of the things we already do.

Committee Chair James shared that one of the things he has learned in
working outside RTD is that you have to be patient. Real estate markets
evolve very slowly. He said it is very easy to have expectations that are
greater than the reality.
Director Bagley pointed out that time kills real estate deals. He believes
anything that can be done to facilitate TOD projects not taking vast amounts
of extra time is critical. He expressed his excitement at receiving the
Consultants’ report and recommendations. He recognized how hard the
TOD team works. He said he was happy to hear that staff planned to work
on the short term action agenda. Director Bagley noted that there are five
new corridors opening in 2016. He hopes that RTD will be proactive and
challenged staff to be more aggressive. He stated that Denver Union Station
is a great example of what can be done. Director Bagley thinks that TOD
should be a primary focus, not tertiary. He expressed concern over the
issues between TOD and Real Property.
Director Lubow said she was very excited about the study. She believes
this is a very special time in Denver with the construction of FasTracks and
RTD could change the face of the Denver metro area. She agrees with
Director Bagley that TOD is very important and now is the time to act. She
thanked the consultants and staff for the candor of the report. She asked
that staff keep the Board updated as to the progress of implementing the
recommendations. Director Lubow wondered how one elevates TOD. She
thinks it is a nice phrase but is not sure how that is done. Director Lubow
also expressed concern about being ombudsmen for developers. She does
not think of them as shrinking violets that need a lot of help. Director
Lubow said that RTD needs to be careful about not being too supportive.
Committee Chair James believes one way of elevating TOD is to create the
TOD Swat Team. He asked staff to prepare a plan for the Board outlining
how to accomplish each recommendation or if a recommendation might not
be feasible.
Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 13, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair James asked the Consultants to explain how the TOD
Swat Team differs from the TOD staff. GB Arrington explained that the
TOD Swat Seam needs to involve all the different groups at RTD at the start
of a TOD. This allows the full agency to identify any issues and work
through them collaboratively.

6.C

Director Walker wondered if the station area plans made by various cities
were helpful. Bill Sirois acknowledged that there are over 50 station area
plans. He said that some have higher expectations than they should, which
creates challenges. He believes it will be important to evaluate those station
area plans to determine what ones are most viable and perhaps nudge them
forward. GB Arrington explained that station area plans are helpful to
indicate who your neighbors will be but do not address RTD’s land; so RTD
needs to use those plans to determine how to be the partner with what is
planned to be around RTD’s property.
Director Francone said she found the report very helpful. She appreciated
that it outlined the good parts of RTD’s TOD as well as showing where there
is room for improvement, which she knows staff will take to heart. She
asked if the Consultants could give examples of the types of decisions the
TOD team should be empowered to make. GB Arrington said that TOD at
RTD involves many different departments. He explained that with the swat
team decisions should be vetted internally so that there is one answer;
however, that does not happen today. He stated that there are multiple
answers with multiple people speaking. He recognized that RTD has
established itself as a leader in building things but not as a partner with the
development community. He noted that there are some question marks
surrounding RTD and those need to be removed so they developer
understands the implications of working with RTD.
Director Francone wondered how GB Arrington would measure success for
RTD. He believes that success means RTD has a clear and transparent
decision making process with well-defined rules of engagement. He hopes
that RTD will move from being reactive to proactive. He said that in the full
report this would be outlined in much more detail that the Directors would
be getting soon.
Director Francone commented that to her RTD’s mission is transportation
and not necessarily land development or low income housing; however, RTD
is tasked with being good stewards of the real estate and properties that
RTD does own. She expressed concern that there is not documentation of
the land holdings that can be leveraged. Director Francone said her goal is
Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 13, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Walker asked if any of the tools recommended by the Consultants
were included in next year’s budget. He thinks it would be a shame to put
all this work in a high profile area but not fund it. Bill Sirois said that
obviously he would like more funding just like every department but that
TOD is getting resources. He said that the process had been started to hire
an additional person. The team would use this report to determine what
resources are the most important.

to leverage RTD’s land in a profitable way. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
said she wanted to provide some examples of conflicts that have come up
that needed to be resolved. She shared that there was a piece of property
that RTD owned next to one of our light rail maintenance facilities that staff
wanted to use to expand operations; however, there was tremendous
pressure from the municipalities that wanted RTD to give up the land for
development. She shared that Denver Union Station was another project
that had conflict. Initially Bus Operations was getting tremendous pressure
from the City of Denver to not layover buses on the City streets. She
explained that plans were made to widen the facility to layover buses
underground; however, this would have given up land for development that
was paying for the development. She noted that the conflicts between
operations and developers are very real and getting them on the table right
away is critical.
Committee Chair James agreed that conflicts do arise. He said the TOD
report from the Consultants encouragement to minimize conflicts by
leveraging the resources RTD has.
Director Folska thinks that perhaps TOD should be its own department
within RTD but then a business case would need to be made that it was a
sustainable department. She said she is very interested in the inventory of
RTD’s real estate assets along with the opportunities for each of those
assets. She believes it is important to be able to show what makes a
successful TOD.
Director Bagley pointed out that everyone wants to have first and last mile
connectivity around stations as well as better pedestrian activity. He stated
that requires RTD to work with our partners. He commented that without
Denver Union Station as RTD’s transit hub the FasTracks project would not
be functional, so the compromises made there were very important. He said
that Boulder Junction is another example of a TOD that RTD has been
involved with. He shared that there is a ULI forum he will be attending on
Boulder Junction. He reiterated that it is not just moving people from A to B
but working with the community to make the TOD functional.
Director Bagley suggested creating something similar to the Fiscal
Sustainability Task Force where RTD involves people from the development
community, municipalities, etc. He believes acting as an ombudsman is very
important as there needs to be someone who can cut through the tape and
help the developers navigate the bureaucratic maze of the government.
Director Bagley does not believe the TOD division needs to make money as
that is not the purpose of TOD.

C. Updates

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, notified the Directors that
Roger Sherman from CRL Associates was not able to attend the meeting.
She reviewed the Local Government Relations update as included in the
October 13, 2015 Government Relations Committee agenda packet.
Sherry Ellebracht noted that she attended the Metro Mayors Caucus meeting
on October 7th. The Caucus discussed the Scientific and Cultural Facilities
District (SCFD) reauthorization. She shared that it was quite a discussion
with more information to come as the subject develops.
Sherry Ellebracht informed the Directors that the ballots for the November
3rd elections will be mailed out on October 14th. She added that after the
elections Roger Sherman will work with staff to schedule time for the
Directors to meet with the newly elected officers.
She pointed out that the Tampa Chamber of Commerce visited Denver and
met with many different groups. Their time with RTD was spent on Transit
Oriented Development and FasTracks. Roger Sherman, along with Kim
Kucera, Senior Vice President of CRL Associates, and Bill Sirois, Senior
Manager for Transit Oriented Communities, participated in the tour and
presentation. Sherry Ellebracht added that the delegation was very

interested in finding out how RTD was able to get FasTracks on the ballot in
2004 and the collaboration that has followed. Bill Sirois and Roger Sherman
emphasized to the delegation that this project has taken time.
Sherry Ellebracht added that Maria Garcia-Berry, CRL Associates Chief
Executive Officer, presented on FasTracks at the Transportation for America
Innovation Academy.

Jenifer Brandeberry of Brandeberry~McKenna noted that her firm helped
organize a tour of the University of Colorado A Line for the Office of Legal
Legislative Services. She said it is great that Capitol staff has reached out
to be educated and knowledgeable in RTD matters and the impact that the
agency is having on the region.
She added that the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) met
a week ago and will meet again on November 2nd. Brandeberry~McKenna
will present the bill drafts to the directors once the TLRC finalizes them.
Jenifer Brandeberry announced January 28th, 2016 from 5:00 – 7:00 p.m.
as the date for the Legislative Forum/Educational Session for the General
Assembly that Committee Chair Folska and Chair Sisk have been
coordinating. The tentative location is the Gallery at Denver Union Station.
She mentioned that the budget situation of the State will dominate the 120
day Congressional session. The conversations will determine what, if any,
money is available for additional transportation funding at the State level.
Governor Hickenlooper is set to present his budget during the first half of
November to the Joint Budget Committee.
Director Lubow wondered if some transportation funds were supposed to be
distributed due to a legal requirement from last year. Jenifer Brandeberry
explained that SB 228 came into play for the first time based on the
economic recovery; however, there is a formula on how the money is spent.
The formula is affected by TABOR, K-12 funding, Gallagher Amendment,
and the Hospital Fee, among others. She added that the Joint Budget
Committee creates the budget forecast based on conservative projections
yet the final budget numbers are not available until March. Jenifer
Brandeberry said that she would create a one page document explaining how
the formula works. Director Lubow noted that it was truly outstanding to
listen to the complexity of the process and was not quite sure that a one
page document would explain the complexity. Marla Lien, General Counsel,
informed the Directors that Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, will create
the document Jenifer Brandeberry alluded to since she used to be the
Deputy Executive Director for the Colorado Department of Revenue.

• State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs

6.D

Committee Chair Folska asked Jenifer Brandeberry to confirm that the
Constitution of the State of Colorado is quite extensive. Jenifer Brandeberry
agreed that it is one of the largest in the nation.
Director Francone asked Jenifer Brandeberry to confirm that Propositions AA
and BB on the ballot for November will not affect RTD. Jenifer Brandeberry
confirmed that those two propositions if passed will not have an effect on
funding for RTD.

Committee Chair Folska noted that she enjoyed working with Director
Francone and Mike Dino, Principal from Squire Patton Boggs, on the Federal
Staff Forum held on August 26th at Denver Union Station. She added that
moving forward it is important to keep providing these kinds of opportunities
at the State level in order for the Directors to have face to face time to build
relationships and keep contributing to the cooperative bipartisan coalition.
She pointed that this coalition is not easy but it is simple.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, noted the historic significance of seeing the
House of Representatives in a leadership quandary since The Hon. John
Boehner announced his resignation as the Speaker of the House. He noted
that the Republicans are hoping The Hon. Paul Ryan would be the next
Speaker.
He pointed out that House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
Chairman Bill Shuster still intends to present a bi-partisan bill in committee
before the October 29th expiration of the current 3 month extension for the
Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Mike Dino added that the $8 billion cash
infusion to the HTF in July will sustain it until July 2016.
Mike Dino said that the White House and Congress are setting final budget
resolutions in order to pass the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget.
He ended his remarks congratulating RTD for winning one of two nationwide
Federal Transit Administration’s 2015 Outstanding Achievement Award of
Excellence in Environmental Documentation Preparation for the Southeast
Rail Extension.
Director Lubow said she had heard that the Senate approved some kind of
change to the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) definition but the House of
Representatives has not. She asked Mike Dino to expand on this. Mike
Dino replied that the changes made were reported a few months back to the

Director Francone added that she would find the one page document

Board and that he could review the report with the Directors again. The
changes are not what RTD requested as the corridor still has to be
dedicated. Director Lubow wondered if the House was amenable to the
changes RTD is pursuing. Mike Dino said that Squire Patton Boggs is
working on that.

Director Francone mentioned that conversations with staffers for both The
Hon. Ken Buck and The Hon. Cory Gardner pointed to agreements with
RTD’s definition of BRT. She added that she will personally invite the
staffers to the January 28th Legislative Forum. Director Folska stressed the
importance of all Board members attending this Legislative Forum.

D. Other Matters
Marla Lien, General Counsel, informed the Board that to her understanding they
would be safe not showing up tomorrow to the City and County of Denver (Denver)
court. She is working on gathering better information through RTD Security staff’s
personal contacts with Denver’s District Attorney Office. Director Francone noted
that she will be attending.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Committee Update
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager for Civil Rights, informed the Directors that the
update will focus on the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) office. She
introduced James Cook, Manager for EEO, who reviewed the EEO
presentation as included in the Civil Rights Committee agenda packet for
October 20, 2015. The presentation included highlights, trainings and
outreach which include a video training, and the office’s three year plan.
Director Tobiassen asked staff how many complaints the EEO office receives
on an annual basis. James Cook replied that the number varies and it is
reported to the Senior Leadership Team and the General Manager. He added
that there have been fewer complaints this year due in part to outreach to
management in identifying and dealing with issues.
Director Francone expressed her interest in watching the training video.
James Cook replied that the video will be made available as soon as it is
finalized. The final details include closed captioning and logistics on
employees acknowledging completion of the training.

6.E

Director Deadwyler said that most video trainings have a question and
answer section at the end. She wondered if this video would be similar.
James Cook stated yes but those are the details staff is still finalizing.
Director Deadwyler asked what would happen if the participants get the
questions wrong. James Cook answered that staff is still working on the
logistics and is hoping to have the video training running by the first of the
year. So far the plan is that an employee will not get credit for the class if
they do no pass the test. Zamy Silva added that the hope is that the
training will be done annually to ensure that everyone understands EEO and
how to apply it in the work place.
Director Menten wondered as to the length of the video. James Cook
replied that the video for management would be 90 minutes and the one for
frontline employees will be 45 to 60 minutes.
Committee Chair Walker said that he has done similar video trainings at
different jobs. If the participants do not answer the questions correctly they
would have to take the test again. He noted that the number of complaints
has dropped because of training management on how to identify and handle
situations.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley reported to the Directors on his attendance at the 2015 APTA
Annual Meeting. He said that his purpose in attending this conference was to learn
more about transit from the General Sessions. He met with some of RTD’s suppliers
and other people in the industry. He added that as RTD gets more involved in
Transit Oriented Development and Transit Oriented Communities (TOD/TOC), it is
important for the Directors to attend conferences such as the ones held by APTA
and Rail~Volution.
He added that the breakout sessions he attended included topics such as how to
reduce new development impacts on transportation networks, planning transit for
TOC, transit and land use decision making, and Bus Rapid Transit operations. One
particularly interesting discussion centered on integrated mobility and
transformative technology, creating a greater rider experience, using the cloud to
connect mobility options for customers, providing Wi-Fi, enhancing choices for
Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 20, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska expressed that she would be interested in historical data
regarding EEO complaints in the form of a chart or something similar. She
also expressed her interest in the video as well as participating in the
training. Zamy Silva said that a report could be put together while keeping
in mind that there is a lot of information that cannot be shared. She added
that the video will be made available to the Directors as soon as it is
finalized, which will be ADA and Title VI compliant.

6.E

He highlighted a presentation by Nadine Lee, Engineer Project Manager for US-36
and Northwest Rail Line, on Collaborative Mobility Projects, a project she has been
working on as part of the Leadership APTA Program. Another presentation he
highlighted was Ken Gronbach’s Charting the Course through Demographic Change.
Ken Gronbach noted in his presentation that we are in a sweet spot for public
transportation due to Millennials wanting to forego cars and Boomers with more
time for special events. Other topics discussed included demographics and public
transportation, the effects of sociographics on transit demand, Millennials and
mobility in the Southwest, trends in rider demographics and preferences, gaining
insight into ridership, and redefining public transit benefits for future generations.
Director Bagley pointed out that it is important for the Directors to learn about the
topics discussed – technology, demographics, TOC – from other sources outside
RTD. This is the kind of opportunity that can be attained by attending these types
of conferences. He mentioned that Directors James, Walker and he will be
attending Rail ~Volution at the end of the month and will have a report on that
conference to the Directors. Director Bagley added that each Director has a budget
of $6,000 for travel paid for by the public, for a total of $90,000. He believes that
Directors should be required to present a report after attending a conference. He
will continue to promote conference attendance and reports to the Board as long as
he is on the Board. Director Bagley added that he is working on getting copies of
the APTA Annual Meeting sessions presentations.
Director Menten wondered if the reports to the Board were already a recommended
action. Director Bagley replied that they are not at the moment.
Director Francone recommended the Directors search the Transit Cooperative
Research Program’s website for transit reading materials. They are available free of
charge and include a variety of topics. She informed the Directors she learned
about this resource during the APTA Annual Meeting.

C. Updates

• Sales and Use Tax Forecast Update
Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, reminded the Board that the Sales and
Use Tax forecasting done by the University of Colorado Leeds School of
Business (CU Leeds) is used in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), Annual
Program Evaluation (APE) and the Annual Budget. She introduced Robert
McNown, Richard Wobbekind and Brian Lewandowski from CU Leeds.
Robert McNown said it was a pleasure to be presenting to the Board this
evening. CU Leeds has appreciated the opportunity to work with RTD. He
reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the Board that is available in the
October 20, 2015 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda
Packet.
Robert McNown stressed that there is a lot of uncertainty involved in
forecasting. He shared that the short-term and medium-term forecasts are
affected by employment, personal income, and retail sales and taxable sales;
the long-term forecasts focus on changes in population and age distribution
which affect savings, labor supply, productivity, output, and household
expenditures. He noted that the rate of job growth and personal income
increase in Colorado has outpaced the National average.

Packet Pg. 40

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 20, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow was absent. Director Lasater left early.

Robert McNown stressed that there is always forecast uncertainty, which
requires CU Leeds to make frequent revisions as new information becomes
available. He pointed to a graph of Moody’s Gross Domestic Product
Expectations from March of 2013 through September of 2015 to illustrate
how much just one component of their forecasts could change in a relatively
short period of time. He commented that another factor creating uncertainty
in the forecasts was the addition of retail marijuana sales despite being a
small portion of RTD’s total revenue. He believes it is something the model
will adjust to gradually. He explained that the main factors that would
impact the 2015-2016 revenues would be:
 Improved Colorado employment, sales and personal income
expectations
 Change in taxable goods for RTD (tax parity with State of Colorado)
 Additional of marijuana retail sales
 Decreasing oil prices
Robert McNown stated that the forecasts were strong for 2015 and 2016 at
a change of 6.23% and 7.99% increase over the previous year. He said
that Sales and Use Tax will continue to increase over the long-term but the
rate of increase will begin to slow. He reiterated that the integrity of the
forecasts is very important to CU Leeds. This is insured through:
 Quarterly forecast updates to reflect the most current economic data
 Sales and Use Tax forecasts may be too high or too low, reflecting
uncertainty in the economy
 Theoretically sound economic relations are used to generate
forecasts, modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern
econometric time series analysis
 Forecasts do not incorporate “add factors” or other subjective
adjustments of model forecasts
 CU Leeds is independent from RTD with no political or financial stake
in the forecast numbers
Director Menten wondered what LBCI stood for as there was reference to
this acronym associated with wavering optimism related to the Colorado
economy on one of the slides. Richard Wobbekind explained that CU Leeds
produces a business confidence index on a quarterly basis. Approximately
400 Colorado firms are surveyed about how they feel about the conditions
and economy overall. He said it is a standard confidence index where over
50 is expansionary and below 50 is contractionary. He noted that the index
is still above 50 but over the last two quarters there has been a decline in
the index. He stated that there are clearly concerns about the national
economy as this has fallen below 50.

Director Solano asked for a laymen’s definition for the statement that read:
“forecasts are generated from theoretically sound economic relations,
modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern econometric time series
analysis”. Robert McNown explained that CU Leeds builds individual
equations based upon widely accepted macroeconomic theories. Those
equations are estimated with appropriate statistical methods and the validity
of the estimates are checked to determine if they meet various statistical
criteria. He said that the methodology used by CU Leeds pays a lot of
attention to the dynamic relationship between variables and takes into
account leads and lags. He stated that CU Leeds tries to incorporate the
gradual adjustment of variables into the model.
Chair Sisk wondered if CU Leeds had any idea what would happen to the
forecasts if internet sales were taxed. Brian Lewandowski shared that they
did a study on this for the City of Boulder about five years ago. He said that
if the tax base is broadened obviously more sales tax would be collected and
it would level the playing field for local retailers; however, he noted there are
so many taxing bases in the Denver Metro area that it would be nearly
impossible to implement.
Director Bagley believes that if a trend line was drawn from around 2005 the
line would come back to about where the tax is today. He said it is
important to note that underneath that line there would be a great deal of
white space, which is essentially sales tax that was lost. Richard
Wobbekind stated it was correct that in any recession a great deal of output
is lost that can never be recovered.
Director Bagley commented that when evaluating sales and use tax by
quarter, it always seems to be at its lowest for a year during quarter one.
He believes this is because people have expended a great deal coming into
the Christmas season so the first quarter is a low expenditure month.
Robert McNown stated that was correct that forecasts do fluctuate quarter
to quarter but it is a predictable fluctuation. Richard Wobbekind shared that
recently there has been a very strong weather effect in the first quarter that
is puzzling economists all over. It has dampened retail sales, home, sales,
etc. and then very strong second quarters followed. He said that forecasters
have yet to come up with a good way to include the effect in their
forecasting.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 20, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked who is polled as part of the index. She wonders if it
covers small, medium and large businesses and if it is random. Brian
Lewandowski explained that there is an established panel with a mix of
small and large businesses as well as a mix of all industries in the State.

6.F

Director Folska agreed that it is wonderful to have CU Leeds present.
Director Folska asked if they could provide her with the retail and medical
marijuana sales tax for 2015 thus far. Robert McNown said that to date
RTD has had sales tax revenue totaling about $2.4 million for retail
marijuana and $1.7 million for medical marijuana. He believes it would be
safe to project a total figure at around $6 million for the year. Director
Folska expressed that this number is so important to her because RTD is
looking for a way to fund a low income pass. She thinks this could be a
nice piece of that conversation as these are new sales tax revenues. She
said it would just matter how the Agency chose to allocate and use those
resources.
Director Menten asked if there had been any analysis done on how the
entities that have banned marijuana sales have affected potential revenues
for the State or RTD. Heather Copp stated that she could get additional
information from the Department of Revenue but even without those bans
Denver and the surrounding Metro area would still be the largest sales tax
generators for marijuana.
Director Menten wondered if the Hemp industry has begun to gain any
strength. Heather Copp believes there will continue to be an increase in the
Hemp industry; however, Hemp is regulated by the Department of
Agriculture so it will not generate the same kinds of sales tax as marijuana.
Committee Chair Tobiassen noted there have been two bubbles in the
economy since 2000 according to the State Taxable Retail Sales in the
District graph. In looking at the graph for 2015 he wonders if perhaps there
is not a bubble happening right now. Richard Wobbekind said the one thing
that could indicate a bubble right now is housing prices; however, he does
not think housing prices are bubbly but that they might be a constraint to
growth. He stated that he does not believe there is a bubble right now.
Director James said his perception is that many of the risk factors to the
economy come from offshore, like the uncertainty surrounding the Chinese
economy. He wondered if CU Leeds could address those. Robert McNown
stated that things like the Chinese economy are not factors in the forecasts
but that is why CU Leeds also prepares upper and lower bounds for the
forecast to reflect those unpredictable changes.

Director Bagley thanked CU Leeds for their presentation. He thinks it is

• 2016 Budget Update

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis,
reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the Board that is available in the
October 20, 2015 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda
Packet. She said the major budget assumptions for 2016 are:
 Sales and use tax increase based on revised CU Leeds September
forecast
 Diesel fuel cost at $2.23 per gallon vs $2.95 in 2015
 Unrestricted year-end fund balance for Base System projected at $5.2
million which is in line with the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
She stated that the budget challenges are:
 Grant revenue may be volatile due to budget challenges at national
level
 Funding challenges for remaining FasTracks projects build-out
 Cost allocation from Base System to FasTracks for costs of operating
lines
 Service payment to Denver Transit Operators for first time in 2016
totaling $57 million
 Pension and Health and Welfare plan contributions totaling $2.5
million necessary in 2016
The presentation also included information on sources of funding and uses
for both the Base System and FasTracks as well as on a combined basis.
The next step will be presentation of the 2016 Recommended Budget to the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee on November 10 with request
for Board Adoption on November 17.
Director Folska asked for the Communication Department’s budget for 2016.
Jannette Scarpino said for Base System the Communication’s Requested
Budget was about $14 million or about 3% of the Base System budget. For
FasTracks it was about $5.6 million or 2.6% of the FasTracks Requested
Budget.
Director Folska asked for the expected cost of electricity for 2016 given all
the new line openings. Interim General Manager Genova stated that cost
cuts across several departments so staff would have to get it for her.
Director Folska noted that there are new tax revenues from medical and
retail marijuana that will total about $6 million. She encouraged the
Directors to consider using this funding for a low income fare program.

Heather Copp stated this was the third presentation on the 2016 Requested
Budget. She reminded the Board that the September forecast from CU
Leeds has been incorporated into the Requested Budget.

Director Anderson commented that she believes good public policy when it
comes to budgets is to not earmark funds. She stated that RTD is opening
five new lines in 2016 so the Board needs to be very careful about taking
funding and applying it to something on a whim.
Director Menten asked for the dollar value of the capital carry forward.
Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that this had not yet been estimated
for 2016; however, as an example for 2014 on the Base System side the
capital carry forward was $170 million and on the FasTracks side it was
$817 million.
Committee Chair Tobiassen thanked staff for the hard work they do on the
budget. He noted that many, many Requested Budget items have been
whittled down and pushed off to future years so it is not like there is a great
deal of extra money.

• Fiscal Sustainability Task Force Recommendations Update
Heather Copp reminded the Board that this is the quarterly update to keep
the appraised of them status of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force
recommendations from November, 2010. She outlined the completed
recommendations as followed:
 Remove the volatility from sales and use tax projections through
contracting with the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business
 Service optimization through an 8% net reduction in service in 2012
 Adopting fund balance policies of three months operating expenses
for Base System and two months operating expenses for FasTracks
 Establish sales and use tax parity with the State effective January,
2014
 Comprehensive energy audit
Heather Copp said that the following recommendations were ongoing:
 Sales and use tax compliance reviews
 Naming rights
 Partnerships and privatization
She explained that the low priority recommendations continue to remain a
low priority and staff has not been actively pursuing them.

Director James pointed out that change in diesel fuel price is very
noticeable. He wondered if staff could provide a comparison between the
total cost per year from when diesel peaked in 2013 to 2016’s lock.
Heather Copp noted that from 2015 to 2016 the decreased price per gallon
for diesel would result in a savings of about $6 million. Jannette Scarpino
said she would prepare a comparison from 2013 to 2016.

6.F

Director Solano commented that revenues from marijuana sales tax at $6
million and the recently approved naming rights at $5 million is very close to
the $11 million needed annually for a low income pass program. Jannette
Scarpino explained that the naming rights did not provide a yearly revenue
figure of $5 million; RTD will receive approximately $1 million per year for
five years. Scott Reed noted that the advertising policy recently changed
which was likely to result in a decrease in that revenue.

• FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) Update
Heather Copp reminded the Board that in 2012 staff presented an initiative
to identify opportunities to provide additional funding for FasTracks projects
with a goal of $300 million by 2017, which was called the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA). The goals for the use of the FISA funds
were: (1) completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit Project, (2) Construction of
North Metro to at least 72nd Avenue and (3) Any remaining funds above the
$300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially-funded projects at the Board’s
Discretion. She explained that some of the figures initially presented have
changed significantly since then and wanted to walk the Board through the
reasoning.
Heather Copp reviewed the following FISA items with the Board with their
status:
 Evaluate FasTracks Funding for Base System Operations
Initially when FasTracks was approved, a provision was made
whereby FasTracks would provide funding each year to the Base
System for additional bus service necessary for feeder service to new
rail corridors. This was initially programed at 1% per year between
2006 and 2020 and 1.5% between 2021 and 2025. Staff
recommended that this funding be limited to the growth in the
Consumer Price Index, which staff believed would generate $24
million through 2017.
Heather Copp stated that to-date there has been $7.8 million
contributed to the FISA and staff feels confident that the remainder
will be realized through 2017 to bring the total to $24 million.

Director Francone noted that in the report under sales and use tax
compliance reviews it noted that Revenue Recovery Group had issued
assessments totaling $600K versus costs of $520K. She wondered if that
meant RTD had collected $600K. Heather Copp stated that she would
explain this further during the FasTracks Internal Savings Account update as
there is a huge difference between assessments and collections.

Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance
As FasTracks projects were completed, it was assumed that the need
to maintain $150 million of unrestricted fund balances to address
unforeseen construction expenditures would diminish. By 2017 it
was assumed that $72 million of this fund balance could be available
for the FISA.
Heather Copp explained that these funds did become available;
however, instead of that money coming through the FISA it was used
to offset other costs and overruns in the FasTracks Program. She
said there will be no additional funds to add to the FISA from the
unrestricted fund balances through 2017.
Reduce FasTracks Operation and Maintenance Fund Balance from 3
to 2 Months
The RTD Fiscal Policy set a target for the Base System unrestricted
reserves of 3 months operating expenses. The Fiscal Policy was
modified for FasTracks operations to set a reserve of 2 months of
operating expenses with the 3rd month being set aside for the FISA.
Heather Copp stated this had been done and staff expected to have
approximately $11.5 million in the FISA from this action. She
explained that it would not grow beyond that as after all the line
openings through 2017 the FasTracks operations unrestricted
reserves will go back to 3 months’ worth of expenses.
Defer Southwest Corridor Union Pacific Railroad Relocation
The FasTracks Financial Plan included a 2014 expenditure of $9
million to relocate a portion of the Union Pacific Railroad for
construction of the Southwest Corridor extension. It was suggested
this be delayed until the Southwest Corridor extension was fully
funded and the funds allocated for the relocation of $9 million be put
in the FISA.
Heather Copp noted this had been deferred and that the $9 million
was available in the FISA.
Achieve Cost Underruns on FasTracks Projects
It was assumed that as FasTracks corridors were completed, up to
$15 million could be saved through cost savings.
Heather Copp explained that these cost savings were reprogrammed
back into FasTracks to address additional project elements for the
North Metro Line through 125th Avenue that were approved through
the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) in 2015. There would be no
additional funds for the FISA from this item through 2017.
Sales/Lease Opportunities for all RTD Properties
As part of the FISA a goals was set to identify properties to sell or
lease that could generate $20 million by 2017.
Heather Copp stated that to-date $5.6 million has been realized for
the FISA. She said that the sales of Civic Center air rights generated
$8.1 million. Of the $8.1 million, $2.5 million was used for the

Northwest Area Mobility Study. She noted that staff will continue to
look at sales and lease opportunities but at this time she does not
have an estimate on what will be realized by 2017. She pointed out
that a lot of RTD properties, especially on the FasTracks side, have
used federal funds which does impact the sale/lease of the properties
and how the funds might be allocated.
Request Increase in Local Participation Above Current 2.5%
As part of the FISA the goal was established to pursue participation
above the required 2.5% local match.
Heather Copp said that this had happened for the Southeast Rail
Extension and these funds are designated in the FISA for construction
of that extension. She stated at this time the amount realized from
this item is still unknown.
Sales Tax Audit/Parity
As a result of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations in
2011, it was assumed that RTD could enhance sales and use tax
revenues through a combination of self-collection, which was
eventually revised to be supplemental tax audits, and establishing
parity with the State. The goal for these two items for the FISA was
$127 million.
Heather Copp noted that RTD was able to establish parity with the
State beginning in January, 2014. She shared that staff believes the
parity has generated some additional revenue; however, the ability to
determine how much additional revenue generated is virtually
impossible. She stated that even the Department of Revenue cannot
tell RTD because the tax forms do not include that level of detail.
She said that the sales and use tax is already accounted for in the
Strategic Budget Plan so no funds will go to the FISA from this item.
Heather Copp stated that related to RTD’s external audits, her
recommendation is that RTD no longer continue contracting for these
services. She pointed out that to date the efforts of RTD’s external
audit company, Revenue Recovery Group (RRG), had resulted in
assessments of approximately $650K and costs of $500K. She
explained that an assessment if very different than a collection. In an
assessment, RRG has reviewed a company and determined that they
owe additional taxes other than what they company reported. This
assessment is submitted to the Department of Revenue for review. If
the Department of Revenue agrees they will send a bill to the
customer but it is possible the Department of Revenue might not
agree with the assessment. Once the customer receives the bill the
customer has several options. Unless the customer pays the bill
outright, which they usually do not do, there are several options that
can reduce the amount paid to RTD and take quite some time to
resolve. Heather Copp believes that RTD will end up paying more to

Packet Pg. 48

6.F

RRG than is ever actually collected. She does not think there will be
any funds available to the FISA from this recommendation.

Director Menten said she cannot tell staff how absolutely pleased she is that
they are recommending RTD not continue the contract with RRG. She does
not believe there are business owners intentionally evading taxes. If there
are additional funds they owe it is through little mistakes because the taxing
is so complicated.
Director Menten inquired if the ballot language from the 2004 approval of
FasTracks included the 1% contribution to the Base System. She was
concerned that moving to the CPI might be going against what the voters
voted for. She also wondered if our paratransit service might suffer the
most by decreasing the funding. Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that
the ballot language did not specify that 1% of FasTracks funding would go
to the Base System. She said that as far as paratransit service, the Federal
ADA requirement says that RTD must provide paratransit service a certain
distance from our fixed-route service at certain times. The change in
FasTracks funding will in no way impact how RTD provides paratransit
service.
Director Folska believes that as it relates to the sale and lease of RTD
properties it is very important that the Board have an inventory of all RTD’s
real property. Heather Copp said she thought that would be provided as one
of the outcomes from the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) assessment.
Director Folska stated that the Board had been in talks with the TOD
department about this long before that assessment began. She commented
that the Board has been asking for that inventory for over two years and it is
time to make it a priority. Chair Sisk commented that the property inventory
was sent earlier in the day but while the Board was participating in the
General Manager Executive Search Committee so not everyone had the
chance to see it.
Director Bagley asked staff to put the information into a one-page table so it
was easy to look at in a comprehensive manner. He said he would get with
staff offline to discuss this.

Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 20, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Heather Copp stated that in summary, it is estimated that by 2017 the FISA
recommendations will result in funds of $86.7 million. She said that after
accounting for approved items for the US 36 BRT, North Metro Rail Line and
Southeast Rail Extension the remaining balance will be $34.3 million. She
explained that funds were programmed in the APE for debt service and
operations for already funded FasTracks Projects.

Director Hoy thanked staff for all their work. He shared with the Board that
he has had several meetings with staff related to the FISA. He noted that
the uses of the FISA funds had been outlined by Heather Copp. He asked if
he was to presume that the uses outlined were the only uses for the FISA
funds. He stated that the use of FISA funds to pay down debt service really
surprised him. He said that his impression was that FISA funds would
always be used to get tracks on the ground, build BRTs, etc. Heather Copp
stated those were the only uses identified at this time. She said the
discussion of using FISA funds for debt service and operations could be
addressed when the APE was brought to the Board in 2016. She expressed
that she was not sure it was clear to the Board that debt service and
operations was one of the funding sources use to balance the APE.
Director Hoy noted that there were FISA funds used for certain FasTracks
projects that bypassed the FISA. He suggested that in the future if it is
supposed to run through the FISA that is what happens. He believes this
will make it a clearer process to the Board. Heather Copp stated that staff
would definitely do that in the future.
Chair Sisk thinks that the FISA really needs to be scrutinized. He said that
what he understands this evening is that the FISA will no longer be used for
building additional projects as was promised but for financing completed
projects. He shared that he does not think this is what the Board intended.
Chair Sisk stated that the other issue is to really understand where the $300
million estimate came from. He feels this is a very significant deviation and
something that deserves an explanation.
Director James pointed out that the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force was
something that was developed when the economy was terrible. He said that
some of the items that were recommended in retrospect were worthwhile
while others were not; however, the scrutiny that resulted from that Task
Force was a really good thing for RTD to find the money hiding under the
couch cushions. Heather Copp agreed that the Task Force really brought the
discussions of finding additional revenue to the forefront. She believes there
was a genuine intent to find every dollar available. She stated that the sales
tax audits were an endeavor that was worthwhile but RTD has since learned
there were not many holes in the State’s process; however, we would never
have known had we not investigated the opportunity.
Director Anderson believes that the idea of auditing only makes sense if RTD
had home rule. She said that is the piece that was missing as part of the
recommendation. Heather Copp stated she would agree with that,
especially now that RTD has parity with the State.

Committee Chair Tobiassen shared that at his Telephone Town Hall someone
made the comment that there is a billion dollar surplus that RTD will
generate over the next few years. He said he was stunned by this
comment. He believes that the FISA is where this person thought the
surplus was coming from. He believes it is very important that RTD set the
expectations that this is not the case nor are FISA funds being earmarked for
someone’s pet project. He thanked Heather for the clarification and reality
of the FISA.

Doug MacLeod, Controller, pointed out that the August Monthly Financial
Status Report was included in the October 20, 2015 Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet. He noted that there is
a continuing trend where the revenues are still under budget; however, in
July we were $6 million under budget while as of August it was $3 million
so there is some improvement. He said that expenses are easier to adjust
than revenue. He stated that as of August, expenses were further under
budget than revenue.
There were no questions from the Board.

• Smart Media Technology (SMT) and Day Pass Printer Status
Heather Copp stated that the Smart Media Technology Report was included
in the October 20, 2015 Financial Administration and Audit Committee
Agenda Packet. She pointed out that there is a new line item for rider
experience as a result of the phase I pilot program. She said there were
some concerns as a result of the pilot that staff was continuing to explore as
part of phase II.
Director Francone inquired as to the color of the day pass printers. Kim
Heldman, Senior Manager of Information Technology, said she believes they
are green but will confirm.
Director Bagley asked, given there are only 70 days left in the year, if
Interim General Manager Genova felt confident the Smart Cards would work
on January 1, 2016. Interim General Manager Genova stated that
technically the pilots had been going very well. He said he remained highly
confident that RTD would hit the January 1, 2016 stored value roll out of
the Smart Cards.

B. Recommended Actions

• January 2016 Service Plan
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the January 2016 Service Change package
as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost
of approximately $870,350 and, further, to authorize the General Manager
or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the October 27, 2015 Board
meeting.
Chair Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations,
reminded the Directors that staff had already presented a draft
of the January 2016 Service Plan to the Board. He noted that
staff has since gone to public meetings. The changes made to
the Service Plan from the feedback received are highlighted in
yellow in the Board Report.
Jessie Carter, Manager for Service Planning and Scheduling,
explained that most of the changes are routine schedule
adjustments. He highlighted routes 3 and 10 as these routes

include some rerouting. The maps explaining the new routes
were included in the Board Report.

Director Francone thanked staff on behalf of her nieces and
nephews, who attend East High School in Denver, for
improving the service in the area.
Committee Chair Anderson said that she understands that
closing a Park-n-Ride is difficult. She added that after talking
to staff, she learned that only 2 people attended the public
hearing to discuss this change. Staff noted that there are
other parking options nearby.
Director Deadwyler shared the concern of several people in her
District relating to the reduction of bus services. She asked
staff to reassure her that people will not complain once all the
service changes go live in 2016. Jessie Carter pointed out
that more information on those bus routes covering Montbello
and the Green Valley Ranch area will be included in the East
Line/225 Line Service Planning Update to be presented later in
the meeting.
Director Francone asked about the Lockheed Martin Call-nRide. She pointed out that during the August Service Changes
this Call-n-Ride was recommended for discontinuation. Bruce
Abel said that this Call-n-Ride has been reduced to one
subscription per day. Jessie Carter told Director Francone that
Brian Matthews, Manager for Special Services, could give her
a further update.
Director Menten pointed out that Route 76 stops at Southwest
Plaza. Some of her constituents would like the route to
extend further south to the nearby medical facility. She asked
staff when was the last time this route was discussed for
possible changes. Jessie Carter replied that route 76 has been
revisited recently as this topic has been brought up in a few
community meetings. Staff is continuing these conversations.

Packet Pg. 55

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 20, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Jessie Carter added that there were 3 public hearings held
with a total attendance of 41 people. Bruce Abel pointed out
that the total cost for the service changes is estimated at
$870,350, with an estimated $139,750 in grant funding,
making the Service Plan net cost $730.600.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that
RTD staff be authorized to make changes to the RTD Non-Profit Agency
Reduced Fare Program as detailed in Attachment A of this action to be
implemented by January 1, 2016.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the October 27,
2015 Board meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Tony McCaulay, Senior Manager of Marketing, noted that the
recommended action has no changes since the update
presented during the September Study Session. Staff finished
surveying the 360 staff members from current participating
agencies and received 28 responses. He added that several
agencies did express concern over the proposed change in the
discount for 10-Ride Ticket Books from the current 60% to
50%. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for
Communications, handed out Attachment A to the Directors
as it was omitted from the recommended action Board report
by mistake. The attachment was emailed to the Directors
prior to the meeting.
Director Hoy shared that he was a bit troubled by the
recommended action. During the Financial Administration and
Audit Committee meeting prior to the Operations and
Customer Service Committee meeting, the conversation
revolved around balancing the budget and sustainability. He
noted that the proposed January Service Plan increased in
service by $800,000, yet this recommended action asks to
cut revenues by $400,000. He pointed out that RTD cannot
cut revenues and increase service. He noted that he would
vote no and asked staff to look at the numbers for the NonProfit Agency Reduced Fare Program and at least make it
revenue neutral.

• Recommended Changes to the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program

6.G

Director Francone mentioned that her second concern is along
the lines of Director Hoy’s concerns. She asked staff to speak
to why it seems there is a deficit of $1 million dollars. Tony
McCaulay explained that under the current program RTD
would receive $2.5 million in revenue of the $5.8 fare media
face value. Staff is recommending a face value annual cap of
$6.8 million since they are expecting an increase in demand.
If the cap is met, RTD revenue would increase from $2.5
million to $3.4 million. He added that even though staff is
anticipating an increase in demand staff cannot predict what
the increase will be. Scott Reed noted that the estimation is a
guess since staff has no way of knowing what would have
been bought at full fare versus helping accommodate low
income riders; however, staff felt that the way the
recommended action is presented is the most logical way to
proceed.
Director James suggested that in the future the performance
of this program be measured in both revenue to RTD and
number of rides provided. Tony McCaulay noted that the
current 10-Ride Ticket Books are able to measure both of
those metrics but not passes. He suggested providing a
survey to the non-profit agencies where clients receiving
monthly passes could estimate the number of rides taken in a
month. He added that once SmartCard data is available both
metrics would be easier to track. Director James agreed that
SmartCard data will provide really interesting information.
Director James noted that the proposed discount for the 10Ride Ticket Books from the current 60% to 50% is a good
idea as it creates consistency throughout the agency-wide fare
structure.

Packet Pg. 57

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 20, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone thanked staff for their work. She noted that
she had two issues. She is concerned that allowing the
agencies to return unused passes would create an additional
administrative burden to RTD. She worries that since this is a
new product there may be the possibility of agencies
overestimating their needs. Scott Reed explained that he has
had conversations with the Operations Accounting staff and
they have assured him that this new responsibility will not be
extremely burdensome as these types of transactions are
already part of their responsibilities.

Director James pointed out that the discounted fare media is
only available through the participating non-profit agencies.
He wondered what would be the consequences for the nonprofits issuing a type of verification confirmation and the
eligible customers purchasing the fare media through other
fare media outlets. Scott Reed replied that there are 240
agencies participating in the program, meaning that the
accessibility of the discounted passes is not limited. He added
that most people who purchase the discounted fare media
through the agencies utilize the agencies as a one-stop shop
for other safety net programs. Currently clients may have to
do multiple trips to the agencies because the number of
passes is limited. Under the recommended action, the
agencies will be able to provide more passes in one visit.
Scott Reed added that RTD would have a difficult time
empowering the agencies to issue some sort of ID to proof
eligibility, he does not think that the agencies would like that
burden either, and this would add a different type of scenario
for the other sales outlets.
Scott Reed noted that RTD continues to work with Mile High
Connects to address a joint funding scenario for low income
fares. That program has identified an $11 million cost for an
ID card program for which to date no funding partner has been
identified. He pointed out that the current recommended
action focuses on the restructuring of the Non-Profit Agency
Reduced Fare program. Director James noted that it sounds
like staff is willing to explore different options and make future
changes as the conversation develops. Scott Reed confirmed
that staff is committed to continuing the process.
Director Tobiassen reminded the Directors that this
recommended action is for the simplification of the current
Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare program and not the program
in the works with Mile High Connects. The clients that are
part of the this program are the poorest of the poor, not the
working poor. He noted that these are the people that need
the most help. He added that RTD has other very worthy
programs, like Senior, Student, and Disability discounts as well
as Active Military free fare. He said he will support this
program 100% as it is also very worthy. He shared that his
son drives an ambulance and that many times he has taken
someone to the hospital that, once discharged, is not able to
get home. He suggested adding hospitals to this program to
aid in those kinds of cases.

Director Francone wondered if the Non-Profit Agency Reduced
Fare Program has any impact on RTD statutory obligation on
collecting certain percentage of revenue from fares. Marla
Lien, General Counsel, replied that the statutory definition is
not an accounting definition as it ties too many other activities
within RTD. She said that RTD overall exceeds the recovery
requirements. She added that the fare box revenue gets
averaged between those paying regular and discounted fares.
Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, told Director Francone
she will provide her with the correct calculation. She added
that the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare program would have
to increase exponentially to affect the statutory obligation.
Director Bagley noted that Director Tobiassen made a
compelling comment and that all the discounts provided by
RTD are very worthy. He trusts that the people utilizing the
Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare program are the poorest of
the poor. He told the Directors that it is time to take a vote.
Director Walker pointed out that he will support this
recommended action. He mentioned that he has not paid for a
fare pass in 4 years yet he regularly buys fares for his
daughter and her friends. He mentioned that this
recommended action will do a lot of good for a lot of people.
Committee Chair Anderson reminded the Directors that several
months ago the Board asked staff to streamline the process.
She believes staff has done a good job on anticipating more
sales of the discounted fare for the poorest of the poor. She
said that she will be supporting this recommended action
because it essentially does not change current practices. She
added that as the metro region grows more poor people will
not be able to afford transit.

• Free Rides for Members of the Military
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that
free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military
should be extended from the presently approved date of December 31, 2015
to December 31, 2016. Utilization has been minimal to date and this
extension will have minimal impact on RTD.
Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board during the October 27,
2015 Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Committee Chair Anderson noted that this was very fitting
given the forthcoming commemoration of Veteran’s Day.
Chair Sisk called for the question.

C. Updates

 New Year's Eve/Day Free Fare (no back-up)
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, reminded the
Directors that RTD in the past has offered free fares starting at 7:00 p.m. on
New Year’s Eve until 7:00 a.m. New Year’s Day. This year, the free fare will
start on New Year’s Eve at 7:00 p.m. until Midnight, January 2, 2016. This
means that throughout all of January 1, 2016 RTD will provide free fares.
This is meant to aid in the transition into the new fare structure effective
January 1, 2016.



Arapahoe park-n-Ride Update (no back-up)
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager, reminded the Board that the City of
Greenwood Village owned the surface parking lot where the Arapahoe Parkn-Ride is located. Greenwood Village allowed RTD patrons to park on the
premises once the Arapahoe Station opened until the land was sold for
development.

Packet Pg. 60

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 20, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Motion:

6.G

On September 30, 2015, the land was sold and a developer closed on the
property. There has been no parking allowed since that date. The developer
is not set to break ground until February, 2016 and has since decided to
allow for RTD patrons to park there until then.

 East Line/225 Line Service Planning Update (no back-up)

Jessie Carter, Manager for Service Planning and Scheduling, told the
Directors that there were 6 public meetings held with a total of 100 people
in attendance. Staff continues to receive briefing requests from
organizations and municipalities. He added that he is glad there is some
opposition at the beginning of this program because people are being
proactive providing their feedback. Due to this feedback, several changes
are being made:
 Maintaining Route 28 in the Park Hill area
 Maintaining service on 44th Ave in the Green Valley Ranch area
Director Tobiassen mentioned that staff continues to be in conversation with
the Buckley Air Force Base regarding route 169. Bruce Abel added that the
conversation includes route 169 L.
Director Deadwyler shared the angst from some of the constituents in her
District because it seems that RTD is forcing people to use the train by
eliminating routes and trips. She would like staff to assure her that people
will get to their destinations without the problems encountered during the
opening of the W rail line. Jessie Carter replied that he cannot promise that
everyone will be happy. He added that the University of Colorado A Line
will be more reliable with frequent service to the area. Director Deadwyler
noted that she is not worried about the train; she is worried about the buses
that will take them to the train. Jessie Carter gave the example that the trip
on route 47X from Montbello to Denver Union Station (DUS) currently is 47
minutes. The trip from Smith and Peoria to DUS on the University of
Colorado A Line will be 16 minutes. Even when factoring in the bus transfer
the trip from Montbello will be significantly shorter. Director Deadwyler
noted that not everyone will be on the 47X and they would be at other
stops, like Airport and 40th. Jessie Carter replied that this is where other
routes come into play, for example, the AF, which also has significant time
reductions when utilizing the University of Colorado A Line. Bruce Abel
added that staff continues to engage the community to get the message out
on the advantages of the new lines as well as listening to the concerns of
the public, revisiting changes and fleshing out a better service timeline.
Jessie Carter added that the proposed 3 routes that would replace the

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, told the
Directors that staff will come back to the Board with changes from the
feedback received during the public meetings currently being held. Staff
plans to come back to the Board with a recommended action in November.

6.G

current 4 routes in the Montbello area will have a longer span of service and
will operate more frequently.

 16th Street Mall Update (no back-up)

He added that during the meeting with Denver and their consultants to
debrief the 5 Meet in the Streets, the consultant concluded:
 RTD Free Mall Ride ridership decreased from 18,000 to 6,000 to
7,000
 Pedestrian traffic on the Mall was 30% higher, which is approximate
weekday traffic
 There was a 40% increase of children participation.
 90% of merchants reported equal or better sales volume.
He added that one of the items Denver has been forthright about is
wondering how the Free Mall Ride ties in with the revisioning of Downtown
Denver. RTD believes that the Free Mall Ride is the backbone of the
agency’s operations with 45,000 boardings a day. RTD is willing to look at
what Sundays may look like. Denver may ask RTD what it would look like
for the Free Mall Ride to run on 15th Street and 17th Street on Saturdays and
Sundays from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day weekend. RTD’s
position is that a lot of studies would need to take place in order to arrive at
that place.
Committee Chair Anderson said that her question for Denver would be if
they are willing to pay for the road repairs in order for the Free Mall Ride
buses to run on 15th Street and 17th Street.
Director Menten asked staff to get more specific numbers as 90% of
merchants reporting equal or better sales volume does not really give much
information.
Director James reminded the Directors that the DDP will have a forum on
Wednesday, October 21st, at 7:30 a.m. to discuss the future of the 16th
Street Mall.
Director James asked if the increase of pedestrian on the Mall was due to
the removal of the buses or to the promoting of the activities being held.
Bruce Abel replied that those points are part of the conversation: what does
the 16th Street Mall look like when it is activated with programing versus not
Packet Pg. 62

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 20, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, mentioned that
staff has been working with the City and County of Denver (Denver) as well
as the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) to evaluate what they are
calling the “revisioning” of the 16th Street Mall. He noted that RTD
participated in the 5 Meet in the Streets Sundays that were meant to
activate the 16th Street Mall.

6.G

Director Folska pointed out that RTD just bought Mall buses that could only
operate on the 16th Street Mall. She wondered if there were any statutory
penalties for not operating on the Mall. Bruce Abel noted that the recently
purchased buses will be able to operate at two levels, making them
functional on both 16th Street as well as regular streets. Marla Lien, General
Counsel, said that there were no statutory implications as the 16th Street
Mall is a Denver public right of way, thus what RTD does on the Mall is up
to Denver.
Director Walker pointed out that he is not married to the idea of the bus on
the 16th Street Mall. He noted that RTD needs to provide transportation
during the week. He added that if Denver is willing to provide another type
of environment for our customers to be transported throughout Downtown
then he is willing to work with them.
Director Bagley said that there are many other issues that affect the 16th
Street Mall beyond the Mall Ride buses: urban camping, homelessness,
marijuana, general overall security at the light rail stations, and the design of
the transit way. He does not think that he will ever support the removal of
the Free Mall Ride from 16th Street.

 College Pass Program Update (no back-up)
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager, reminded the Directors that the
College Pass Program was up for review under the Fare Study Task Force.
The program was evaluated using the same methodology as the EcoPass
program: average revenue per boarding. He said that the findings conclude
that the average fare received based on the contract amount and utilization
of services fulfills the expectations of the program. Given this information,
the consultants, CH2M Hill and staff are not recommending any changes on
the College Pass Program to the Board.

 Safety Campaign Update (no back-up)
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, mentioned that
safety is a focus of everything that we do. He added that “gloom and
doom” messaging does not resonate with today’s audience.
Steve Reilly, Manager for Marketing Communications, noted that safety is a
huge concern and consideration especially with the opening of 5 new lines
and introducing of new modes of transportation. This campaign would be a
system wide campaign that takes a more humorous and disarming approach
to safety. He noted that RTD partnered with Metro Melbourne of Australia
Packet Pg. 63

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 20, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

activated. RTD wants to make sure that we protect our customer base
while collaborating with Denver. Director James noted that he is glad RTD
is part of the conversation.

6.G

Steve Reilly proceeded to play the video for the campaign as well as a 30
second edited video which highlights the transit elements. He added that
the methodology is to use the online pledge to engage the public. The
campaign will kick off with a social media blitz which will send the
characters from Melbourne to Denver on October 28th. RTD will invite the
local media on October 29th to the characters overnight takeover of the
Denver Union Station bus concourse. The campaign will include train wraps,
bus wraps, print media, character/mascot interaction, etc. The campaign is
expected to grow by introducing Denver based characters. The campaign
will be translated into Spanish and the website will be translatable. The goal
is to cater to as many people as possible.
Scott Reed added that the campaign is a proven product. He noted that it
would have been impossible for RTD to create an original campaign without
spending hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. He pointed out
that the challenge will be getting through the thousands of messages that
people are bombarded with in a day.
Steve Reilly pointed out that the launch is intentionally planned around
Halloween as people in costume draw more attention during this time. The
characters will be present at Boo at the Zoo and the Children’s Museum,
among other places, as it will be a portable installation.
Director Folska thanked staff for the very well thought out and integrated
campaign. She noted that she can sense the passion from staff. She thinks
the campaign will be a great success.
Director James asked if there are any measurable results from the campaign
and what could RTD expect as a result. Steve Reilly replied that the
campaign worldwide has produced the results noted earlier. In addition to
those metrics, the program has generated 700 news stories providing $15
million in “ad value” if they had to pay for that media exposure.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley asked Dave Genova, Interim General Manager, for a report on the
State Audit of RTD Hearing held earlier in the day. Dave Genova noted that the
audit concentrated around the use of electronic devices by operators, fitness for
duty, and drug and alcohol policy. The audit looked at how RTD handles these
Packet Pg. 64

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 20, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

to adapt their successful campaign for the Denver audience. The program
as used in Australia and other European countries has produced:
 30% reduction in preventable accidents
 127 million online pledges to be safe around transit
 100 million video views
 150 million digital downloads
 5 million shares on social media

6.G

Marla Lien, General Counsel, mentioned that the audit report was released by the
committee. Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, noted
that there are copies available at the Board Office.
Dave Genova told the Directors that the State released a press release on the audit.
Chair Sisk noted that the most egregious act cited during the audit hearing was a
bus operator driving at 75 mph in a 45 mph zone while on his cell phone. That
instance stuck with the legislators as it should have. The operator was suspended
for that action and later terminated for being absent. He added that that kind of
incident does not look good on RTD.

issues internally as well as how RTD manages our private contractors on these
matters. The audit made 3 recommendations related to electronic devices and 3
recommendations related to private carrier oversight for documentation. He noted
that RTD worked closely with the audit committee and agreed with all 6
recommendations with pretty reasonable implementation time. During the
presentation the committee asked questions about the disciplinary process and how
it works progressively as well as drug testing policy, consequences and how these
are all negotiated with the Collective Bargaining Unit.

Motion to Approve the Board Protocols for Community Engagement and Events
Chair Pro tem Menten asked for a motion to approve this item.
Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to approve this item.
Director Walker seconded the motion

Discussion:

Director Hoy indicated he did not see the need for this
item. Chair Pro tem Menten inquired if the full Board
had seen the redlined copy and requested it be sent to
the full Board. Director Bagley concurred he did not
feel it was necessary. Director Tobiassen expressed
that it felt like we were nitpicking and asked why this
needed to be formalized.
Chair Sisk provided the background of the event with
CDOT that precipitated the revival of this issue. These
were protocols or common courtesies that have always
existed but just not formalized. He personally believes
we need some flexibility in who attends certain

Paula Perdue provided further background. She stated
that since she has been here there has always been
some form of protocols around Board members and
who attends what events. These are common
courtesies and were pretty well understood. As we
have transitioned to a new Board and new staff,
particularly the PI team, this knowledge around
common courtesy is being lost. There are a number of
faux pas occurring every day which is frustrating Board
members. She has heard from a number of Board
members who are upset around not being invited to
speak at (or even attend) an event that is being held in
their District. Formalizing this document is a way of
educating Board members and staff on appropriate
protocols for outreaching to Board members as we go
forward. Interim General Manager Genova expressed
this just puts everyone on an equal footing as it relates
to expectations.

Motion:

The motion passed with the full committee in
agreement.

October Board Meeting Agenda Review
Interim General Manager Genova reviewed the Board agenda for Tuesday, October 27. He
noted we would be recognizing a number of people including the participants in the bus
and light rail roadeo; this is important to recognize and he has asked his staff to move
expeditiously through the process. IGM Genova walked through the agenda noting which
items had passed unanimously and which items would be on recommended action. We
are not anticipating any major issues.
Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to move the October
Board agenda before the full Board on October 27,
2015.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

A.

January 2016 Service Plan

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the January 2016 Service Change package as revised
and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately
$870,350 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
B.

Free Rides for Members of the Military

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free
rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should be
extended from the presently approved date of December 31, 2015 to December
31, 2016. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal
impact on RTD.

Recommended Changes to the Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that RTD staff
be authorized to make changes to the RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare
Program as detailed in Attachment A of this action to be implemented by January
1, 2016.

D.

Board Protocols for Community Engagement and Events

It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board of Directors adopt
these guidelines for planning RTD public hearings, public meetings and special
events to coordinate with RTD Board members’ schedules, and for informing Board
members and senior leadership of relevant third-party meetings and events.
IV.

Other Matters


Director Anderson expressed there were a number of things she has been mulling
over pertaining to the Board and committee meetings that are getting longer and
longer. Last Tuesday was excessive having started at 1:00 p.m. She did not see
the value of going from 5:30 p.m. to 9:00 rehashing the budget when it has been

Packet Pg. 68

presented many times leading up to the October meeting. Board members must do
their due diligence in preparation and work with staff on the items they do not
understand. We need to spend our time on important matters. She also does not
understand why we need to have the Civil Rights meetings. We used to have less
Civil rights meetings but now they are part of the committee of the whole. Of
course this does not mean the Board is not concerned about civil rights; this agency
is committed to civil rights. Perhaps they could just include an update in our
packets. She also does not understand why we have to have Legislative
Committee meetings every month. Many of the issues are constitutional and there
is not really anything we can do about them. This appears a waste of our
lobbyists’ time to come to these meetings and wait; this information update could
also be included in the Board packets. Directors should come to the meetings
prepared and read their packets. Some of the updates are important but more
recently some of these should be a study session item instead of an update. She
just feels there is a way for us to have more effective meetings and reduce the
level of frustration. Her bottom line is we have very important work to do in 2016
with the openings of 5 new lines. She is pleading with her fellow Board members
to look for ways to focus on the important issues during our meetings and to make
this a less frustrating exercise, to get on with the business of this agency.
Director Anderson expressed that she felt the Board should have been notified of
the State findings before it hitting the newspaper. Safety is our # 1 priority.
Chair Sisk replied to the statement of the State audit noting this was a confidential
process and information could not be released in advance. He agreed also with the
other statements made about increasing our meeting effectiveness and we need to
look for ways to shorten the meetings. Chair Sisk noted the safety campaign and if
it could be shortened or timing changed. He did not feel we needed to beleaguer
the point on the safety update. IGM Genova expressed the staff is very sensitive
to the time also and AGM Reed understood that but was trying to be responsive to
a previous request by the Board for this information.
Director Walker agreed with much of what was said but stated he feels it is also
disrespectful of Board members to leave while staff is presenting. We need to be
respectful of their time and work to present information to this Board.
Director Hoy shared a discussion that he has been having with the FasTracks
leadership. As we complete projects, there may be times when a meeting is not
needed. They are looking at their options for how to effectively manage the
FasTracks committee. Director Hoy also noted the Board was giving staff mixed
messages.
Paula Perdue requested permission to comment. She noted and agreed with much
of what Director Anderson had to say. There is ample opportunity to have more
effective meetings. It is definitely within the purview of the Chair of the Board to
review the committee structures and make recommendations for change. We have

Packet Pg. 69

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 22, 2015 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

had a number of committees that have terminated when the business was finished;
it is definitely possible to roll FasTracks into another committee such as P&D or to
put together a committee of Board members and SLT to provide recommendations
back to the Board around committees. Pertaining to Civil Rights, in the past Civil
Rights was an adhoc committee and only came before the Board on important
matters or action items. Two years ago the Board changed it to a standing
committee with all rights of a standing committee; even today Civil Rights does not
come before the Board every month. Likewise, with the Legislative Committee. It
used to only come before the Board when the Legislature was in session
(September through May period); however, it is within the purview of the Chair to
decide when a meeting is needed. This Board needs to become more self-policing
and regulate itself accordingly. The problem in implementing some of what has
been suggested is this Board cannot agree upon what is important. Each one of the
members have his/her own priority list so who will say when an item is pure
operational or if it merits a discussion before the full Board. The Board gives out
mixed signals to staff. There are some Board members who want more information
and some who wants less. She thinks taking a look at the current committee
structures is certainly merited. In the end, the Board and the Chair of the
Committees need to monitor and control their respective meetings.
Director Francone commented as Vice-Chair of the Legislative Committee that it is
within the purview of the Chair of that Committee to determine when meetings are
needed. They believe there are valuable things occurring on a state and local basis
that may necessitate more meetings. Obviously there are different ways to handle
this and it may not be needed to have the lobbyists at every meeting; however,
they believe they have added value to the relationship between RTD, our
Congressional and State representatives by expanding their horizon and offering a
chance for these new representatives to learn about RTD.
Director Bagley commented it is incumbent on the Board members to do their
homework and come to the meeting prepared. He sees no use for the Government
Relations (Legislative Committee) having our lobbyists to come and talk about
irrelevant things. He is indeed highly frustrated with this Committee. Pertaining to
the State audit, this was sent as a confidential document yesterday afternoon. He
does not know how Board members felt they could speak on behalf of the Board
when they had not even read the report. He feels the Executive Committee needs
to get heavy handed with Board members.
Chair Pro Tem Menten requested Paula to provide some of the guidelines pertaining
to the Committees and structure and to provide ideas on how to shorten the
meetings. Paula respectfully commented that we have had professionals in to talk
to Board members about meeting effectiveness and some of the Board members did
not like what they had to say. The answer on effective meetings is in best
practices and doing some of what Director Anderson noted such as meeting

preparation and limiting questions to items of relevancy. She will work on
preparing such guidelines on meetings structure.
IGM Genova commented on the State audit and issues of confidentiality. He noted
these issues with bus operators had been addressed. He has requested AGM Abel
to provide him with a complete analysis on this issue.
IGM Genova noted it would be simple to combine the FasTracks into the P&D
meeting; however, staff has been criticized for not bringing information or updates
to the Board prior to an action item. There are many nuances to address and often
they are walking a tightrope between the contrasting request of Board members or
even the timeliness of when information is presented. All of this needs to be in
balance. Director Hoy noted that sometimes the problem is not the staff but the
Board.
Chair Sisk commented on 4 items:
o Pertaining to Government Relations, Committee Chair Folska had approached
him early about wanting monthly meetings; he agrees that monthly meetings
may not be needed.
o As of the first week in January, 2016, the FasTracks and P&D committee
will be combined.
o We have received a date for the opening of the University of Colorado-A
Line. That will be April 22. IGM Genova indicated he is receiving a number
of inquiries about this. Staff would like to take a disciplined approach and
do a press release this afternoon with quotes from the Chair and IGM. As
part of his protocol, he extended a courtesy call to FTA (Linda Gerske) and
the FRA advising them of this date.
o Secretary Fox will be participating in this Transportation Matters Summit;
Secretary Fox has requested a closed meeting with RTD to look at our WIN
program. He has made a unilateral decision that the two RTD Board
members attending will be Director Walker and Solano, Chair and Vice-Chair
of the Civil Rights Committee.

Public Participation
Chair Sisk reminded the speakers they would have three minutes to address the Board and
asked that they be respectful of their fellow participants.
 Nancy Rider shared that she is the Deputy Director of Homeless Services and also
appointed by Mayor Hancock on a Commission on Homelessness. She is here to
talk about the proposed rate hikes and elimination of certain bus routes. She
expressed concern that the fare increase will hurt many Downtown businesses.
Most employees at hotels, restaurants, and retail stores in Downtown use RTD
transportation. She believes these people will have a difficult times getting to work
with the rate increase. She also expressed concern that businesses will have a
difficult time attracting workers. She said businesses need the rates to remain the
same so they can attract employees.
 Doug Gragg, Denver, said he was going to repeat his trivial complaint from last
month. He stated the trees are still dead at the Union Station Light Rail platform
and there are even lights shining on them that emphasize they are dead. He asked
that something be done before it becomes winter.
 David Cook, Senior TDM Program Manager from University of Colorado (CU),
Boulder, said he was here this evening speaking at the request of CU President
Bruce Benson and three CU campuses that participate in the EcoPass program. He
stated that the CU would like to thank RTD for being tremendous partners. CU and

RTD have worked together constructively on many initiatives including the US 36
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), rail lines through the Anschutz campus, and branding of
the A-Line to DIA. CU appreciates the partnership forged with RTD over the past
several years. He wants to share CU’s concerns with the Board. CU believes there
is a more constructive way to address the Title VI concerns than increasing the
Business EcoPasses by 18.3%. The fix that RTD staff is proposing will not reduce
the cost of transportation for Title VI populations or increase access to
transportation. It will increase the cost of the EcoPass program from RTD’s 1700+
partners in the business community. If a company requires employees to contribute
to their EcoPasses, it will increase the amount those individuals have to pay. The
likely result will be a net reduction in access to discounted passes for Title VI
populations as many businesses will be priced out of the program. He stated this
fare increase is also contrary to Board policy on EcoPass pricing from 2009;
therefore CU requests that the RTD Board either tables this proposal to put in place
a timeline and process for stakeholder engagement on the EcoPass pricing or adopt
alternative three. He stated in either case the University of Colorado is committed
to working with RTD on creating a good process and finding solutions to the Title
VI issues.
George Gerstle, Boulder County Transportation Director, wanted to highlight
Boulder’s concerns that were outlined in a letter from the Boulder County
Commissioners that is available in the Board Office. The concerns are as follows:
o There has been no meaningful opportunity for public input to the fare
change, which affects over a hundred thousand RTD Riders and thousands
of businesses
o They do not understand the analytical approach used to justify the proposed
fare increase
o They are confused how making the EcoPass program more expensive, and
therefore less likely to be taken advantage of by Title VI populations, is
consistent with the goals of Title VI
George Gerstle stated that Boulder would like to have time to discuss any EcoPass
price recommendations collaboratively with RTD. He encouraged the Board to
choose alternative three so there would be time to have a collaborative effort to
understand how to best move forward.
Scott McCarey, Boulder County Alternative Transportation Coordinator, shared that
he spoke with the FTA and Boulder County’s legal counsel regarding RTD’s Title VI
concerns. In speaking with FTA staff he learned FTA does not review RTD’s fare
policies to determine if there is a Title VI violation. The FTA requires RTD to have a
fare equity policy and fare equity analysis but they do not make any determinations
of whether or not RTD has violated Title VI. He said it is possible for a third party
to make a claim that there is a Title VI violation but RTD cannot be sued for
disparate impacts. A third party can only submit an administrative claim to FTA.

He explained that what happens is the FTA will contact RTD to work through any
claims with RTD. The FTA would ask RTD to defend RTD’s fare policies to
determine if the claim is valid. If the FTA determined that there was a Title VI
violation, the next step would be to require RTD to move towards mitigating
measures, which in the case of the EcoPass could be in a variety of ways. He said
that if RTD refused to take any mitigating measures the FTA could begin
proceedings to withhold federal funds but it would require the FTA to issue a report
with the Transportation Infrastructure Committee of the House of Representatives
and the Banking and Housing of Urban Affairs Committee of the Senate.
Additionally, any withholdings would have to be approved by the Secretary of
Transportation of the United States. He pointed out that this is a long process so
he believes there would be time to work through any potential claim with the FTA.
Scott McCarey shared that he reviewed the administrative claims that had been
made with the FTA and only a few were related to disparate impacts. There were
no administrative claims based solely on fare structure and only one successful
claim involving the Bay Area Rapid Transit; however, as far as Scott McCarey can
tell this claim was eventually worked out at the administrative level. Scott
McCarey stated that the message is that RTD has a lot of time before federal funds
would be withheld.
Scott McCary noted that the EcoPass concerns have nothing to do with the 2016
price increase but the underlying price structure, which has been in place for over
20 years. He pointed out there has been no administrative claim to this point. He
is concerned this additional fare increase is moving forward too quickly. He
emphasized that Boulder supports a 13.3% increase but asked that they approve
alternative three.
Daniela Villareal is a community organizer with Rights for All People. She is here
because she is trying to push forward a pass program that would be more inclusive.
Everyone she talks to is supportive of an income based pass. She stated that many
people cannot afford RTD’s current prices. She encouraged the Board to consider
this in the future.
Gina McAfee, 36 Commuting Solutions, stated she came to the meeting to talk
about the proposed EcoPass pricing. 36 Community Solutions is a Transportation
Management Organization. One of the reasons her organization was formed was to
be a mechanism for assisting the region with its air quality goals. EcoPasses are an
extremely important tool they use to work with the private sector members in
achieving that goal. She believes with such a substantial price increase it will be
much more difficult to use EcoPasses as a tool. She stated that 36 Commuting
Solutions is concerned that RTD is not complying with its 2009 Board Policy
regarding EcoPass fare increases. They feel there was a lack of public involvement
and do not understand why this is being rushed. She said 36 Commuting Solutions

is perplexed as to how increasing the price of EcoPasses could address concerns
about Title VI. She encouraged the Board to vote on alternative three.
Todd Kilburn, Naropa University Chief Financial Officer, thanked the Board for the
opportunity to speak. He wanted to raise Naropa’s concern about the increase in
the pricing structure for the EcoPasses. As a university they provide passes to all
full-time employees and students. He is concerned this increase will create some
real challenges for Naropa to continue to provide the EcoPasses to their employees.
He encouraged the Board to consider alternative three and to consider the impact
this increase will have on a University.
Karen Benker shared that she is a former RTD Director and served on the Longmont
City Council. She is a founding member of Citizens for Completing FasTracks. The
goal of Citizens for Completing FasTracks is to bring rail to Boulder County. They
have been meeting with City Council members, Mayors, interested citizens, etc. to
talk about how there not one mile of rail is planned for Boulder County until after
2040. Citizens for Completing FasTracks has several requests: (1) establish a
Northwest Rail Corridor Fund and set aside any excess revenue, (2) do not build or
authorize any projects outside of FasTracks until FasTracks is completed, and (3)
build the Northwest Rail in segments and start now. She stated that Boulder
County has paid $144 million into FasTracks projects. She suggested RTD look at
using money from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account, review RTD’s
conservative Sales and Use Tax estimates and use any surplus in our operating
budget. She asked the Board to think of Citizens for Finishing FasTracks as RTD’s
allies, not adversaries, as they want to help RTD build the line.
Joan Peck, Longmont City Council Candidate and Co-founder of Citizens for
Finishing FasTracks, explained that she was running on two issues: finishing
FasTracks and giving the people of Longmont a voice on the issue of fracking. She
said that when her community voted to become part of the District, they did so
with the expectation that RTD would fulfill its promise and build the Northwest Rail
by 2017. She noted that Boulder is growing and gaining more places of
employment. If two anti-growth initiatives Boulder is considering pass, employees
will live in surrounding communities and need transportation. Citizens are
concerned that they have paid over $140 million in taxes. She said that Citizens
for Finishing FasTracks would like to work with RTD to get the rail built. She
believes the proposed enhanced bus service on US 287 is a very poor substitute
and vision for a county that should be a leader in transit. She asked the Board to
put the ‘R’ back in RTD.
Maggie Gómez, 9 to 5 Community Organizer, stated that the majority of RTD riders
who are seeing a fare increase in 2016 are low income. She is very excited about
the RTD Board and staff seriously considering an income based pass. There has
been a lot of discussion regarding funding for this program and the low income
communities are concerned. She believes that low income riders are already

implicitly subsidizing higher income riders. An example of this is the free parking
provided that low income riders will never use. 9 to 5 wants to make sure the
Board follows through on its commitment to low income riders by implementing an
income based pass.
Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, 9 to 5, stated that in 2016 a lot of low income riders will be
suffering the high costs of RTD. She expressed concern about this because many
of the passes for higher income riders are being subsidized by low income riders.
RTD’s primary funding source is Sales and Use Tax. She noted that sales tax takes
a bigger share of a low income household’s total income when compared with
higher income households. She is excited there are Board members who are
supportive of an income based pass; however, the Board is concerned with funds.
She said it is a matter of prioritizing. RTD contributed $17 million for the Crawford
Hotel while an income based pass program would cost $11 to $12 million. She
does not believe the funds should come from non-profits. RTD is a public service
and the funds should come from RTD.
Will Toor, Transportation Program Director for Southwest Energy Efficiency Project,
thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak. He said, as others have pointed
out, there was little opportunity for participation in the development of the EcoPass
proposal. Given the fact that the fundamental structure has been in place for 20
years, and that in 2009 there was a commitment made not to alter EcoPass pricing
without SmartCard data, he urged the Board to form an inclusive task force to
explore EcoPass issues in a collaborative fashion. He suggested there are other
approaches staff could take when evaluating if there is a Title VI issue with
EcoPasses. An alternative approach could be to evaluate the subsidy per boarding
for EcoPass riders compared to the system as a whole. He encouraged staff to
perform such an analysis in a transparent fashion that can be shared with
stakeholders. He noted that nothing in the proposed action this evening would
benefit any minority or low income populations. He asked RTD to consider
expanding the EcoPass program.
Yolanda Begay said she is a full-time college student at Metro and an intern with 9
to 5 as well as a single mother. She appreciates RTD as it gets her around but
acknowledged there are going to be cuts in the bus service next year. She asked
how she would get around when this happens. She also hopes RTD will consider
an income passed pass. She has heard RTD employees speak distastefully about
the homeless. These people are already in a bad spot and RTD should be helping
them, not speaking poorly of them. She said that the Board is not listening and
forgetting RTD’s true purpose. She asked the Board to consider an income based
pass as well as not cutting any bus lines.
Debra Burns stated that last time she spoke before the Board she was homeless.
She lives in affordable housing now but she is waiting for social security. While
she waits she gets $189 to pay rent, buy groceries, etc. She does not understand

RTD raising fares just because it needs more money. She also does not understand
why people have to keep coming to the meetings to speak about this when the
Board already knows the problem. She said it should not be that hard to fix the
problem.
Dace West, Mile High Connects, noted that her organization has been working on
fare affordability issues for about the last year and a half. Tonight she would like
to talk about the broader mission of Mile High Connects. She said that while the
focus has been on an income based pass, Mile High Connects overall mission is
simply affordable transportation options. She believes there is a real opportunity to
be creative and use Business and Neighborhood EcoPasses to address affordability
and accessibility and encouraged further discussion about this idea.
Judy Grosswiler, Boulder, was here on behalf of Gary Brenner, her Neighborhood
EcoPass Coordinator, who was unable to attend, and herself. She said that overall
RTD has been a very responsive partner. She believes that the Board is probably
confused by how many Neighborhood EcoPass program volunteers are so incensed
about the proposed rate increase the Board is about to adopt. She thinks the Board
likely feels there is nothing wrong with the process followed as the neighborhoods
are only being asked to pay the same fare increase that was proposed for the
general ridership; however, they are hoping the Board can do better. It is easy to
fall into the habit of thinking you have all the information when you do not. She
stated that the process of evaluating the EcoPasses has been flawed in ways that
have become discouragingly common. She pointed out that in her area there are
20 apartment buildings predominantly occupied by low income residents. She
noted that RTD staff said there was not a need for public comment because
EcoPasses are not available for the general public. She believes RTD only conducts
hearings only when it is compelled to do so.
Dave Turnquist, Chair of the Campus TMA, is here representing the Anschutz
Medical Campus, Children’s Hospital, University Hospital and Veterans’
Administration Hospital. He believes what he is asking for is a little different than
everyone else. He is not saying do not implement a price increase but asked that
the price increase implementation be delayed. This would allow time to collect
accurate data through SmartCards so RTD could be more transparent with the
calculations. He noted that independent reviews of the calculation methodology
have shown the rate increase should be around 11% as opposed to 18%. He
stated that from a University standpoint it will cost an additional $47,000 annually.
Debra Baskett, Transportation Manager for Broomfield, is here tonight to represent
the US 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition (MCC). She said that the MCC is
bigger than the Board might think. It represents Adams County, Boulder County,
City and County of Broomfield, Lafayette, Longmont, Louisville, Westminster,
Jefferson County, Erie and Superior. She apologized on behalf of Mayor Muckle
who planned to attend but was called away for another matter. She shared that on

Bike to Work Day she volunteered to be an ambassador at Broomfield Bus Rapid
Transit Station to let people know what they could expect. She said the only thing
people wanted to talk about is if their EcoPass would be affected. She believes one
of the ways to ensure that US 36 BRT is a success is to let EcoPass be one of the
tools that make it great. MCC asks the Board to support alternative three.
John Tayer, President of the Boulder Chamber of Commerce and former RTD Board
Member, had several comments regarding the EcoPass. He recognized that the
EcoPass is so important to businesses in the Boulder community. There are traffic
jams coming into Boulder every day that illustrate how businesses need an
alternative. He believes the EcoPass combined the US 36 BRT is a recipe for
success to drive drivers from single occupancy vehicles to public transit. He
understands that RTD is addressing the economics of the entire fare structure and it
is a challenge; however, it will also be a challenge for businesses to adopt an 18%
increase this late in the budgeting cycle. He is concerned many will make the
difficult decision not to purchase EcoPasses. He shared that as an RTD Board
Member he has the opportunity to participate in the EcoPass Task Force in 2009.
He urged the Board to settle on a 13% EcoPass increase and then work together to
address the other challenges. EcoPasses are a benefit to businesses and a benefit
to RTD in increasing transit use. He hopes we can continue our history of working
together.
Kathleen Bracke, Go Boulder Manager, was here to speak on behalf of Mayor
Applebaum who was unable to attend. Mayor Applebaum’s comments have also
been endorsed by Boulder’s Transportation Advisory Board as well as many
partners and neighborhoods. She echoed the comments and concerns of her
community members and regional partners. She said everyone is very concerned
about the proposed increase in the EcoPass Fare Structure. She encouraged the
Board to offer more time to work together on the increase. She stated that the
EcoPass process has been too short. She asked the Board to support alternative
three. Alternative three aligns with the general fare increase and allow for a task
force to come up with a solution and addresses the goals of the community and
those of Title VI. She requested that the Board help work with the community on a
collaborative basis going forward so more people can have more access to transit
at all income levels.
Rick McClintock, Denver, recognized that the Board is faced with a number of
critical questions as they consider the EcoPass increase. While there have been
repeated efforts to get EcoPass data by the public, he said this was the first
opportunity for public comment since the data was shared. He wondered how
CH2M Hill came up with their ridership data when the public has been waiting for
tap data from SmartCards for years. He is concerned that CH2M Hill is not using
accurate ridership information. He inquired how the cost per ride can be
determined when you do not know how many trips are actually taken. He

expressed concern over the minimum number of employees requires as part of an
EcoPass contract. He believes this is disencentivising small businesses that hire
low income workers. He reminded the Board that this is an innovative program that
is known to spur ridership and give RTD $20 million per year in secured revenue.
He thinks this increase might put that revenue in jeopardy. He hopes the Board will
only pass a 13% increase.
Karen Werninghaus, eGo Car Share, has been in a unique position where her
organization received an outside grant to work with the Globeville and Mariposa
communities to try to get Nighborhood EcoPasses. She stated that there have been
many challenges, despite having extensive experience with Neighborhood
EcoPasses in other communities. She explained that in Globeville households were
assessed at a rate of $424 per household, which is 4 times higher than a mobile
home park she works with in Boulder. This was so cost prohibitive that the
program could not even get started. She believes there are some really deep
inequality concerns with the current pricing. She feels that RTD needs to slow
down and take a look at the underlying issues. She thinks if there was accurate
data many of the concerns could be addressed in an open manner. She encouraged
the Board to make getting and validating data a priority.

as there is no Board policy. He also learned that the
FTA does not have a spare ratio policy for rail as rail
transit operations tend to be highly individualized. He
said based on this information he would like to
postpone this action to the next Board meeting. This
would allow the Board to establish a Board policy based
on complete insight and education for the Board to
make a quality determination to create a strong rational
underlying the spare ratio policy.

Director Lasater made the motion to postpone the
approval of the purchase of seventeen light rail vehicles
until the October 27, 2015 Board Meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Walker said he does not remember it being
stated that there was a Board policy. He noted an
industry standard of 20% spare ratio referenced in the
Board Report, but that is different than a Board policy.
He stated that he would not be supporting this
amendment. He thinks it is appropriate to have some
level of back-up trains. He often notices that it is
standing room only on our trains, especially during rush
hour. He said he has talked to the people that clean
the trains and heard about the problems they have in
making sure the trains are ready in the morning.
Director Walker believes we need more trains.
Director Bagley thinks the big issue is determining the
best practices at different transit agencies. In his

Motion:

research he has found it to be from the mid-teens to
low twenties. He believes it is up to RTD as a transit
agency to define an appropriate spare ratio, which staff
has done. He said the Board needs to move forward
tonight with the main motion.
Director Lubow believes that the spare ratio needs to
be dictated by staff’s own experiences. She asked if
they could indicate what they think the spare ratio
should be. Interim General Manager Genova explained
that RTD develops a fleet management plan that is
submitted to the FTA. In the last revision the analysis
indicated that a 20% spare ratio is recommended.
Director Folska inquired about the life expectancy of a
rail car. She thinks RTD’s first priority is safety for our
riders and keeping the vehicles in a state of good repair
is critical to that. Interim General Manager Genova said
the average useful life is about 30 years. He noted that
on the bus side RTD has been very successful in
extending the useful life so hopefully we can do the
same thing with the rail vehicles. Director Folska
stated she supports buying the new vehicles to be on
the safe side.
Director Archuleta wondered how many miles the old
trains have and when they were acquired. He also
asked how the new trains compare to the older
vehicles. Interim General Manager Genova said the
trains were purchased in 1994 and have over 1.3
million miles. He explained that the trains need to be
compatible for interlining so they will be very similar.
The older vehicles have had various updates over the
years that the new vehicles will automatically arrive
with.
Director James feels a Board policy falls into the realms
of micromanagement. He is happy to accept staff’s
recommendation.

Director Francone inquired if the chart outlining the
maintenance spare ratio was before or after the
purchase of the new vehicles. Interim General Manager
Genova said that illustrated the spare ratio if the
additional vehicles were purchased.
Director Lasater said he has an extreme issue with the
difficulty facing the Board tonight. Staff has presented
two issues that they say need to be approved without
giving the Board time to do any due diligence. He
questions the calculations that have been used to
determine the spare ratio and if they are actually
needed now and not sometime in the future. He is
concerned that this action leaves vehicles sitting on the
sidelines most of the time. This would give RTD 32
spares at a value of $132 million, which is almost
enough to build one of the extensions. Having too
many spares ties up a great deal of funding that could
be used elsewhere. He asked the Board to delay this
for a month so staff could provide better information at
a study session.

Recommended EcoPass Pricing for 2016

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors approves an 18.3 percent price increase for Business EcoPass and a 13.3
percent price increase for Neighborhood EcoPass. These price increases are for 2016
contracts. In addition, it is recommended that the current $2.50 DIA surcharge be
eliminated for both the Business EcoPass and Neighborhood EcoPass programs.
Prior to the Board having the opportunity to move the recommended action made by staff,
Chair Sisk made a motion to approve a Substitute Main Motion.
Motion to
Approve
Substitute
Main Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to approve a Substitute
Main Motion which reads:

“Adopt the 13.3% price increase for both Business and Neighborhood
EcoPasses for the 2016 contract, eliminating the current $2.50 DIA
surcharge from both the Business and Neighborhood EcoPass. In addition
thereto RTD form a working group with stakeholders immediately to
ascertain the basis for any increase. As part of the working group, there will

Packet Pg. 87

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Sep 15, 2015 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of September 15, 2015)

9.A

be a full and complete analysis of the Title VI to ensure substantial
compliance therewith. Any report from the staff and working group will be
presented to the RTD Board no later than September 1, 2016, for
implementation in the 2017 calendar year.”
Director Bagley seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Folska stated she would not support the
Substitute Main Motion as she supports staff’s
recommendation.
Director Francone asked if the Substitute Main Motion
could be read again. Chair Sisk explained that it was
Alternative Three with an additional proviso. It read:

“Adopt Alternative Three with an additional proviso that RTD form a working
group with stakeholders immediately to ascertain the basis for any increase.
As part of the working group, there will be a full and complete analysis of
the Title VI to ensure substantial compliance therewith. Any report from the
staff and working group will be presented to the RTD Board no later than
September 1, 2016, for implementation in the 2017 calendar year.”
Director Francone inquired as to who would comprise
the working group. Chair Sisk indicated that would be
set up by staff similar to what was established in
2009.
Director Deadwyler supports some aspect of the
Substitute Main Motion, like setting up a working
group, but does not believe the Board should approve
postponing an increase until 2017. She recognized that
it was very hard to talk to the general public about a
rate increase in January of 2016 but the Board passed
it anyway. She feels changing direction for the
businesses will not sit well with the constituents when
the Board did not afford them the same consideration.
She said she would be voting no on the Substitute Main
Motion. Chair Sisk made a point of clarification that
there would still be a 13.3% increase.

Director Lubow shared that she has thought long and
hard about this because it is a very complex issue. She
expressed concern that the staff recommendation will
be potentially destructive to the EcoPass program,
which Director Lubow believes is a successful program.
It seems clear to her that it would be nice if there were
more low income people in the program and hopes that
can happen in the future. She is concerned that a task
force designed to look at EcoPasses will not be
inclusive of low income people and the Affordable Fare
Task Force. She suggested that the task force for
EcoPasses be more inclusive.
Director Bagley noted that there was tremendous
discussion about the EcoPasses during the Committee
meeting. He recommended Alternative 2 at that time.
He said it is apparent that staff provided a range of
alternatives as part of their recommendation which they
do not normally do. He understands that staff has Title
VI concerns but believes those could be worked on
over the next year. He does not believe staff would
have provided alternatives if they thought Title VI was
going to blow everything out of the tub. Interim
General Manager Genova stated that staff definitely
thinks it is very prudent for the Board to be thinking
about Title VI. He noted that staff typically provides at
least one alternative in every Board Report. Interim
General Manager Genova pointed out that while there
are alternatives, those alternatives also state that they
are not recommended by staff. He stressed that staff
would not be proposing an 18.3% Business EcoPass
fare increase if they did not think there was a Title VI
issue.
Director Walker stated that he will not be supporting
the Substitute Main Motion for many of the same
reasons expressed by Director Deadwyler. He is very
concerned about RTD’s exposure should there be a
Title VI complaint. He said it is one thing to have an
issue that the Board is unaware of, but to knowingly
continue that after the issue has been discovered is an

Packet Pg. 89

9.A

affront to RTD’s mission. He commented that there are
options outside of the EcoPass for companies to offer
transportation as a benefit to their employees;
however, he hopes most companies still see the value.
Director Tobiassen concurs with Directors Deadwyler
and Walker. He said that, quite frankly, he has not
received one comment regarding the EcoPass increase
from his District but he does hear from people every
day that struggle to pay the full fare. He does not
believe RTD can ignore Title VI. It needs to be a
priority that everyone is treated fairly. He has a
problem passing off Title VI issues lightly because the
FTA does not really enforce it. The canary is in the
tunnel and the tunnel is Title VI; the canary is having a
hard time breathing right now. He noted that the Board
has tough choices to make, especially raising fare and
impacting the low income community, and he would be
supporting staff’s recommendation.
Director James thinks the lesson learned from this
might be to have more incremental fare increases.
Chair Sisk stated that he respects the difficult work
staff has done in evaluating EcoPasses. He regrets that
there is any reference to the fact that RTD is pitting
EcoPasses against an income based fare as those need
to be considered separately. He said when the time
comes to approve an income based fare he will support
it. He does not think RTD has given stakeholders
enough time to participate with RTD in a collaborative
process. He recognizes that Title VI is important but
was hoping to move toward compliance with Title VI
while making an informed decision. He said it is clear
to him how the vote would go but reiterated that RTD
owes it to the stakeholders to continue the process
going forward.
Director Folska recognized how hard staff has worked
during this process. They have been under the gun and
had a lot of pressure placed on them. She said this

Packet Pg. 90

9.A

action is really about equity and fairness. To not vote
to raise EcoPass pricing is unconscionable in her mind.
She shared that she has many friends who are
employees at CU Boulder, CU Denver, and Anschutz.
She asked one friend how much she pays per month
and it was only $25. Director Folska asked her how
much she would be willing to pay and she said $50,
which is a 100% increase, not 18%. She spoke to
another gentleman who said he paid nothing but would
be willing to pay a lot more than nothing. She believes
if it is hard for some employers to cover the increase
perhaps they can ask their employees to contribute.
Director Francone asked if it was RTD’s legal counsel’s
opinion that a 13.3% increase would satisfy any Title
VI inequities. Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained
that CH2M Hill’s fare equity analysis indicated that
without an 18.3% increase Business EcoPasses users
would be receiving a greater subsidy per boarding when
compared to low income or minority riders as a whole.
If an 18.3% increase is not passed RTD would be
required to file a report that RTD is not in compliance
with Title VI.
Director Francone asked Chair Sisk when the 13.3%
increase would go into effect as part of his motion. He
stated January 1, 2016.
Director Francone wondered how staff determines
whether people are high income, low income,
minorities, etc. Marla Lien explained that the
information is gathered as part of RTD’s customer
surveys.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Hoy called for the question.
Director Francone indicated that she would be inclined
to vote yes with assurances from staff that there will
be continuing study on the pricing with SmartCard
Data. Interim General Manager Genova stated that
would happen.
Director Menten noted that overall the EcoPasses are
still a great deal for businesses. If a company has 15
employees, to buy an EcoPass for each employee will
cost just under $1500 total, which is a great deal.
Also, if a company has 100 employees it would cost
just $85 per year, per employee, for an EcoPass;
however, she pointed out that there can be large

increases for companies that move from one price level
to another just by adding one employee. She hopes
that can be addressed. She recognized that with
current RTD pricing the taxpayers are heavily
subsidizing RTD but many do not use our services. She
said the only right thing for her to do is to vote for the
EcoPass fare increases.
Director Tobiassen believes that stakeholder
participation is still an important step in the process but
it needs to be more inclusive than just the businesses
that participate in EcoPasses.
Director Solano stated that he will be voting no. He
thinks an 18.3% increase for businesses would be fine
but his community is pushed to the max. They cannot
afford another fare increase.

CEO

Date: October 14, 2015

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 13, 2015

Board Meeting Date: October 27, 2015

Subject:

January 2016 Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the January 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A
resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $870,350 and, further, to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, adjustments to schedules and several service reductions. These proposals are offered in
parallel with the Board approved US 36 BRT Service Plan and would be implemented on the same date.
We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose
adjustments as appropriate in future service change recommendation.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Three public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between October
16th and October 19th. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized
in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total base system financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $870,350
annualized. An estimated $139,750 of the total cost impact is grant funded and sponsored by Boulder
County. Net Cost $730,600.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed January 2016 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

A LOOK AHEAD – Spring 2016
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
 A and R Lines Rail and Bus Service Plan (East and I-225 Corridor)
 Grant funded peak period service increase on the Free MetroRide

Route 3 – Alameda Avenue
This proposal discontinues the deviation into the Havana & Alameda Park-n-Ride.
Passengers may instead use stops on Alameda, approximately 300 feet away. Saves 3-4
minutes in each direction for through passengers. It is also proposed to provide more direct
routing through Cherry Creek by operating on Adams Street instead of Madison Street
between Bayaud Avenue and Ellsworth, instead of the indirect routing via Ellsworth,
Madison, and Bayaud. This routing provides convenient access for neighborhood
residents, as well as more direct and faster service for through passengers. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited
Schedule adjustments. No cost impacts are anticipated
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron
It is proposed to extend this route to 144th and Huron at 60 min frequency, all day in
order to provide fixed route service to the Orchards Mall development. In addition, it is
proposed to remove the current ‘selected trips’ from the 124thand Peoria loop and to
operate all trips after Wagon Road Park-n-Ride on Huron. Trips would no longer enter the
Park-n-Ride, but provide connections on-street at Huron and 120th Avenue. Cost impacts
anticipated to be an estimated $165,000 annualized.
Route 10- 12th Avenue
It is proposed to reroute eastbound trips to operate on Wazee Street between 15th and
17th streets, and on 17th Street between Wazee and Market streets. Service would be
discontinued on Wazee Street west of 15th Street, on 14th Street and Market Street. No
cost impacts are anticipated with this proposal.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
Discontinue deviation via Cherry Street and Cherry Creek Drive South, north of Mississippi
in Glendale. Most passengers boardings are within 500 feet of Mississippi, others may
use Route 46. Saves approximately 3 minutes in each direction for through passengers.
Reroute via Blackhawk Street instead of Abilene between Mississippi and Exposition
Avenues in Aurora. More conveniently serves the overall residential and commercial
development in this area.
Route 15 – East Colfax
New recovery location at 11th/Larimer requires revision to the exit from the Auraria
Campus. New routing will be 11th Street, R-Auraria Pkwy, C-Market St, R-17th St, to
regular route. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 16 – West Colfax
It is proposed to discontinue evening and late night short-turn trips between Civic Center
Station and Decatur-Federal Station. Anticipated cost savings is estimated to be $63,000
annualized.

Route 79Ltd – South Quebec Way Limited, becomes Route 83D
Rename Route 79L as Route 83D, and fully integrate schedule with Route 83L.

Packet Pg. 102

The following changes are designed to extend the period of 15 minute frequency along
Leetsdale and through Cherry Creek by one hour at the end of the AM peak, and by one
hour eastbound at the beginning of the PM peak.
- Convert existing westbound Route 83L trip at 8:39am to a Route 83D (79L) trip.
- Add late AM peak westbound trips from Nine Mile Station at 9:09am and 9:39am.
- Add new midafternoon eastbound trips from Civic Center Station at 1:16pm and
1:46pm.
With these additions the 15 minute trunk frequency on Leetsdale/1st/Speer would then
operate until 10:45am westbound arriving Civic Center Station, and would begin at
1:00pm eastbound departing Civic Center Station. Current Route 83L midday productivity
is 65.0 boardings/hour. .
On Saturdays during the period of 15 minute frequency on Route 83L, approximately
10:00am to 6:00pm, reroute one trip per hour as Route 83D, providing Saturday service
along South Quebec Way and South Dayton. Cost impacts are anticipated to be an
estimated $60,000 annualized.
Route 83L – Parker/Leetsdale
Add 7:40am westbound trip on Saturday/Sunday/holidays, relieving overloads on existing
7:25am westbound trip. Cost impacts are anticipated to be an estimated $6,000
annualized.
Route 92 – 92nd Ave Crosstown
Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 100 – Kipling Street
Weekday minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No
cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 104X – Commerce City/Denver Express
Grant funding for this route expires as of January 16, 2016. It is proposed to incorporate
this route into the regular RTD services since ridership warrants its continuation, as per
RTD Service Standards. Hourly ridership for this service averages 24 passengers per inservice hour. However, the last trip in the northbound direction averages 5 passengers per
trip and so it is recommended that this trip be discontinued. Cost impacts are estimated to
be $140,700 annualized.
Route 120 – 120th Avenue/Brighton
This proposal extends the 7:05am westbound from Wagon Road pnR trip further east to
Prairie Center Parkway/27th Avenue to balance passenger loads between existing
westbound trips. Cost impacts are estimated to be $10,400 annualized.

Route 205 - 28th Street /Gunbarrel/Heatherwood
Schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 206 – Pearl/ Manhattan/Fairview High School
Discontinue the route segment between Boulder Junction at Depot Square (BJDS) and
Boulder Transit Center due to low ridership averaging 8 passengers per service hour or
1.5 passengers per trip and duplicative service provided by Routes 205 and HOP.
Increase the frequency between BJDS and Flatiron Business Park to 15 minutes in the
peaks with a timed connection with Route BJCC. Boulder Junction at Depot Square will
be the new western terminal for this route. This is part of the recently revised Boulder
Transportation Master Plan. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 225 – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US 287
Schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 323 – Skyline Crosstown
Due to the reconstruction and re-opening of Twin Peaks Mall, it is proposed to adjust
Route 323 to serve the location along Hover, between Nelson Rd and Diagonal Highway
119, similar to its former routing. This would result in the discontinuation of routing along
Diagonal Highway 119 between Hover and Nelson Rd, as well as along Nelson Rd
between Diagonal Highway 119 and Hover. This re-route comes at the request of the City
of Longmont in order for the route to better serve the reconstructed Mall directly. Average
daily Ridership affected: 26 passenger or 2 passengers per trip. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Route AB – Boulder/Denver Airport (DIA)
Add one AM eastbound trip at 5:30am to address current overloads. Anticipated cost is
estimated to be $23,000 annualized.

for better on-time performance and balanced layover/recovery.

Route GS – Golden/Boulder
Schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route J – Longmont/Gunbarrel/Boulder
It is proposed to discontinue route J south of Euclid/18th Street due to ridership on this
segment of the route averaging 15 boardings per day and duplication of local service via
Routes DASH, SKIP and 204. It is also proposed to discontinue the current 6:03pm
northbound trip due to ridership averaging only 9 passengers. Cost savings are estimated
to be $11,000 annualized.
Route L – Longmont/Denver
Boulder County and City of Longmont have been awarded grant funding for additional
weekday mid-day service, as well as Saturday service and new Sunday/Holiday service. It
is proposed to increase the weekday mid-day service to hourly frequency and extend the
service span to 10pm, northbound. In addition, Saturday hourly service frequency span is
proposed to be extended from approximately 9am to 10pm and Sunday hourly service
frequency to be added from 9am to 10pm, matching Saturday service levels and
frequency. The anticipated cost impact is $140,000 annualized funded through a CMAQ
grant sponsored by Boulder County.
Route N – Nederland Boulder
Schedule adjustments are proposed. No cost impacts are anticipated.

Light Rail
E Line
It is proposed to add one train in the operations (total of seven trains) to complete the transition
to a full 15-minute headway in the AM and PM peak periods. Southbound trips from Denver
Union Station would be added at 6:58 AM, 8:13 AM, 3:58 PM, 5:28 PM, and 5:58 PM.
Northbound trips from Lincoln Station would be added at 6:24 AM, 7:54 AM, 3:39 PM, and 4:39
PM. This increase in service will help with transfers to/from the new Flatiron Flyer and new
commuter rail lines opening later in the year in addition to transfers to/from existing routes such
as the W Line. Additionally, it helps increase capacity on RTD’s fastest-growing light rail line
(11% ridership increase between 2013-2014) and provides an alternative service to the F Line
and H Line, the latter which is near capacity during the peak hour. Additionally, it is proposed to

12.A.a

W Line
It is proposed to adjust times slightly to space trains better at Denver Union Station (most
westbound trains would depart one minute earlier) and adjust the time by about one minute for
eastbound trains arriving at Auraria West Station. No cost impacts anticipated.

Call-nRide
Golden Call-n-Ride
The Golden Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
under a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by the
City of Golden, the Colorado School of Mines and the RTD. The RTD contributes 50% of
the local match contributed towards the grant. The Call-n-Ride operates one vehicle as a
Flex Route and two vehicles as a non-flex route Call-n-Ride on weekdays. The Call-n-Ride
operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 7:00pm. On
Saturday, the Call-n-Ride operates one vehicle as a Call-n-Ride. This recommendation is to
add an additional 3.5 hours service on the weekday service. Weekday service is currently
at 7.4 boardings per hour. This additional service will provide additional am service to the
Call-n-Ride to meet customer’s service demand. Cost impact is anticipated to be an
estimated $28,789 annualized.

Attachment: Atch A January 2016 Service Change revised (2550 : January 2016 Service Plan)

adjust evening trips (between 6-8 PM) by 15 minutes southbound from Denver Union Station to
create a more balanced schedule along with the C Line, similar to the midday schedule.
Total hours required: 9:23 hours daily (Mondays-Thursdays and Fridays), 2,391 annual hours.
Cost impacts are anticipated to be approximately $283,000 annualized.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: October 27, 2015

Subject:

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active
duty members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of
December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will
have minimal impact on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution
allowing active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006.
This offer has been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December
31, 2015. As a result of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,
Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special
services such as SkyRide and BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel
must either be in uniform or present an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date
of December 31, 2015 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited
again next year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States
Military.

Recommended Changes to the
Agency Reduced Fare Program

Non-Profit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that RTD staff be authorized to
make changes to the RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program as detailed in Attachment A of this
action to be implemented by January 1, 2016.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program has been in existence for more than 25 years. The
purpose of the program is to offer government agencies and nonprofit organizations the opportunity to
purchase discounted RTD fare media for distribution to their low income clients. There are currently over
240 participating agencies. Those agencies purchase approximately $5.8 million annually in RTD fare
media at a variety of reduced rates.
Many agencies currently participating in the program and agencies that have chosen not to participate in
the program have indicated that some of the program’s administrative requirements are somewhat
burdensome. Those requirements include the submittal of quarterly and annual reports and maintaining a
distribution log for each pass or ticket distributed.
DISCUSSION
In March 2015, RTD staff surveyed 360 staff members of current participating agencies to seek input
regarding desired program changes. 140 responses were received, a 39 percent response rate. Many of
the staff recommended program changes were suggested by agencies in that survey. A second survey
of the same participating agencies was conducted from September 28 through October 15. Agencies
were asked to comment on the staff proposed changes that were presented to the RTD Board at the
September 29 Study Session. Thus far, 28 responses have been received from agencies. The
recommended changes to administrative requirements received overwhelming support, as did the
simplification of discounts on monthly pass products. Several agencies did express concern over the
proposed change in the discount for 10-Ride Ticket Books from the current 60 percent to 50 percent.
After consideration of the input from the agencies, staff feels that the overall package of changes to the
program will provide a net benefit to agencies and will enable many current agencies to expand their
participation and for new agencies to join the program. The staff recommendations are contained in
Attachment A of this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
In 2014, RTD received $2.5 million in revenue from participating agencies in exchange for fare media
with a face value of $5.8 million. Staff anticipates that the demand for discounted fare media will
increase under the proposed program changes and is recommending that an annual cap of $6.8 million in
fare media face value be implemented initially until such time as the financial impact of the proposed

Packet Pg. 121

13.C

changes can be better evaluated. If the proposed $6.8 million annual cap is met, revenue to RTD would
increase to approximately $3.4 million annually.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Adopt the proposed changes to the RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program to be
implemented by January 1, 2016 with an annual cap of $6.8 million in fare media face value that
would increase program revenue to RTD to by approximately $160,000. This is the recommended
alternative.
2.

Adopt the proposed changes to the RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program as detailed in
Attachment A, but cap annual sales at the current level of $5.8 million in fare media face value.
This is not recommended because with the changes in prices of fare media associated with this
program having increased with the pending fare increase, agencies would be able to provide
fewer rides to their clients.

3.

Do not adopt the proposed changes and maintain the program with current fare media discounts
and administrative requirements. This is not recommended as staff feels the recommended
changes will improve availability of reduced fare RTD fare media for low income individuals.

APPENDIX A
RTD NON-PROFIT AGENCY REDUCED FARE PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 2016
The goal is to streamline this program and make it more affordable and accessible for customers and
more manageable for agencies.
Fundamental Program Changes
 Change the name of the program from “RTD Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program” to “RTD
Nonprofit Program”.
 Offer new Day Pass Ticket Books as another fare option for agencies.
 Offer the same 50% discount on all fare media (10-Ride Ticket Books, Day Pass Ticket Books and
all regular and discount monthly passes) and eliminate quantity restrictions previously part of
the 40% monthly pass program. Currently, there are three program components with different
discounts:
a. 60% discount on 10-Ride Ticket Books (all types, regular and discount)
b. 25% discount on monthly passes (all types, regular and discount)
c. 40% discount on monthly passes (regular local only, limit of 25)
 Permit agencies to recover up to 100% of the price paid to RTD from their clients for all fare
media. Currently this is only allowed on the 25% monthly pass component of the program and
the agency is required to have a minimum contribution of 25% of the face value of the pass.
Administrative Changes for Participating Agencies
 Eliminate quarterly and annual reports, replace with an annual agency CEO certification of
continued compliance with program policies and procedures and periodic agency audits.
 Eliminate the requirement that agencies maintain a distribution log for each pass or ticket
distributed.
 Allow the distribution from primary account holder to other partner agencies with proper
documentation.
 Permit agencies to return unused monthly passes for credit to their account.
 Limit agencies to one order per calendar month.
 Orders may be picked up by appointment or may be shipped at agency’s expense.
 Implement cap of $575,000 per month in fare media face value, at least initially. Existing
program participants currently purchase an average of $485,000 per month in fare media face
value. Cap represents an 18% increase over current sales.
 Existing agencies will be guaranteed the ability to purchase current average monthly pass/ticket
quantities plus 10%

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

RTD Board of Directors

Date: October 23, 2015

From:

Charles Sisk, Chair of Executive Committee

GM

Date:
Subject:

Board Meeting Date: October 27, 2015
Board Protocols for Community Engagement
and Events

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board of Directors adopt these guidelines for
planning RTD public hearings, public meetings and special events to coordinate with RTD Board
members’ schedules, and for informing Board members and senior leadership of relevant third-party
meetings and events.
BACKGROUND
As an elected body, the fifteen member Board represents a specific district as outlined in the redistricting map for the Regional Transportation District. It is customary that Board members will be
invited to speak or participate in community events, special public hearings, public meetings, elected
officials briefings, key stakeholder meetings and special events as part of their duties and
responsibilities to the community. These events are an important part of implementing RTD’s programs
and projects. When planning these events, it is essential that RTD staff, including the GM and SLT,
coordinate dates and times with RTD Board members’ schedules for meetings in their districts so that
they can attend if desired. While scheduling meetings to accommodate Board member availability is a
priority, there will be occasions when this is not possible.
In the past, this was an informal process followed by staff to extend an invitation for speaking to the
appropriate Director. However, as this agency transitions and institutionalized knowledge is lost, and
new Board members and staff come onboard, it is perceived important to formalize the process that will
be followed by this Agency to ensure inclusion of all Board members as appropriate. In 2016, RTD plans
to roll out four (4) major corridors, including the US 36 BRT, which will be characterized by a number of
hosted events. Having a formalized process on protocols for public engagements and community events
can provide guidance to the public information team or our event planning team as well as to the Board
members.
DISCUSSION
The attached agency procedure on Board protocols was initially proposed by Pauletta Tonilas, Public
Information. Director Judy Lubow, Board member district I, and Chair Sisk working in conjunction with
David Genova, Interim General Manager, provided the current revisions. Minimal changes to the original
proposal were made.
PROCEDURE FOR PLANNING RTD MEETINGS AND EVENTS AND INFORMING RTD PERSONNEL OF
THIRD-PARTY MEETINGS AND EVENTS
Meeting Scheduling: Typically, RTD staff will refrain from scheduling meetings and events on Tuesday
evenings due to RTD Board meetings. Friday evenings are also avoided unless a special circumstance
exists. Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays are often targeted for meetings and events to maximize
possible media exposure and to offer times that are generally conducive to most people’s schedules.

Third Party Sponsored Meetings: When local jurisdictions and other third-party entities working with
RTD schedule events and meetings that involve elected officials, policy matters or RTD high-level
issues or matters, RTD staff will notify Board members of the meetings and events in their districts as
soon as possible. While RTD staff does not control the scheduling of these events, RTD Board
members and senior leadership will at least be aware of these meetings and activities in the event that
they want to attend.
RTD Board Member Speaking Events: During some RTD events and meetings, it may be appropriate to
include RTD Board members or staff in the speaking program. RTD staff will engage Board members
and staff as appropriate to participate in a meeting or special event program. The Board Chair and
Board member where an event or meeting will occur will be the designated participants on the Board’s
behalf, at the Board Chair’s discretion, with the Chair informing the Board member if that member is
not chosen to speak. The Board Chair can designate another Board member to participate in his/her
place or defer to the Board member of the district to represent the Board.
If an event is planned by RTD and involves multiple Directors' districts, all such Directors should be
informed of the event. The Directors will be included as to any presentations or speeches with a
shared responsibility at presentation.
Outside Agency Request
If an outside agency invites a particular Director and/or the Chair to participate and it is not an RTD
sponsored event, this policy will not be applicable. It is vital for the Chair/Director(s) to recognize
those Directors in whose district the event takes place.
Procedure for Planning RTD Events and Meetings
 RTD staff leading the planning efforts will work with the respective board members for those
districts and identify some potential dates for an upcoming event or meeting and contact the
Board Office to make sure these dates are not in conflict with other events.
 Board members or the Board Office will respond in a timely manner with the dates/times that
work best for their schedules.
 If, after two attempts to coordinate with the Board member(s) schedules, staff does not hear
back about preferred dates/times, staff will continue with the scheduling of the meeting or
event.
 Once a meeting or event is scheduled, the item will be sent for inclusion in the RTD Board
Calendar. In addition, a notice will be distributed to the RTD Board, Board Office and
appropriate staff.
 Public meeting and special event dates will be posted on the RTD and/or FasTracks websites as
appropriate.
 For RTD policy-level and RTD-related events and meetings, RTD staff will coordinate
participation with the appropriate Board member(s) and staff. Talking points and/or presentation
materials will be provided as necessary.
 For third-party events and meetings involving policy issues, fellow elected officials or high-level
RTD matters, RTD staff will coordinate participation as necessary with the appropriate Board
member(s) and staff. Talking points and/or presentation materials will be provided as necessary.
 If a Board member or staff member is unable to participate after committing to a meeting or
event, he/she will personally contact the staff point-of-contact or notify Board Office staff, who
will in turn notify the staff point-of-contact.
 If a meeting or event date, time or program changes, RTD staff will notify the Board, Board
Office and appropriate staff as soon as possible.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action to formalize protocols for Board member speaking engagements
and participation in community events. This will provide a more equal opportunity for the
respective Board members and the districts that they represent. This will also provide clarity and
direction to our public information and event planning staff.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Continue to operate in the informal manner that exists
today. This will escalate the level of frustration expressed by Board members about events in
their respective districts that they were unaware or not invited to participate. This will leave new
staff public information team with lack of guidance as to Board expectations and appropriate
protocols.
