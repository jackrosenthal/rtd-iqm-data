RTD Board Meeting Recording 11-17-20
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Good evening. I will now call the Tuesday, November 17 RTD Board
meeting to order. We are convened as of 5:30 PM, Mountain Daylight Time. I would respectfully ask
everyone connected to this call to mute your phones and set your ringers to silent.
Please note that under the current circumstances, the official meetings of the RTD Board of Directors are
being held remotely in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. During this time, meetings will be
primarily audio recorded. And the audio recordings, along with the unofficial minutes of the meetings, will
be posted as soon as practicable on the Board's website. Please visit www.rtd-denver.com and scroll to
the bottom of that page for the link to the Board of Directors page.
If anyone on the phone this evening would like to engage with the Board during the public participation
portion of tonight's agenda, please press star three now. You will be placed into a queue. And I will call on
you at the appropriate time. Directors and members of staff, for the sake of the record, if you would like to
be acknowledged during tonight's proceedings, I would ask that you please announce your name and
wait for me to call you before proceeding to speak. Speaking out of turn will only add confusion to the
record and to the proceedings.
Please note that, at the appropriate time during the discussion and voting processes later on this evening,
I will call on each Director in turn. So please know that your time to speak will come. And if possible,
please hold your comments until that time. This evening, there will be no "Pledge of Allegiance" due to not
being in the same room together. I'm going to now do the roll call. Director Broom.

TROY WHITMORE: Present.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Good evening. I am here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I am here. So that's 15 present. This evening, there are no retiree
awards. And I would like to start with our safety moment. And like Director Williams last time, it's long. So
please bear with me.
Although recently much has been said and published about the risk of COVID transmission on public
transportation, there is very little contact tracing evidence that points to transmission on buses, trains, or
airplanes. But discussions takes place, because COVID transmission is linked to close contact in large
gatherings. That said, overall, ridership is down across the board. So getting on a crowded vehicle is far
less likely than in the past.
According to the Associated Press, there have been no significant outbreaks of COVID, defined as more
than two infected people from different households traced to the same event linked to transit systems. In
fact, Japan has not linked a single outbreak to their crowded commuter rail system since the pandemic
began. So not to be afraid to ride public transportation. And when you do, follow these guidelines to
ensure a safe trip for you and others.
Wear a face covering while waiting for your bus or train and while riding. Public health orders require that
you do. Anecdotally, we are seeing a high face covering use by passengers on most trips here at RTD.
Other agencies are reporting that upwards of 80% to 90% of passengers are wearing face coverings on
their system. So it seems the message is getting out. Maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet, as
much as you can.
The CDC says that if you can avoid situations where you are in close contact-- which is within 6 feet, or
more than 15 minutes-- with someone from outside your household, your chance of contracting COVID is
very low. Remember that wearing a face covering does not replace the need for social distancing. You
should do both.
Travel during non-peak hours, or skip more crowded buses, if that is possible. Avoid touching high-touch
surfaces as much as possible. According to the CDC, the likelihood of getting COVID from touching a
surface is much lower than through respiration. And RTD continues to deep clean vehicles every day.
Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap before you leave your house or office. And wash them again
as soon as you arrive at your destination. Carry hand sanitizer with you to use in between handwashing.
If you're feeling sick or have any COVID symptoms, please stay home and seek medical attention. With
the significant rise of COVID cases locally over the last three to four weeks, it is important that we are
even more vigilant about doing the things that we all need to do to keep ourselves and others safe. Thank
you.
OK, we are now in public participation. This is our public participation period, which is open to anyone
who would like to speak. As it is our custom, we allow any of our elected officials present to speak first so
that they can get back to their own meetings and attend businesses.
If you have indicated that you would like to speak to the Board by dialing star three on your phone, I will
call your name in order in which you signed up. Each speaker will be allowed three minutes. Also, please

bear in mind that participating in the process, you are being audio recorded. So if you do not wish to be
audio recorded, then your comments will have to be submitted in writing, and you will not have the
opportunity to speak this evening.
If any speaker has documentation or reference materials for the Board, please email those materials to
the Board Office at the following email address-- board.office@rtd-denver.com. The public participation
period is not the appropriate venue for back-and-forth discussion among speakers and the Board. Please
do not anticipate that the Board will respond to questions and comments at this time for that reason.
It's important that you state your name and address so that someone may follow up with you later on. For
anyone joining the call, if you would like to speak to the Board, you can press star three on your phone
now. And you will be placed into the queue. And when it's your turn to speak, I will call you by name. And
Mr. Sherman, I do not see anyone on here. Do you have anyone?
SHERMAN: I do not, either.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, well, we have absolutely no speakers in the queue. This is the first
time I've seen this. All right, with no callers in the queue, I'm going to close public participation period at
this time. The committee minutes were included in your Board packet. Are there any corrections from any
Directors?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Director -ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, go ahead, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: There is-- I think it was the November 11 meeting for the safety and security, the
security ad hoc committee. It records Director Williams as absent, but I believe she was there on
November 11.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. We can make that-KATE WILLIAMS: I was. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, we can make that change.
KATE WILLIAMS: Director Lewis is correct, I was there.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, thank you. Any other changes to the minutes? With that addition,
those committee reports will stand as submitted with the addition and will become part of the permanent
record. I would now like to turn it over to First Vice Chair Catlin to talk about the General Manager
Oversight and Performance update.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. Last-- I believe it was two weeks ago, we had an exit
interview/final performance review of Interim GM Paul Ballard. And a number of Board members, in
addition to committee members, participated. And we had a very good dialogue, and not only an
assessment of Paul's performance, but his assessment of the Board's performance, as well as the
agency. So we'll be providing a summary document for the Board to review later on in this month, I
suspect.
But the more urgent work that we're doing now is to develop the metrics by which we will be evaluating
Debra Johnson per the contract language that we have 120 days to develop mutually this plan for
evaluation and assessment. And so we're currently working on that and would welcome any Board
members' input. If you could provide that to the Board Office, that would be great. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Thank you, Chair. When do you need those comments by, please?
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, we had asked for them, Barbara, I believe, by today or tomorrow.

BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: I don't have my notes in front of me. But we're starting this process. So there could be
there could be additional input at any time.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. OK, next is-NATALIE MENTEN: Menten.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Menten.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, I just wanted to comment about the exit interview. And unfortunately, the
General Manager Oversight Committee decided on a vote to go into executive session for the public. But
what that means is, if we had a closed-door meeting, the public was not included in that. And so if they
would go to the list of meetings for RTD, they would not find an audio recording of this meeting.
I just wanted the public to know I voted against going into a closed-door meeting. I think an exit interview
as to the status of the agency is, without a doubt, a meeting that should have been in a public venue. And
I think it's interesting that we're going to provide a summary. But I think the best thing for transparency as
our number one goal for 2020 would be that we would reverse that vote or take a vote and agree to
publish that audio recording that we did take for the public, and the employees, and anybody else to hear
what we discussed behind closed door, word for word. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank, you Director Menten.
PEGGY CATLIN: Madame Chair, if I might.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please. Go ahead, First Vice Chair.
PEGGY CATLIN: And maybe Melanie can address this. But it was really for the purpose of personnel
matters in evaluating Paul's performance. But as many of us discussed, we believe any performance
evaluation is a two-way street and a two-way dialogue, which is why we chose to conduct it that way.
Thank you for allowing me to clarify that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. General Counsel, do you have anything to add?
MELANIE SNYDER: Thank you, Madam Chair. This is Melanie Snyder, General Counsel. And yes,
Director Catlin's correct. The meeting and executive session were properly noticed under the open
meeting clause, including the basis for the executive session to be personnel matters. And we gave the
detail that it was purposely for the exit interview and performance evaluation of Mr Ballard. So yes, those
were proper grounds.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. OK, well, next is our approval of Board minutes as of October
27, 2020. May I please have a motion to approve the minutes from the regulatory-BOB BROOM: Approve approval.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --Board. Broom?
BOB BROOM: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Do I have a second?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Second, Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. So we have Director Broom is the movement, and Director
Lewis is the second. Unless there is any discussion, we will proceed with the voice vote. Are there any no
votes on the approval of the Board meeting minutes? Hearing none, that motion is adopted to the
minutes, and they are approved.
Next is the Chair's report. And I would like to take this time to acknowledge all of the individuals who ran
for a seat on the RTD Board during this election cycle. This Board, along with the people who are served

by RTD, applaud your dedication and willingness to serve, regardless of whether you were a victor in your
particular race.
And for those of you listening and whom may not even know y'all, their names, these Directors who will
be joining us on the Board next year are, for District 8, returning Director Kate Williams; for District D, our
new Board member elect, Bobby Dishell; for District 8, our new Board member, Director Paul Rosenthal;
for Director F, returning Director Bob Broom; for District G, new Director Julien Bouquet; for district H,
returning Director Doug Tisdale; for District I, Director Eric Davidson; and for Director M-- or District M, I'm
sorry-- Director Marjorie Sloan.
So over the next three months, these Directors will be engaging in an extensive orientation program
conducted by our amazing staff. And they're already drinking from the fire hose. Directors, I wish you the
best in the years to come. And I look forward to meeting with all of you and working with all of you.
And as you know, you've already gone through two orientations. So you have six hours under your belt.
I'm sure that you're feeling a little like there is a lot of information. So congratulations and welcome. With
that, I would like to turn it over to our new General Manager.
BOB BROOM: Madame Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, Director Broom, please.
BOB BROOM: I have a question. Will we get any information about the tool votes cast for RTD Directors
versus the total vote period? I'd be curious to know how much dropoff there is when people vote the ballot
before they get down to RTD.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's a good question. We can probably secure that information from the
Secretary of State's office. Mr. McKay, can you help us retrieve those numbers?
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, John is off the call right now. But I will make sure that our office works with the
Secretary of State to get that information.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
BOB BROOM: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Broom. OK, with that, our new General Manager, Debra
Johnson. Welcome, your first week.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Well, good evening, Madam Chair. Thank you, and greetings to you, and members
of the Board, and to all who are virtually assembled. As introduced, I am Debra Johnson, the General
Manager and Chief Executive Officer of the Regional Transportation District. It's my pleasure to be here
with you tonight and offer to you my first report. Recognizing that I began my role as City General
Manager and CEO on November 9, it was an immensely busy week in reference to me going out,
meeting the hard working men and women of the Regional Transportation District.
I had the opportunity to visit three operating divisions, conducted an all-hands meeting with our valuable
employees, and hosted a virtual press conference on Monday as well. I've also had the opportunity to
engage with a myriad of stakeholders ranging from the state representatives, including regional
representatives at various agencies, including Denver Regional Council of Governments, as well as
meeting with our union partners. So recognizing that I have a lot more on my plate in reference to me
getting familiar with the region, as well as offering relationships for the betterment of the District, I look
forward to that and working collaboratively cooperatively with our stakeholders, as well as with all of you.
One thing for certain I'd like to do at the conclusion of my brief report is to acknowledge our appreciation
on behalf of all the men and women here at RTD, and thank Heather McKillop, our CFO and Assistant

General Manager of Finance and Administration for five-plus years of service to RTD. Recognizing that
she's made some contributions that have bettered the organization, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge her,
such that it is her last meeting. And I want to wish her the ultimate success as she travels west to the
Sonoma Marina area rail transit property to serve in the capacity as the CFO there. So with that, Madame
Chair, that concludes my report. Thank you very kindly.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, General Manager. All right, next is our public hearing on the
2021 recommended budget for Tuesday, November 17, 2020. Ladies and gentlemen, the Chair hereby
calls to order the public hearing on the Regional Transportation District's recommended budget for the
year 2021.
In accordance with both RTD's requirements and local government statutes, notice of the public hearing
was duly posted in the Office of the Executive Manager of the Board of Directors Office. The notice was
published in two major daily newspapers of the district prior to October 15, 2020, and on the RTD
website. Copies of the notice and certification of such notice will be part of the record of this day's
hearing.
Persons who have not already indicated a desire to speak during this budget hearing should press star
three now. This public hearing will be conducted under the rules and regulations for the public hearings
adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District. And a copy of those rules will
be part of the record of this hearing.
The Chair would like to point out that the testimony will be limited to the subject of the public hearing. And
the presentations of the testimony must be no longer than three minutes. Written testimony should be
presented to Barbara McManus, executive Manager of the Board Office, for distribution to the Board. Her
email address is barbara.mcmanus@rtd-denver.com.
The 2021 recommended budget was previously distributed to each Board Director tonight. And a copy is
available for the public on the RTD website. And once again, there is nobody in the queue to ask a
question. Mr. Sherman, are you seeing the same thing?
SHERMAN: Got it. Yes, I do, ma'am.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. With that, I would like to request a motion to adopt the 2021
recommended budget.
KATE WILLIAMS: So move, Director Williams.
SHELLEY COOK: Second, and Shelley Cook.
TROY WHITMORE: Second, Whitmore.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I have the movement as Director Williams and the second as Second Vice
Chair Cook. Is there any discussion?
JUDY LUBOW: I-- this is Director Lubow.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
JUDY LUBOW: I just have one question. We-- at least I received, later in the day, a copy of the letter from
Governor Polis to Angie and Debra to our Chair. And it asks that there be no cuts in employees until we
see if there's going to be more federal stimulus dollars. And I would think that that would have an impact
on our budget. And I'm just wondering how we handle the timing of talking to the Governor about that, as
well as doing this budget.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: CEO Johnson, would you like to respond to that?

DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes, thank you very much, Madam Chair. And Thank you, Director Lubow, for that
question. Recognizing that we are in a place in which we don't know what stimulus money is coming in,
considering that the budget was prepared taking in consideration a reduction in force, the one thing that I
have talked with staff about is in relationship to any type of recovery plans.
And there always is the option for a recission of layoff notices, should we get to a point, and if that's the
pleasure of the Board in recognizing that we do need to be the good public stewards, but recognizing as
well that our employees are valued, and we do need them to deliver service. But we will be addressing in
conjunction with all of you, if necessary, and can do any type of budget mid-year modifications, if
necessary. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Does that answer your question Director Lubow?
JUDY LUBOW: Yes. And I would like to raise a talk at some point about our response to the Governor,
because it raises an interesting question of interaction with his office. And that we can-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Agreed. And-JUDY LUBOW: Yeah, OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, I'm sorry. I was just going to say, I agree we you. We'll be talk-JUDY LUBOW: No, no, no, that's-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead.
JUDY LUBOW: No, no. Go ahead.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, I said I agree with you. We do have an Accountability Committee report
later on. And we will be talking about the Governor's letter.
JUDY LUBOW: OK, thank you very much.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. With that, I'd like to call for a vote on the adoption of the 2021 budget.

SHONTEL LEWIS: Director Lewis.
JUDY LUBOW: Director Lubow.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think I heard Director Lewis first, and then Director Lubow. Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you. We had had this discussion. And I made a few comments. Specifically, I
was interested in some data, because I was concerned about folks who might be unbanked,
underbanked, or not have access to a smart phone. And I hadn't received that.
And so I will still be a no. But I just wanted to put that on the record, as that was something that I shared
during our last committee meeting. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank, you, ma'am.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Madam Chair, this is Heather.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, please go ahead, Miss McKillop.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I apologize. I sent that the next day. So I'll check with the Board Office to see why
that didn't get out. But-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Okay.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --I did send that last Wednesday to the Board Office. But we'll get that-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I can get that information forwarded right now to Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, thank you so very much.
SPEAKER 3: Or make it to all of us, if you would. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That would be great.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, I don't have access to send it to the whole Board. But I will get it over to
Barbara right now. So hopefully, she can get it out again.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That would be wonderful. Thank you so much. Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes, Thank you. I was just wondering if Heather could summarize for us what agreeing to
this locks us in with Masabi for, not only with what the contract says, but because of practicalities.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Miss McKillop.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Sure, Madam Chair. This is Heather McKillop. So our current contract with
Masabi goes until-- I believe it's March of 2023. So that's how long we will be under contract with them.
We will then rebid that contract sometime in 2022, the previous year, 'cause it will take a while to put
together the RFP and get it out and award it.
So we do plan on rebidding it, regardless, in 2022. And that will provide an opportunity for others to bid, in
addition to Masabi. And then we will select a vendor at that time. So at this point in time, our current
obligation-- and even if you approve this, the obligation would still be-- they would be under contract until
March of 2023.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And Heather-- yes. And I want to wish Heather a fond goodbye.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Oh, thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, Heather, we're going to miss you. Thank you. Any other discussion?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And I-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, go ahead.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I'll work on getting this memo out. It goes to Director Lewis right now.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. Any other discussion? Hearing none, I'm going to call for
the vote. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Secretary Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: First Vice Chair Catlin.

Folska, Director Lewis, and Director Menten. That passes.
Our next item is the authorization of the fiscal authority to the GM for the North Metro Rail Line project. Do
I have a motion?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

VINCE BUZEK: Buzek, so move.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, wait a minute. There were a lot of people at one time. I heard Buzek,
but there were about five other people. I have Buzek. Who seconds?
JUDY LUBOW: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Lubow is first, and Buzek is second. Any discussion on this item?
NATALIE MENTEN: Menten.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please, Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah. Even though the decision to delegate the authority, especially related to realestate decisions, was given away in 2013-- and this action would not correct 2013-- I'm still going to be a
no vote. But just as a statement that-- and the Board, perhaps unaware of the consequences, delegated
away that authority.
There was a downside. I wish we could go back and change the 2013 vote. But for tonight, I'll just be
voting no on that, simply for this reason. So thank you. I just wanted that on the record.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. Any other discussion? Hearing none, I'm going to go in
reverse order. Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: I am a Yes vote

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I am a yes. That is 13 yeses and two nos, the nose being Director
Mihalik and Director Menten. The motion passes.
OK, there is no executive session this evening. However, we do have old business under the
Accountability Committee. At this time, I'd like to ask the Chair and Vice Chair of our Communications and
Government Relations Committee, Directors Guissinger and Whitmore, to give us an update on the
proceedings of the Accountability Committee. Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Great. Thanks. And I'll start it off and let you carry on, Troy. The Accountability
Committee started their work at this point, and moving along fairly quickly. They have three
subcommittees that meet twice a month. And then the full committee is meeting once a month to go
through some of the suggestions and things like that.
The Governance Committee-- well, we'll get to that later. The Finance Committee is the one looking at
these potential legislative changes to RTD statutes that we set out. And thank you, for those who sent
comments.
I had three or four people send comments. And we discussed it some at the Executive Committee. And
there were the Executive Committee and several others there. But they're looking for comments from the
Board. And I sent it out.
I don't plan to spend a lot of time with it. But basically, they're looking at the four statutes that we've talked
about some in the past. It would be nice, I think, generally, is the sense that I'm hearing from staff and in
earlier comments that these statutes-- that the flexibility makes sense for the Board. At the same time,
they're not going to be game changing. They're not going to make us a lot of money, those sorts of things.
But they do keep options open. So the first one is the fare box recovery ratio that we've discussed is not
really a meaningful number, because it includes grants, and other things that are not just fare box
numbers. So as McKillop has said, many times, it's not a number that's used in the transit industry.
But it could potentially limit us by saying that 30% of RTD's operating costs have to come from these
revenues. They were changing that to take it away. And they are proposing two additional measures that- one of them is that the district's, in its financial reporting, will show operating cost-- ridership and
operating cost divided by ridership, those measures with the cost efficiency of services.
And the other is the District. In its financial reporting, it will show total carbon emissions based on fuel
consumption divided by ridership as a measure of environmental impact of services. The second
provision that they're looking at is the-- it's generally called the TOD provision. But it talks about retail and
commercial goods and services. And their thought is that it puts restrictions on what RTD can do in terms
of that RTD cannot make agreements or work with others on projects that will reduce the availability of
adequate parking for the public or could result in a competitive disadvantage to nearby private facilities.
So they're recommending taking out those restrictions. Looking for my glasses. Then they've added a
provision in there that says any development of any portion of a transfer facility made available by the
district for the provision of retail or commercial goods or services or for the provision of residential uses or
other uses shall be subject to all applicable local zoning ordinances, except for parking requirements,
which will be established by RTD. Or RTD may also, at its option, charge fees for parking at district
parking facilities.
So that last sentence replaces the next provision [? 32.9.119.9, ?] in which there were limitations on
RTD's authority to charge fees for parking. And basically, they're taking that out, and just putting that
sentence in.

I don't think-- we have made the point with staff, and Troy and I and others have made the point with the
committee, that the Board is well aware that charging for parking has its problems. That can be seen as
another way of raising fares. And they understand that we are not intending to move on that in any way.
But the idea is to keep flexibility.
For instance, if a local government wanted to control parking in certain ways to reach other goals-climate goals, or other things-- or if we wanted to manage parking and move people from one place to
another, this would help. The final provision is the provision on contracting. And they left in the 58%
maximum, although I think they're open to sharing comment on that. But what they did was add a
provision that said that-- just modified the provision that says RTD can contract services to private
businesses. And they expanded that to include non-profit organizations and local governments.
So after talking with a number of the staff, and some other comments, we went back to them and said,
basically-- we told them we would get more comments after tonight. But basically, these seem OK.
They're not going to be game changing.
But the flexibility is appreciated, but that we were concerned about opening up the language for a lot of
amendments. And we made the point that, if they do move forward, it needs to be in a tightly phrased
way, pull a very tight bill title. In fact, it would probably be four bill titles that deal with each one of these,
rather than a broader statute that deals with RTD. And my sense is that they probably will move forward
in that way.
It's their move. And I think to go with-- talk to the legislators and decide if this is the right time. So given all
of that, thank you to those who've given comments. And I guess what I'd like to do, Madam Chair, is open
this up for other comments, if you want to run through the group. Is that the best way to do that?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I agree. Director Broom?
BOB BROOM: I don't have any real comments. I just have a concern that any time a bill gets introduced
in the legislature, you run the risk that somebody is going to strike the entire bill and just use the bill for a
really draconian measure. And they frequently do that in the last week of the session. And you don't have
a chance to respond to it. So just to put the legislature on notice that we have a concern about having the
ability to respond to any future or additional restraints put on RTD. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Secretary Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Madame Chair. I've got no comments. I appreciate Directors Guissinger and
Whitmore staying on top of all this. And with regard to the Governor's letter, I don't think I'll make much of
a comment, other than to say I was just a little bit surprised. That's all I have. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. First Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. I agree with Director Broom and hope that we have the ability to provide
input on a very narrowly defined bill title so that there isn't a draconian measure taken, as Director Broom
said. And I, too, was a bit surprised with the Governor's letter. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Second Vice Chair Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: I've had a chance-- in the Executive Committee meeting, and otherwise-- to weigh in.
But I appreciate the openness in terms of other comments. I don't have any, at this point. And let me
know if you want to take up separately the question of providing information to the Accountability
Committee and the Governor in response to the Governor's letter.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. I may call back on you then. Director Folska.

CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Director Guissinger and Director Whitmore for
all of the work that you've put in and that you will continue to do with the Accountability Committee on
behalf of our city. I really appreciate your effort. That's all.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. I'm going to go past you, Director Guissinger. I can come back,
unless you have any additional stuff.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, that's fine.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I have two questions. The first question is, has this
document been shared with our union folks and our contractors? That's my first question. And the second
is, has this document been shared with our staff as well for them to provide the feedback, input?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger.
SHONTEL LEWIS: And thank you, our senior leadership team. Thank you.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes, the document has been shared with staff. And we've had several
conversations. I don't know that it's been to everyone. But we've been working with our counsel and Mr.
Van Meter, and Bill Sirois and Pauletta, and I think others-- Heather. So we have been getting comments
along the way.
And it's not really a document. At least, I haven't considered it a document to share with the union. It's a
thought, and a good thought. We have encouraged the Accountability Committee to vet it further. And
they, I think, plan to do that, and also to point out that the legislative process does that well. But I'll
mention that to him.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK, thank you. And then just one quick question, one follow-up for you, Lynn. I'm
curious. You mentioned Mr Van Meter, and I think that makes sense. I'm curious if this has been shared
with Zami and the Civil Rights group.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I haven't done that. But it's a very good idea. And we can do that tomorrow.
SHONTEL LEWIS: All right, cool. Thank you. That's all I have. Thank you so much for your work-LYNN GUISSINGER: Thanks, that's a good suggestion.
SHONTEL LEWIS: --Director Guissinger and Director Whitmore.
LYNN GUISSINGER: You're welcome.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lewis. Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes, thank you. I wanted to also share in the thank you's to Directors Whitmore and
Guissinger for all the work you're doing on this. This is like having a whole other directorship meet jobs.
So really appreciate all this extra work. It's incredibly important, I think.
I had a couple of points. One was about the-- since this is being raised, the percentage of private
contractors that would be used at RTD. And I think, as of now, we have 58%. And it all seems like an
incredibly arbitrary number to me.
And I'm wondering. I think the union should be asked, is this a good number as far as you're concerned?
And what are the pros and cons of changing that number? I have no idea if that 58% number is a help or
not to us. And it seems like this might be a good time to probe a little deeper into that. So that's one
concern.
And the other has to do with the Governor's letter. And what I felt from just quickly reading it was, wow,
he's got a lot of concerns, as well he should, about potential layoff of lots of staff. But it seems like there's
a lot that he doesn't know, because we've been hashing this issue out for a long time. And to me, it made

sense that, wow, if we could have better interaction with the Governor's office, we might not have needed
that letter, because it would have been answered already by now.
And it reminded me of something that Dave Genova, I believe with the Mayor of Denver, would have-this is all hearsay. So I believe it was quarterly meetings with the Mayor so that they could work together
and make sure that there weren't information glitches and problems. And I wished that that would have
happened with other people, in addition to Denver, because I think something like that might be very
helpful with the stakeholders in the North, building relationships with them to prevent communication
problems from happening.
And now the same thing with the Governor's office. So I think this is a grand opportunity, really, to think
about, can we establish more regular contact with these important stakeholders so that they know a lot of
the things, and they don't need to write us letters about it? But that was just-- I guess I'm just riffing on
that thought. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Could I go at the end? I'm looking up a data point that I'd like to bring up, and I don't
have my fingers on it quite yet, please.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: Thank you, Madam Chair. And yes, thank you to Directors Whitmore and Guissinger. I
think a lot more work than they would've thought it was going to be.
I saw the Governor's letter. And he's certainly not wrong in that the CARES Act funding stalled or
supplemented funding so that we could operate in the condition that we were operating. But I do think that
it's again delaying the recommended reductions as the, I would say, unintended consequence of possibly
making those reductions even more, even greater, when they actually do come around.
So stalling on that action may have the effect of having even more layoffs down the road. That's my only
observation on that. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Let me join the bandwagon in expressing
tremendous appreciation to Directors Guissinger and Whitmore for their work on the Accountability
Committee. I have monitored the Committee on a DRCOG website with the videos, and they have been
doing an excellent job. Relative to the Accountability Committee in general, I shared my thoughts at the
Executive Committee meeting, which is of record and available for anyone to see. So I incorporate those
remarks herein by reference as though fully set forth.
Lastly, concerning the Governor's letter, I don't know if this is really the appropriate time or even the
appropriate body to address that specifically. In the first instance, you will recall that the specific decision
relative to any layoffs was one made by the General Manager, because the General Manager is
responsible for those management decisions. And the Board has approved a budget that contemplates
reductions in force for next year. And we do have that power. And we've done that.
But the General Manager has the power as well to adjust how that is accomplished and when,
specifically, it is accomplished. I note that the Governor does appreciate the fact that we face difficult
times. And obviously, the Governor and others have gone through this when they made the determination
to have furloughs of state employees through June 30 of next year. So it's a complicated issue. But in the
first instance I submitted is one for the General Manager to address, with and upon input from this Board,
of course. Thank you, Madam Chair.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Walker
JEFF WALKER: Thank you. Yeah, I'm sure the Governor is in a difficult position. And that letter was
written expressing the difficulty and the understanding that we all-- he is also in a difficult position. I'll
leave it there. I did have a little bit of a head scratch. But hearing the comments helped bring some clarity
to me.
Regarding the Accountability Committee, I hope that the Accountability Committee, or the next governor,
or the current governor, or whoever is in charge years from now understands that there are limits to what
RTD can do. And this is addressing some of the comments that came up from the Finance Committee,
the Accountability Committee Finance Committee.
There are limits of what we can do. And if we're freed from the constrictions that are in the state statutes,
that doesn't necessarily guarantee an influx of revenue. There are market forces-- real-estate market,
financial market, et cetera, et cetera-- for people to want to develop on the land, or for people to want or
need to ride a bus.
As much as I love the bus, I've only been on it twice since March, because I have nowhere to go. And the
airlines are in the same positions. And restaurants and all these other industries are in the same position.
So I hope that, if these changes are made, and development doesn't happen, and revenues don't
increase immediately, that whoever is in charge looks and says, OK, there are other forces at work that
do constrain RTD. And there are limits to what they do. However, I do like the steps that they're going
towards, at least in the Finance Committee or subcommittee.
Those are things that are familiar from 150, I think. What was it? 151, the Senate bill from last-- or earlier
this year.
And I think-- oh, yeah, so that's all I have. There are other parts of the Accountability Committee that I've
been following. I'll reserve those for later. Hopefully, I get to talk about them this year. If I don't get to talk
about them this year, I will definitely talk about them next year. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Thanks, Madam Chair. Certainly, Director Walker, we appreciate your comments
anytime, as we did tonight. I appreciate the Director Broom's concern on the legislative matters and
making sure that we're careful, and we being, I guess, the corporate we with Accountability Committee,
legislators, ourselves, and our staffs. Director Lewis, appreciate your points and questions as well.
I would like to acknowledge staff, because we've had a lot of quick turnaround-type conversations
needed. And the flexibility that a number of the senior staff have exhibited-- whether it's been Heather
earlier on, or Bill, or Melanie, or other Bill, obviously Paulette and others-- it's been very helpful as we
have been asked for input. And our staff has certainly been up to the task in assisting Director Guissinger
and us, the rest of us.
I would just like to acknowledge in a big way our Chair of the Committee Lynn Guissinger. She's doing the
heavy lifting as quite a avid liaison for us and really has been the stalwart there. I just try and keep up with
her and help where I can.
Now, the Governor's letter was a bit of a head-scratcher. Somebody mentioned the one thing that I find
interesting is the mention of the CARES Act funding and oversight. And from what I understand, that was
a calling for the Accountability Committee. And I don't know that they've done too much of that yet. But I
think-- Chair Guissinger, if you'd like to tone in-- that they were noticing that. And they were going to
address that, I think, in the next month or two.

With that, thanks for your thanks. But I spend about 98% of it in Lynn Guissinger's wake. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a couple of thoughts. I find it interesting that the
Governor of Colorado feels that he needs to tell RTD, which is the Regional Transportation District for this
area, how they should run their agency and spend their funding. I wonder if he does that with other
transportation agencies around the state. And I wonder if he has looked at other agencies that might have
issues with layoffs and with funding.
I know that I run a nonprofit that helps people and charges no fees. And I've had my funding cut by 40%
and have had to make changes. So I think it's not just RTD. So I'm with the head scratching. I'm
wondering what Jared Polis is interested in that specific to RTD and that maybe the Accountability
Committee ought to ask that question.
I'm glad to see that they are doing their work. And I'm sure that they will find results that are beneficial to
the riders of RTD. That is who we are all here to serve. Most members of the Accountability Community
who are elected officials and all of us are here to serve the riders of RTD. And I'm sure that the governor
is there to do that also. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Guissinger, I'm going to pass it back over to you.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK, great. Thanks. That's some good feedback, and we will follow up on it. And
let's see. Director-- oh, let's see. I think you still need to talk to Director Menten, didn't you?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. Director Menten, please.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah, thank you. So the first question that i got reading the letter from the Governor
is that he seems to be very unaware of where we're at. And there has been months of discussion about
many of these topics, including the very low ridership, near-empty buses in parts of the district.
The CARES Act was basically paying the day-to-day bills and it couldn't be [INAUDIBLE]. But anyway,
he's very unaware of where we're at in this process. So I wonder, was this letter prompted by some
members of the Accountability Committee poking him?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. I'm going to assume that the letter was in response to a meeting with
our new General Manager this morning. That's my understanding. Is that yours, Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I don't really know what prompted it. I know that they did have a conversation. But
I'm not-- clearly, it was written before that. So that could have made him think of us. But I doubt it was
anything from the Accountability Committee.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I don't think so.
NATALIE MENTEN: Well, since the General Manager was potentially mentioned in that thread, GM
Johnson, do you have anything to add to that, since you had what appears to be a very recent
conversation with the Governor?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Yes, Madam Chair and Director Menten. As indicated, I did have a meet-and-greet
this afternoon-- or, I should say, late this morning-- with the Governor. And basically, the intent of the
conversation was to ensure that I was cognizant of all these issues, having recently located in this area.
He wanted to ensure that I personally had an understanding, hearing from him, what was before us.
I would surmise that the letter was probably already crafted, because when the call concluded, I received
the letter shortly thereafter. And it was referenced in the course of the dialogue that ensued that there

would be some form of communique that was forthcoming. So with that as the backdrop, that's my only
understanding as it relates to the genesis of the correspondence received today. Thank you very kindly.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
DEBRA JOHNSON: All right, thank you. So then moving on, there seems to be a good chunk of this letter
that-- I don't know-- just pushed aside that we have looked at cuts. The budget reflects that, although it
should be noted that there was a motion that myself and others had put forward to have additional
reduction in salaries. And that did, unfortunately, fail on a six to nine vote. And that was not including the
budget.
But there have been some cuts in the ridership. Certainly, concern is maybe--. If you want to push Polis to
maybe either follow Colorado Public Radio on Twitter, or read the articles, because I think he would give
it a good soundbite-- it might be easier doing that than listening into our meetings. But maybe we should
give him the call-in number so he can keep up with those things. He might enjoy that.
But beyond that, one thing I will mention-- well, I count a lot of this letter as irrelevant, because these
questions have been answered. The one thing he does bring up-- and as anybody who writes a letter, you
know that if you really want to focus on something, one of the areas you put it is at the end of the letter,
because that's the way people read. But what he does mention is-- and I'm just going back to my doc
here. So I have it highlighted.
In the very last substantive paragraph he says, regarding the CARES Act, "It is essential that the public
see exactly where the money is going." Now, the Accountability Committee will be getting some
information. But how could we promote our number-one goal at RTD of transparency and communication
and make it much easier for the public to see exactly where the CARES Act money is going? And that is
my question.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis, go ahead.
SHONTEL LEWIS: I would just like to take the opportunity, because we are in old business, to bring up a
discussion that Director Cook and I had many, many, many moons ago regarding transparency within our
budget. We had looked at utilizing a platform for which our constituents and our stakeholders could easily
assess the budget and also understand the balance in terms of what's needed to give in order for
something else to be available. I thought that was a really great opportunity.
I think other agencies use it, in addition to-- Denver Public Schools is an agency that uses it, and I believe
the city and county of Denver. Director Cook, you can correct me if I'm wrong. But this is really all about
budget transparency. And the fee was actually quite minimal. If I recall correctly, it was maybe $10,000 to
$15,000 and, I think, an asset for us as Directors when we talk about budget transparency and helping
folks to understand the decisions that staff are making in terms of budget priorities.
Director Cook, feel free to jump in. But I just wanted to not have that floating, Director Menten. There are
some ways in which we can improve transparency and meaningful engagement with our budget, with our
stakeholders, and our constituents.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, thank you. Director Menten, did you have anything else?
NATALIE MENTEN: Really, I would look for an answer as to specifically the CARES Act. And there's
budget, and then there's expenditures. And yes, we, yea, got our check register in great detail online this
year. And that is one option. But how could we narrow it and make it even more publicly visible about the
CARES Act expenditures?

'Cause really right now, at this moment, without me going in and drilling down in the check register and
using object code or departments, or we have really good object codes, I don't even know what we've got
left of CARES Act at this very moment. So how do we share that even beyond the Accountability
Committee? But as the Governor said, it is essential that the public see exactly where the money is going.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you.
NATALIE MENTEN: So that's my question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: General-NATALIE MENTEN: Is that something that McKillop can help us today?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. I was going to ask the General Manager if she'd like to take this, and
maybe her and her team address it.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Thank you, Madam Chair. At this juncture, I'm going to defer to General Counsel. I'd
like her to respond. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
MELANIE SNYDER: Hi, Madame Chair. It's Melanie Snyder. And I'm sure Ms. McKillop is on the line as
well. Just for the Board's reference, that information with respect to the CARES Act funding has been
provided to the Accountability Committee.
And it's on RTD's Accountability Support page. And I'm happy to send around a link to that. It's an Excel
spreadsheet that has tabs on it and that reflects that detail.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
MELANIE SNYDER: You're welcome.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right.
NATALIE MENTEN: Menten.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten. Yes, go ahead.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Madame Chair?
NATALIE MENTEN: Awesome.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Director Folska.
NATALIE MENTEN: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I apologize. I do have a question for Director Guissinger and Director Whitmore-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: --regarding the Accountability Committee. Thank you. When this SB 151 was
originally put forth, the primary purpose I thought was for greater accessibility for people with disabilities.
And thus far, I'm not hearing anything about that. Did that go away? Or what's going on with that on the
Accountability Committee?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, that hasn't gone away. And I think that the Accountability Committee is
focused-- one of their focus areas is for people with disabilities and other equity concerns. But this
particular set of provisions are just-- I call it the low-hanging fruit. It's some provisions that have been
discussed over the years.
There are things that are seen as restrictions currently in the statute. And they're carrying on with some of
the other things they're looking at. I don't know if any of the subcommittees have gotten too far into those

issues at this point. But I know they're planning to try to jump, if you know of something. I think, right now,
the Governance-TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Go ahead.
TROY WHITMORE: Well, that topic will become-- sorry. This is Director Whitmore. Operations
subcommittee is where that will be discussed in more detail. And we've had a couple of short meetings in
regard to input and concerns, certainly more to come, Director Folska, from that subcommittee.
They actually meet tomorrow at 3:00. And they're going to be talking about the pass programs tomorrow,
among another couple of topics. But that will definitely be probably a lot of the heavy lifting after the
holidays. Thank you.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: OK. If I may, Madame Chair. Thank you. Madam Chair, if I may.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you. So just for the record, the issue of better care transit service delivered to
our customers with disability was the, I thought-- and I could be wrong in my recollection, but was the
primary moving piece of this. And all the other parts that we're talking about tonight fell underneath it in
the long thing. But that was a primary talking point that people were getting riled up.
In fact, we had several days of testimony at the Capitol with many, many, many people for people with
disabilities-- advocates for people with disabilities, people with disabilities themselves. I, myself, testified
specifically on the issue of care transit. So I find it very interesting to see how it sank to the bottom, and
these other issues have risen to the top.
And I just want you to be cognizant of that because, typically, that's just what happens to folks with
disabilities. It really just is another other. Absolutely. And I'll repeat that-- another other. So that that's all I
have to say. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Folska. Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, I would just say, thanks, Director Folska. And it's a good reminder. I would
just say I don't think I would read this as sinking to the bottom. I think it's rising to the top.
I think these are things that exist in the current statutes that are restrictions. And the two issues have
gone to two different subcommittees. And I think it's just a timing thing. And actually, that was-- as I say,
we are encouraging the Accountability Committee to just wait and see if there are any other statutory
changes that needed to come up in the future. But I think my sense is this is going to move forward on
these.
The other provisions certainly were more controversial, I think. But I definitely think the idea of the
Accountability Committee is to put people together to really think through the pros and cons of our service
to the people with disabilities and others. And so I think that is moving forward.
Just a couple of other quick things-- Director Lubow, I think you had some very good points. And with
respect to the-- and several people mentioned there are things we are doing that the Governor is
unaware of. I know that Ms. Johnson and the Chair assume that we'll be sending a letter back. But I think
we had started early in the process, early in the pandemic. And I think there were two or three letters that
went from the Chair and the GM.
And then that fell away-- to the Governor. And he starts his letter by thanking us for the update. And I
think it's a good reminder to maybe start this up again and keep the office informed. And I think that's all I
have.

Troy covered what the Operations Committee is looking at right now, which is fares and passes. And then
the Governance Committee is looking at the possibility of creating some local, perhaps, subregional chip
forms as a local body to help decide funding of local transit issues. I think there are a lot of issues to be
decided there. But I'm just putting that out. It's something that's being discussed.
All of these meetings are public. I know several of the attendees were missing data. But they're all
welcome to any of them. And so I'd say, thanks for this. I think that Dr. Cook had a little more feedback on
the Governor's letter. And we'll take the feedback back. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thanks to Director Guissinger and Director
Whitmore for the work in interfacing, providing such good support for the agency and the accountability
effort. I did want to address a couple of things here, if I may.
First of all, it really is the case that we can provide more input, I think, to the Accountability Committee.
And I think I'm grateful for the fact that the Governor has invited us to do that. And that's something I can
certainly help with to the extent that things that relate to the financial pieces. I wanted to recap quickly on
that.
On CARES Act, as my understanding is, the CARES Act under FTA-- we received our CARES Act
funding pursuant to FDA guidelines. And in the way that that was done, that money, up to $232 million,
was provided for on a reimbursement basis. We could get reimbursement for expenses that qualified,
rather than getting a dollop of money and then spending that, and so being accountable in the way we
should about that. It's done a little bit differently for our particular sector.
And the FDA guidelines were pretty broad. So just to recap, if you recall, we understood this when the
CARES Act passed earlier in the year. And we knew we faced huge unknowns with regard to what future
receipts would be-- whether or not there'd be added stimulus, what would happen with the economy, et
cetera. And so our direction to the staff back in May was to be as conservative as we could and take
advantage of that broad reimbursement capability under the FDA to actually build a buffer for the great
unknown in 2021.
So a combination of reduced spending in 2020 to try to do that, the actual improved sales and use tax
compared to what we had expected. And that reduced spending that we went ahead into the assumptions
that we should assume the worst and curtail spending to the extent possible will give us about $100
million going into 2021. Now, that still leaves us with a pretty significant shortfall. It's, I think, currently
estimated to be $141 million.
And just to put that into context, the operating budget for the coming year before-- the operating budget
we adopted at the end of last year for 2020 assumed-- I use a pie chart. And I subtract things like
planning, and capital, and administrative. But based upon that, that adopted budget pie chart, our
operating budget was about $511 million.
Well, we're going to be short $141. And compared to that, that is about 28%. So even knowing that we've
been able to, through a combination of actions and the CARES Act, build a buffer for 2021, and that
allowed us to put off any layoffs, we still are facing some pretty significant unknowns and shortfalls. So I
thought it would be good to get that on the record.
As Judy Lubow suggested, we've been hashing through a lot of this already. And I can't say I'm happy.
But it's good to note that we're mainly on the same wavelength, I think, as an agency and as a Board,
regarding the points that the Governor is making.

So he was wanting to make sure that we were doing what we could to cut overhead. Well, if you recall,
the first bullet tonight of the COVID-- or the fiscal policy regarding COVID-- was, first consider reductions
in overhead. And we didn't just say that, I think, in multiple locations in the past several months. We've
actually acted on that.
So for example, we said, we don't want you just to do furlough staff. We'd like to see layoffs. And for that,
we've always urged a tiered approach so that the layoffs-- excuse me. We don't want you to just do
furloughs. We want you to do salary reductions.
And those salary reductions should really take effect at the upper end of the pay scale. And as tough as it
was to do that, and given that there was disagreement among the Board about how far we should go, we
still did that. We also explicitly prioritized in our service development for 2021 in the Pandemic 2 plan that
we would serve transit-dependent populations first and foremost. So we've done that.
We can provide the added detail on the CARES Act. And I believe our CEO is already engaging on and
helping to address issues of the timing of the layoffs. That may give us some added time to see what
happens with the stimulus, because that still is a big unknown.
So anyway, thanks for allowing me to weigh in on that. But I just want to recognize that piece and say, I
think it will be a good thing to start to provide more frequent and detailed updates to the Accountability
Committee as requested of us.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Cook. Anything else, Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, just two quick things. One of them is that Director Lewis talked some about
what's been referred to as the dashboard that she and Director Cook had looked at. And I think that is
something that we should move forward. That's something the Accountability Committee has looked at.
They've looked at the one that CDOT is using, which is a pretty expensive solution.
But Director Lewis mentioned a couple of others. And I know that they-- Director Cook, and Director
Lewis, and maybe others-- have looked at-- I think McKillop and others looked at some options. And I'd
like to see us move forward with that. And the other thing is just the CARES Act information that Melanie
Snyder was referring to-- figuring out a way to put that out more publicly, whether it's just putting it on a
website with a link that makes it obvious-- I think it would be worth doing as well. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
JEFF WALKER: Walker.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I would like-- hold on, Director Walker. I would like to thank our General
Counsel. We have all just received an email from her with the link for the CARES Act funding piece. And I
do think that, Director Walker, before I go to you, I have Director Cook. Director Cook?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yeah, thank you very much. And appreciate the second byte. I didn't respond to
Director Lewis's point. But I wanted to say I heartily agree and think we can move forward on one of those
pieces, whether it's that particular piece that we'd seen, or if it's a more broad transparency initiative, or if
we can look to our in-house resources. But I genuinely and honestly think we can do it sooner than later.
Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Thanks. Yeah, I'll echo what was said earlier. The CARES Act is a reimbursement
process. So the money is going where it's always gone. That money has helped us and a lot of other
agencies around the country that continue doing what they were doing already.

We have a budget. We follow the budget. It's not like money was going to new items that weren't included
in the budget.
Also, speaking of the budget, I haven't looked at the last year's budget or the years before that. But I'm
sure that all of the items-- that there's a pretty detailed line item in the budget that provides a great deal
about what we spend our money on. Maybe what we're looking at is moving that up towards the front of
the website or a better link.
I think most people just want to get from A to B to C to D and aren't really interested in where we spend
our money. That might be a small niche market there. But that line item of the budget is pretty interesting,
if one is inclined to read that-- if they're into that, like Kyle Clark might say.
And the last part, since Director Guissinger brought it up, is the Governance Committee. So the last
meeting I listened to-- I think it was Monday's meeting. There are a lot of different-- well, a couple of
different scenarios that were discussed. How much representation from elected officials? How much
representation from the public, Joe and Jane Smith?
So a couple of things. One, it seems to me that the Accountability Committee-- and maybe it extends
beyond that-- don't see the RTD Board as equals. And maybe Board members don't see themselves as
equals to city council members and state reps. And I think that might be part of why we're in this position.
I'm nicely situated in South Denver. I don't get a whole lot of phone calls about anything. But those areas
that aren't as well served as where I live, I'm sure you do, or those areas that had construction. But I think
that we-- or, I guess, you all-- if this Board still exists in this form, just need to recognize that you are
elected. And you do have the same amount of authority that any state legislator does, and any city
council member does, and even our federal representation.
The other part is I think they were trying to choose between-- when they were talking about models for
governance, it looked like they were looking at Salt Lake and La Metro. My thought was, it doesn't have to
be one or the other. It could be a mix where we have some elected and some appointed. And that would
satisfy both.
So those folks with a professional background could be appointed for specific purposes. Folks who just
ride the bus and-- not just, but the folks who ride the bus and are involved-- could satisfy that public
engagement, that public face, that public voice. That needs to be on the Board also.
So what I'm saying is my interpretation of the five or six meetings I've watched is that they're still trying to
figure out what the problem is. They feel that something's wrong, and they're trying to define it. I don't see
RTD operations as a problem. I think it's just a condition. That's just a fact, because some areas built
differently than Denver did.
But since we have this committee, I think that we should look at-- or they, that committee, should look at a
big range of things, and not necessarily follow something that's already been created. I don't know if
that's-- that's my input to Mr. Whitmore and Ms. Guissinger and, I guess, to the world. So anyway, that's
it. Thank you for your time.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. I would just like to say a couple of things. And the first one is I,
too, would like to take this opportunity to thank the Treasurer Guissinger and Director Whitmore for being
our representatives on this committee. I tried to listen in on as many as I can. But they have seven
meetings a month for this Accountability Committee. And that means that our staff is spending a lot of
time pulling together information that is being requested by the Accountability Committee and in

collaboration, or in sync, or however you want to say it with our two Board members who are our
representatives.
And I cannot thank all of you enough. I know that the Senior Leadership team has put in a lot of time. Our
staff has gone in and have done a lot of presentations. And I would like to thank the co-chairs of the
Accountability Committee for really allowing us to participate by providing factual information on
information that they need as they are determining these ideas that they're coming forward to take to the
Governor and the state legislature.
I have always thought that, at the beginning of this accountability, that this was really going to be our
ability to work in collaboration with the legislature, and the Governor's office, and our elected officials, and
representatives that were appointed to really move this agency forward for the good of the entire
community. And I think that researching everything really is merited in this but that-- look at everything.
Don't look at just two things. But really open up the door and take a look at a variety of opportunities and
options.
But I do think that their first report is due by the end of December. We're talking weeks away. And I'm
looking forward to what it is that they are going to be working on. And I want to thank Lynn and Troy for
being at the table and making sure that they have all the information that they need and that we are at the
table saying, the door's open. In transparency and in collaboration, we want to work together for the good
of everyone. Thank you. OK, now-SPEAKER 5: Madame Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
SPEAKER 5: I apologize. I wanted to make a comment to something that you mentioned. And I think it's
really important to highlight. And that was all of this information and transparency and all of the
information that our staff and FLT have given in their time to the Accountability Committee.
And I'm wondering if it wouldn't be helpful to add some more support by the additional information that
we're doing now in the Board Office that our Board staff provide in the training to our new Directors who
are coming, who spent six hours or six questions already. And perhaps if it hasn't already been done so,
that training information that we're imparting to the new directors also be provided to the entire
Accountability Committee. That's all.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's a great idea. Thank you. Thank you very much. OK, is there any new
business to come before the Board?
BOB BROOM: Madam Chair?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Broom, please.
BOB BROOM: Thank you. I wonder if we could, at our next meeting with CRL, get a briefing on the
Thornton water pipeline issue and its impact on the inline and on multifamily residential development and
ridership on inline. There was a recent article in the paper about that.
And I think not only is Thornton being adversely impacted, but so is RTD. And if that's the case, then we
need to talk to all of our elected friends up north and say, we're all in this together, and we should be
helping each other and not fighting over-- of course, water is always for fighting, I guess, and less used
for drinking. But I digress. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Did I hear someone else?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes, Madam Chair. Director Folska.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you. First of all, to Director Broom, there's a great book called Water Wars by
Vandana Shiva. It's an old book. You could get it in a used bookstore. But yeah, Water Wars-- that's all
over the place.
In the new business, I wanted to just mention and thank our SLT for their participation in the ADA
Sensitivity Awareness Training we did Monday morning. And I want to thank Director Lewis and Tommy
Silva for putting that together. It was remarkable.
I know we have an-- excuse me-- an upcoming one on the 19th. I think that's from 5:30 to 8:00. And I'm
excited for that to happen with the Board. But I was profoundly moved by the work that we did on Monday
morning. And I can't thank our staff as much as I'd like to, really, enough for being there. And that's it.
Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Any other new business?
NATALIE MENTEN: Menten.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please. Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah. I had a question on my mind for a while now, since somebody brought it to my
attention. And that is, in looking at RTD's potential to get more grants-- and I'm leaving that wide open,
not just, potentially, the CARES Act 2. But couldn't Ms. McKillop speak to whether the fleet spare ratio is a
consideration in getting grants?
And where would I get the best details for our summary before-- I believe that she knows our system and
where we stand with our fleets. It might even be part of our performance report as to the ratio itself. But
do either ratio mean that, potentially, CARES Act 2 or other grants would be off limits?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Madam Chair, this is Heather.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So the spare ratio is not directly tied to our formula grants or any other particular
grants as it relates to bus or facility grants. We do get that inquiry every time we have a triannual as to
what our spare ratio is. And our spare ratio will definitely be going up as we have reduced service to the
current levels, and then also in our January service. So our spare ratios will be going up.
My understanding in talking to FTA when it comes to NTD reporting and things like spare ratios-- we will
be able to determine what year of information we want to present to them moving forward, because they
understand that currently, throughout the country, the normal ratios that they're looking for, whether it be
spares or other things, probably are not going to happen right now due to the current COVID situation and
people addressing ridership issues in various ways. So that should not have an impact on grants that we
would receive, and particularly the spare ratio.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. Does that answer your question, Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: Is there a circular, or some kind of a guidance doc, a Google? I see a variety of
things. But perhaps Ms. McKillop might know the best doc-HEATHER MCKILLOP: I can look it up, but-NATALIE MENTEN: --for me to look at -HEATHER MCKILLOP: --I don't know Fred's on the phone or not. But Fred may have some better
information. But I can look it up and see if there's any FTA guidance on that. I think our last triannual, they
have a rule of thumb. But I don't know that there's particular guidance on the spare ratio. Maybe Fred
could answer that.

FRED WORTHAM: This is Fred Wortham, AGM of bus-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mr. Williams.
FRED WORTHAM: This is Fred Wortham, AGM of Bus Operations. Yes, there is particular guidance from
the FTA that primarily restricts the 20% spare ratio based upon your active fleet. However, they do allow
you to maintain a contingency fleet for emergency purposes that's not regulated. But those buses have to
be retired and past their end of life themselves. We do have a waiver into to the FTA, though, to actually
be able to exceed 20% spare ratio for this year until the Board actually adopts the long-term, mid-term
financial plan.
NATALIE MENTEN: Interesting. OK. Yeah, if I could get something-- if there's a good URL to keep on
hand, that would be great. It has come up. And I think I seem to remember that when I attended the
triannual audit review that was downstairs in the conference room A when we had that, if I remember
correctly. So anyway, that would be good. Thank you very much. That's it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Anything else? Hearing none, I will now entertain a motion to
adjourn.
TROY WHITMORE: So moved.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm sorry. Director Lewis, you're the movement?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And did I hear you, Director Whitmore, as the second?
TROY WHITMORE: Yes, indeed.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Anyone opposed? Hearing none, we are officially adjourned at 7:15
PM. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for participating. Have a good evening, and stay safe.
SPEAKER 6: Thanks, Angie.
SPEAKER 7: Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Bye.
