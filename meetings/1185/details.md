#### A. State Legislative Liaison Services Contract

It is recommended by the Regional Transportation District’s Executive Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into Contract No. 13DX001 with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs, which is an agreement for state legislative liaison services for one year (July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014) at a cost of $107,000 and four (4) additional one-year options to renew at prices specified in the Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors.

## III. June Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Anderson presented this agenda and asked AGM Bruce Abel to comment on it.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move the agenda forward as amended to include the state legislative liaison service contract and the revision to add route 16L to the August service changes to the full Board for approval on June 25, 2013.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Chair Anderson shared that we had invited the Sound Wave Signing Choir to our Board meeting to share their artistic gift and as a way to relax the meeting.

Bruce Abel shared that we expect CU President Bruce Benson and Honorable Mayor Hogan to the Board meeting.  They have asked to present first due to another engagement.

Director Daly apologized for his no vote to the I-225 alignment amendment at the committee meeting.  He will be a yes vote for this action item.

Pertaining to the action item, approval of I-225 alignment changes, Director Hoy read off what was his understanding of what CU president will say at the meeting. This had some specific language from CU to commit to a shuttle and at no cost to RTD.  Director Hoy raised the question if we should make an amendment to the Board report to reflect the specificity of the language that CU president will state.

Lots of conversation occurred around this question.  Director Hoy further clarified his concerns to say the language in the Board report says, “All changes will be made within the originally approved I-225 project budget.”  He would like to see budget changed to say contract.  The concern is if this alignment change results in use of the contingency fund, this is not acceptable.  There needs to be a responsible use of the taxpayers fund and RTD should not incur an additional cost because of this alignment change.  He believes there are others who would be more comfortable if this language was tightened up.

Director Bagley noted there are other costs and language that are part of the contract that we may know nothing about.  The original contract did not have a parking structure or shuttle.  He asked Director Hoy if he was concerned about some of the other changes.  Hoy stated his concerns were with the shuttle and any increase in cost associated with this alignment change.

Director Walker stated that in any construction projects, you really do not know what you are in for until you start digging.  Contingency funds are there to cover the unexpected and there is no way we can control for that.  Any obstacle along the way including a fallen star or anything could throw a monkey wrench in our estimated costs.

Chair Anderson concurred with this statement that all construction projects have contingencies to take care of the unexpected.  When you dig into dirt, you have no idea what you can find.  An example is on the West Corridor when we made that archaeological skeleton find.  This was a good find but could have easily caused us more delay and costs.

Scott Reed stated staff believes CU is giving us a clear commitment that this alignment change will not affect budget.  He is unaware if staff can say it will not impact the Kiewit contract.  However, it will remain within the budget for the I-225 corridor.

Director Bagley asked Director Hoy if he was concerned about the parking structure.  Director Hoy stated no.  Director Bagley suggested just have CU to put their commitment into a letter that they will fund the shuttle.

Director Walker stated that at the Board meeting Director Hoy could make that motion to amend it to include this specific language.

Director Bagley stated that for the record, he could not vote for such an amendment to add contract to this for reasons stated.

Chair Anderson expressed a concern also.  She recommended that Director Hoy visit with the legal department about making a motion to add contact to this.  The reason is contract has so many other elements to it that she is not sure what the ratifications could be.  She stated to Director Hoy that perhaps if he is having heartburn with the use of the contingencies, he might need to take some antacid.  Contingencies are part of any construction contract.

Pertaining to the August 2013 Service changes, Bruce Abel shared that staff has been actively engaged with the West corridor community on the 16L.  They had received a large number of petitions from riders on this route.  He provided a brief background of the route change;  Route 16 used to run from downtown to the Federal Center; Route 16L ran from downtown to Golden with select stops along the way; with the changes implemented in April, route 16L went away and route 16 was extended into Golden.  They have met with the 9-5 advocacy group representative Zoe, Directors Menten and Rivera-Malpiede.   They believe they have struck a compromise that is doable and these groups can agree.  They will reinstate the 16L; they will terminate the 16 at the Federal Center; on weekends and at night, the 16 will extend into Golden.  They believe they can affect these changes with minimal or no additional costs in terms of budget impacts.  Bruce Abel stated that Zoe felt this could be a win and instead of having busloads of people on Tuesday to testify against the changes, she will be here to represent the group with a thank you for this consideration.

Director Menten commented both the 9 to 5 group and the physically disabled had been affected by the proposed changes; she believes the new change will address both of their concerns.  She also stated they will plan to cancel their press conference they had scheduled prior to the Board meeting.

Director Bagley asked Bruce Abel for assurances this will not have a budgetary impact.  Bruce Abel indicated they are working the numbers but do not anticipate any significant change. It should be a wash.

Chair Anderson thanked Director Menten for all her hard work on this and in factoring a solution.

## VII. Other Matters

Director Walker shared that he had participated in the DUS tour with CDOT and asked at what point in the Board meeting he could share feedback.  Paula Perdue stated the appropriate place will be new business.

Director Bagley stated that he had several items for other matter:

- Director Bagley passed out two drawings.  He stated that these were part of a presentation made by Tom Clark in a meeting to the Southeast group a couple of weeks ago.  These maps show the projected population growth by quadrants and projected annual employment.  He noted the highest projected population growth to be in the northeast and the highest employment growth to be in the northeast and the southeast.  He would like to invite Tom Clark to one of our meetings to share parts of his presentation.  Chair Anderson felt this was good information but she was trying to figure out how it ties into the overall scheme of things.  They will try to figure out when it might be appropriate to invite Tom Clark to one of our meetings.

- Director Bagley recommended that the Board adopt a policy that requires travel trip reports when Board members travel.  Director Walker asked what would be the consequences if they did not provide one. Director Bagley expressed that the Board members should be accountable for the expenditure of funds for their travel and these trip reports will show the benefits from the travel.  For example, Board members traveling to Washington D.C. visit with their Congressional leadership as well as other federal officials to petition for money.  Because of these efforts and others, RTD was awarded the 1.03B FFGA, the $308M grant and other funding.  This will provide a public record in the event someone wants to know the value from these trips.

Director Daly added that these reports should speak to what was learned on the trips and how it benefited the district.

Paula Perdue shared that we have received about five reports this far.  These reports have been placed in the respective Board member’s travel file. However, as she has read these reports, she thinks there is information included in these reports that should be shared with all Board members.

The committee agreed that sharing of these reports may be a good idea.  They also concluded that while it is a good idea if everyone provided a travel report, they could only encourage Board members to do so.

Director Hoy suggested that as we update our current policy, we could add the language to encourage Board members to provide travel reports.

- Director Bagley would like to have Board members express the reasons for a no-vote.  Director Hoy concurred it would make flow of information easier and help Board members to understand the reasons why a fellow Board member voted no on an issue.  Chair Anderson stated this is part of the Board dynamics.  Hopefully, Board members will want to share their concerns but this is something that cannot be forced.

- Director Bagley expressed concern of Board members making statements outside of RTD approved activities. When speaking, it is important for Board members to state this is their personal opinion and does not reflect the opinion of the Board.  When a Board position has been finalized, Board members need to speak to that position.

Director Walker shared that in some previous conversation around this subject, he understands from Marla Lien that the official Board position is what is voted on.

Chair Anderson pointed to a meeting at the state legislature where she feels Director Menten handled this situation well in stating this is my opinion and does not reflect the opinion of the Board.

- June 19 Town Hall Meeting—Chair Anderson indicated it was a good town hall meeting but with one snafu—the publishing of the wrong call in number.  She asked AGM Scott Reed to provide an update on this issue.  Scott Reed indicated this was a successful town hall meeting where contacts were made to over 48,000 household and 5,300 participated.  This is a good ratio.  Unfortunately, the telephone number got transposed.  When they discovered the error, they immediately tweeted, used social media, etc. to get the corrected number out there. Staff is very sorry for this error.  Director Hoy responded that he had gotten over 50 calls related to this issue.

Scott Reed commented they have scheduled another town hall meeting for next Thursday, June 27 so hopefully the people who were not able to call in will be able to do so next Thursday.  He explained there is some misperception that everyone calling in will be able to speak. This is not necessarily true.  The call in number is intended to be a supplement.  They do plan to make some adjustments for the next Thursday meeting.  They will make sure people know of follow-up numbers they can contact; RTD will be posting this on their website and doing continuous improvement with this tool.

Director Bagley inquired who were the Directors and elected officials involved in this town hall.  Directors Hoy, Sisk, Lubow, Anderson participated along with Pat Quinn, Phil Greenwood, Chris Quinn and Natalie Irving.  Unfortunately, some of the stakeholders such as Honorable Mayor Nancy McNally had the wrong number and were unable to call in.  Director Hoy stated that Chair Anderson said it best “it appears we may have offended the very people that we were trying to reach.”

Chair Anderson commented that from the polling she noted two things.  Pertaining to the question, how do you want to receive information, the overwhelming number prefers e-mail.  Also, to the question what do you want from public transit, the most popular response was frequent service and speed.

Director Bagley said this could be part of a lesson learned as we utilize more town hall meetings.

## VIII. Adjourn

The meeting adjourned at 1:30 p.m.
