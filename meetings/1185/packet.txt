BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 12, 2013

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: June 20, 2013

Subject:

State Legislative Liaison Services Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Regional Transportation District’s Executive Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into Contract No. 13DX001 with
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs, which is an agreement for state legislative liaison services for one
year (July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014) at a cost of $107,000 and four (4) additional one-year
options to renew at prices specified in the Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the
Board of Directors.
BACKGROUND
In April 2013, RTD issued a competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) for State Legislative Liaison
Services. The RFP was broadly advertised in The Denver Post and the lobbying trade publication—The
Colorado Statesman—plus being sent to many current lobbying firms. One team—the incumbent
Brandeberry~McKenna group—responded to this request. After reviewing the proposal, the Executive
Committee is recommending the award of this contract to Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs as our
legislative liaison with the legislative and executive branches of the state of Colorado. This team has
broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns, as well as having extensive experience in handling RTD
issues at the state capitol. The proposal was submitted for the period of July 1, 2013 through June 30,
2014, with the potential for four (4) one-year option periods. The proposed costs reflect a negligible
increase, less than five percent per year, which is within an acceptable range for increased labor and
overhead expenses. The Government Relations Committee will make annual recommendations to the
Board of Directors near the end of each contract period regarding the exercise of future option periods.
DISCUSSION
The state lobbying team provides guidance and direction for the RTD Board of Directors and staff in
their relationships with the General Assembly members. Constant monitoring of the activities within
the General Assembly and the Executive Office of the state of Colorado is required, and RTD’s
interests must be conveyed to appropriate legislators, including testifying before certain committees.
Advice and assistance in drafting legislation are also provided by the lobbying team. When RTD has
had legislation before the General Assembly, Brandeberry~McKenna has done an excellent job of
making certain that these bills pass and become part of the Colorado statutes.
As part of the services, frequent contact is made with RTD staff and board members regarding various
bills in the legislature; written summary reports are issued on a weekly basis during the legislative
session; and status reports are given at the Government Relations Committee meetings while the
General Assembly is in session and as deemed necessary thereafter.

Packet Pg. 8

1.2.A

ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into a contract for state legislative liaison
services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs, for the initial year July 1, 2013 through June
30, 2014 on Contract No. 13DX001, at a first-year cost of $107,000.
2. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not accept the recommendation by the Executive
Committee that authorizes the General Manager to enter into a contract to execute the state
legislative liaison services one-year contract. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to
interested parties, interviews conducted, and a different state lobbying firm could possibly be
selected by the Government Relations Committee and retained. This action is not recommended
because it is the consensus of the Executive Committee to recommend to the Board the selection
of the Brandeberry~McKenna team.
3. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not retain the services of a state legislative liaison
firm. This action is not recommended because it would put RTD in the position of facing
contentious and potentially harmful legislative issues with no direct legislative liaison services. It
was determined by the Executive Committee that the Brandeberry~McKenna team has been very
effective in pursuing the RTD state legislative agenda and will continue to represent RTD’s
interests very well in the future. This team is very familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.

Approval of 2013 Amended Budget

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2013 to amend and appropriate funds for the proposed 2013
Amended Budget, to increase the appropriation by $13.302 million to $1,584.563 million as detailed
below in the overview of the 2013 Amended Budget, and to decrease the appropriation of Capital
Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by $247.879 million to $1,003.434 million due to
primarily planned expenditures.

2.11.A

BACKGROUND
The purpose of this memorandum is to request an amendment to the 2013 Adopted Budget. This
amendment will account for capital carryforward adjustments from 2012 to 2013. The amendment also
will detail other adjustments to the capital budget and adjustments to the operating and administrative
budget.
DISCUSSION
Overview of the 2013 Budget Amendment
The total proposed appropriation for the 2013 Amended Budget and the changes from the 2013
Adopted Budget are summarized in the first set of tables above.
2013 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $18.2 million from the 2013 Adopted Budget. This increase consists of $17.2 million on the
Base System and $3.3 million in FasTracks Project/Construction, offset by a decrease of $2.3 million on
FasTracks Operations (West Line). Of the total increase, $5.5 million is attributed to previously
approved transfers. On the Base System, the true increase to operating expenses is less than 1% net of
previously approved transfers, the FISA contribution, and one-time expenses.
Shown in detail on the attached Amendment A, net changes are summarized below.
Base System
Bus Operations
 Net decrease of $0.321 million from diesel lock savings offset by August runboard increase
Rail Operations
 Net increase of $1.0 million for increases in system traction power, traction power and repair parts
transferred from West Line net of cost allocation, and staff additions for signal/traction power
maintainers and supervisors in conjunction with rail line expansion
Private Carrier Operations
 Net increase of $1.4 million from shortfall in the original fuel budget, additional BroncosRide service,
and incentive payments to private carriers

 Net decrease of $0.875 million from favorable adjustment to security contracts cost, security costs

Interest Expense
Interest expense is projected to increase $19.9 million on a combined basis. Of the increase, Base
system interest is projected to increase $5.3 million due to issuance of COP debt in 2013 to finance
replacement and expansion of the bus fleet. FasTracks interest expense is projected to increase $14.6
million due to restructuring of interest payments from sales tax revenue bond refinancing in 2013, which
includes non-cash amortization of expenditures on prior debt carried forward. Capitalized interest is
projected to remain stable.
2013 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects a decrease of $15.7 million to the
2013 Adopted Budget. These changes result from program changes that have occurred since the 2013
Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
FasTracks
FasTracks new capital had a decrease of $20.7 million due to alignment of corridor funding with updated
timing, adjustments for grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and completion of projects. Please see
Attachment B for detail.
Base System
New capital expenditures increased $5.0 million on the Base System. Please see Attachment B for
detail.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2013 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/12 were used to compute the
estimate of the carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of the adoption of
the annual budget.
Previously approved capital carryforward has been decreased by $247.9 million from the 2013 Adopted
Budget to reflect fourth quarter 2012 actual expenditures, transfers to reclassify certain capital projects
as expense projects, previously approved transfers, completion of projects, and project scope changes.
The FasTracks portion was a decrease of $229.3 million and the Base System decrease was $18.5
million. Please see Attachment C for detail.

Revenue Changes
Revenues are projected to increase $19.0 million on a combined basis.
 Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $8.8 million based on the CU-Leeds School
June forecast of 3.7% vs. 4.2% in the Adopted Budget from CU-Leeds earlier forecast.

Packet Pg. 15

2.11.A






Federal grant revenues, including operating grants, capital grants, capital maintenance, FASTER
grants, CMAQ grants, and other grants are projected to increase $22.8 million over amounts
projected in the 2013 Adopted Budget. This reflects increasing allocations in formula grant
appropriations over the 2013 Adopted Budget and some new programs in 2013 as well as
increases in CMAQ capital grants for FasTracks.
Fare revenue is projected to remain flat in the Amended Budget over the Adopted Budget based
on current year actuals.
Other income is projected to increase $4.3 million due primarily to sale of the Civic Center air
rights.

Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance

The Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to decrease $7.8 million from the Adopted Budget
to $23.0 million reflecting amended budget increases, year-end accruals and the net pension obligation.

FasTracks Contingency Reserve
The proposed 2013 Amended Budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve at a balance of $30 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and is used to fund any
changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption of the annual
budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the
FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks
Future Construction Reserve. The Reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010 and remains at
that level in both this Amended Budget and the 2013 Adopted Budget.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2013 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and further amended on 1/1/93, 5/15/08 and
4/1/10. The policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000
require prior approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2013 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.

Fund Balance Policy

Packet Pg. 16

2.11.A

The proposed 2013 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2013 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and Unrestricted Year-End Fund
balance in the District's working capital.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of principal are treated
as expenditures, and (2) depreciation and gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are
excluded.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2013 Budget to reflect the capital project changes and the adjustments to the operating
budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2013 Budget and amend the budget with
revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2013 Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2013 Adopted Budget does
not reflect the capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments, and material changes to
the operating and administrative budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 5, 2013

From:

Richard Clarke Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 31, 2013

Board Meeting Date: June 20, 2013

Subject:

North Metro Segment 2, Phase 1
Commuter Rail Project Property Acquisition

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro
Segment 2 (Stock Show to 72nd Avenue), Phase 1 Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed
with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General Manager or
designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to consummate real property transactions.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the successful proposer for the construction of the
North Metro Segment 2, Phase 1 Commuter Rail Project the right of way necessary for the construction
of the project. Properties identified to be acquired in the North Metro Segment 1, Phase 1 were certified
by passage of Resolution No. 11 Series of 2011 in September 2011. Property needs will be identified
and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition process. This process begins
with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under eminent domain law.
Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of all property identified, subject to any modifications or
additions required by the contractor and/or construction activities.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or Property Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition in this action is included in the North Metro budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties
as necessary for construction of the North Metro Segment 2 (Stock Show to 72nd Avenue), Phase
1 Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state
eminent domain law and to provide the General Manager or designee with authority to enter into
all contracts necessary to consummate real property transactions.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ___ SERIES OF 2013
NORTH METRO SEGMENT 2, PHASE 1 COMMUTER RAIL PROJECT
PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the North Metro Segment 1 Commuter
Rail Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed that attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list
the property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation
to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the
authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it
deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the
power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the North
Metro Segment 2, Phase 1 Commuter Rail Project, although financially compensated according
to the law, makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by
others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that
there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in
furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are for the benefit of the public
health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as the Board’s
delagatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.

Packet Pg. 35

2.12.B

The Board directs that the RTD delagatees should negotiate in good faith for the
acquisition of the property and if the delagatee is unable to acquire any property through good
faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power
of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property
owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of
owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties
as soon as permitted by law.
The Board directs that the General Manager or delegatee shall have the authority to enter
into all contracts necessary to consummate real property transactions.
Made and adopted this ___ day of _________________, 2013.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 6, 2013

From:

Richard Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

June 5, 2013

Board Meeting Date: June 20, 2013

Subject:

Easement for Brainard Drive Relocation Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive
drainage easement over 10,881 square feet (0.249 acres), more or less in Section 28, Township 1
South, Range 69 West, City and County of Broomfield, State of Colorado.
BACKGROUND
In 1997, RTD acquired property for future transit facilities in the vicinity of the interchange of US 36 and
96th Street in the city limits of Broomfield. The City of Broomfield held an option on approximately 56
acres of vacant land and lacked sufficient available funding to exercise the option prior to its expiration
in late 1997. RTD desired to secure a portion of the property, at that time below the current market
value and pursuant to an IGA between RTD and the City of Broomfield, RTD exercised the option on the
56 acres. The City of Broomfield had the right to purchase up to 46 acres of the land from RTD at the
original option price prior to the end of 2002. RTD retained 10 acres for future development of a transit
center/park-n-Ride facility. On the property retained by RTD, the Flatiron park-n-Ride was developed.
DISCUSSION
The City and County of Broomfield will acquire a permanent easement from RTD for drainage. The
Colorado Department of Transportation, BNSF and Broomfield desire to relocate the BNSF siding tracks
in Broomfield so that the siding tracks will no longer cross two roadway intersections. In order to do
this, Broomfield must relocate the location where Brainard Drive connects to Midway Boulevard. This is
generally shown on the attached graphic.
The value of the proposed easement has been determined by CDOT and the City and County to be 90%
of the fee value of $2.00 per square foot or $19,586 for the 10,881 square foot easement.
Valuation was based on appraisal work done by Douglas P. Agne, MAI of Pinnacle Evaluation. His
appraisal of adjacent property to the north of the RTD parcel conclude land valuation at $0.55 per
square foot as but also valued the property at $1.33 per square foot if sold for transit oriented
development. The Broomfield City council approved a Purchase and Sale Agreement of the adjacent
north five acres at their April 23, 2013 meeting at $1.00 per square foot.
The grant of this easement will not preclude future development and will in fact enhance future access
to the RTD parcel.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive $19,586 in compensation for the easement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all

Packet Pg. 44

2.12.C

documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive drainage easement over 10,881 square feet (0.249
acres), more or less in Section 28, Township 1 South, Range 69 West, City and County of

Approval of I-225 Alignment Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve a change
in alignment and station location on the I-225 corridor. This change would move the alignment along
Montview Avenue at the Anschutz/ Fitzsimons Medical Campus to a new alignment in the general
vicinity along Fitzsimons Parkway. The station location will also change from Montview to along
Fitzsimons Parkway. The exact location will be defined as part of a collaborative effort with the City of
Aurora, the University of Colorado stakeholders as well as public input, and also to include a
transportation plan that will accommodate the needs of persons who are transit dependent to access the
Anschutz Campus. A general depiction of the changes is shown in Exhibit 1.
All changes will be made within the originally approved I-225 Project budget.
BACKGROUND
The I-225 corridor is a major component of the FasTracks plan. On October 20, 2009, the Board of
Directors approved the I-225 Environmental Evaluation (EE), which defined the project scope, alignment,
station locations and characteristics, impacts and mitigations. The I-225 EE was a collaborative effort
among all the corridor stakeholders including the City of Aurora and the stakeholders on the
Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Campus. The preferred alignment identified in the EE was the basis for an
unsolicited proposal and subsequent RFP. On July 24, 2012, the Board approved a design-build contract
for the construction of this corridor.
DISCUSSION
As shown on Exhibit 1, part of the alignment through the Anschutz/Fitzsimons Campus travels along
Montview Avenue. Agreements with the City of Aurora and the Fitzsimons Redevelopment Authority
(FRA) required that a Metro District reconstruct the Montview roadway to accommodate a corridor for
the I-225 light rail line and future traffic and development needs. However, funding by the third party
for this construction is not in place and the imminent construction of light rail places new urgency on
reconstructing the Montview roadway. LRT speeds along Montview will be slow (approximately 15
mph), governed by traffic signals and with up to six at-grade crossings.
The University of Colorado and FRA have major plans to make Fitzsimons a preeminent, international
medical research facility. This development has the potential to be a major economic driver for the
region.
The University of Colorado staff has raised concerns about the impacts of electromagnetic interference
(EMI) and vibration and the ability to develop the site to potential. We have learned that medical
research and technology has become increasingly sophisticated and highly sensitive to environmental
influences. EMI generated from the LRT trains may interfere with the sensitive equipment forcing it to
be located far from Montview. Similarly vibration from the trains can interfere with the operation of this
sensitive equipment. Similar mitigation efforts by other transit agencies for EMI and vibration adjacent

Packet Pg. 51

2.13.A

to existing medical research facilities are extremely expensive, with no assurance that they will achieve
the desired mitigation.
The understanding of the impacts of electric trains on adjacent medical facilities has been rapidly
developing in the past few years. Seattle and Minneapolis transit systems recently had to agree to
elaborate mitigation. Some of the mitigations they are using have never been tried in actual service and
their agreements require extensive ongoing monitoring and additional mitigation or adjustments if the
measures do not achieve their desired results.
Potential mitigations for EMI include precisely located underground power feeder system. A floating slab
(which is a very large concrete slab located under the trackway and resting on rubberized pads or
springs) would be applied to reduce low frequency vibration from the trains. The cost of these
mitigations along with delay costs and asbestos removal in Montview is estimated at approximately $58$60 million. A schedule delay of one to two years for the project, if the alignment were to remain on
Montview would also be incurred due to the re-design, additional work and time to negotiate a final
agreement.
The University of Colorado does not wish to be in an uncompetitive situation regarding its ability to
attract national and international medical research to its campus.
Therefore, the University of Colorado sent a letter (Exhibit 2) requesting that RTD move the alignment
from Montview to an alternative site along Fitzsimons Parkway. This relocation will eliminate their
concerns. Although there may be some initial decrease of ridership due to the station move, the letter
states that CU is planning to take measures that enhance ridership including the use of shuttles from the
Fitzsimons Parkway station, a parking garage and development around the station.
An update to the Environmental Evaluation would be performed if the Board approves this change. The
update would include coordination with affected stakeholders and a public involvement process. The
updated EE would identify any environmental challenges and mitigations required for this new alignment.
To avoid additional costs, design and construction of certain elements can proceed during the
environmental process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The final cost for the change in alignment to Fitzsimons Parkway will be developed as design progresses.
The cost will be within the corridor budget and will not require funds from other parts of FasTracks or
RTD’s budget. The cost of the recommended alignment could be less than that for the original
alignment along Montview.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve a change in alignment and station location on the I-225 corridor. This
change would move the alignment along Montview Avenue at the Anschutz/ Fitzsimons Medical
Campus to a new alignment in the general vicinity along Fitzsimons Parkway. The station location
will also change from Montview to along Fitzsimons Parkway. The exact location will be defined as
part of a collaborative effort with the City of Aurora, the University of Colorado stakeholders as well
as public input, and also to include a transportation plan that will accommodate the needs of persons
who are transit dependent to access the Anschutz Campus. A general depiction of the changes is
shown in Exhibit 1.

Packet Pg. 52

2.13.A

All changes will be made within the originally approved I-225 Project budget.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Instead leave the alignment along Montview and build the
appropriate mitigations required by the University of Colorado. This is not recommended because the
additional cost($58-$60 million) is not in the project budget, a schedule delay of one to two years
will result and there is no assurance that the mitigations will be effective, putting the medical
campus in a potential non-competitive situation (nationally and internationally) and RTD at risk for
further mitigation efforts.
3. Do not accept the recommend action. Instead continue to negotiate with the University of Colorado
to reduce the mitigations required. This is not recommended as there is no certainty as to the
timeframe or success of these negotiations. The project would need to be stopped through this area,
causing a significant cost and schedule delay while negotiations continue for an undetermined
amount of time.

Board Report August 2013 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
the proposed August 2013 Service Change as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an
annualized cost increase of $1,108,900 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee
to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose services are impacted by
these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. For this year we will continue adjusting
services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a
whole while also focusing attention on the recent implementation of the West Corridor Light Rail Service
and the associated bus service changes. Routine service changes not associated with or included in the
West Corridor Service Plan are necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the
appropriate level of service according to customer demand while we will also need to monitor customer
response to the implementation of West Corridor bus and rail service and propose adjustments as
appropriate.
The proposed August 2013 Service Changes reflect the continued budgetary challenges faced by RTD.
The guiding principles for service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are proposed to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent changes proposed to the service
changes initially proposed to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of August 2013 service
changes:

Route 6 – East 6th Ave/North Pecos
Extend 8:00am weekday westbound trip from 8th/Colorado to instead originate at
Centrepoint & Sable Transfer Center at 7:21am. Relieves overloads on the following trip
at 7:36am from Centrepoint & Sable. The cost is estimated to be $10,300 annualized
Route 9 – West Tenth Avenue
School trippers would be discontinued due to parallel Light Rail service. (Offset against
part of cost of Route 100W trippers added.)
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Schedule adjustments and add an additional trip eastbound to address passenger
overloads.
The cost is estimated to be $6,900
Route 12 – Downing/N Washington
Add 3:20pm northbound trip from Downing/Colfax to 106th/Melody, relieving overloads
on the following trip. Cost impact estimated at $8,300 annualized.
Route 14 – West Florida
It is proposed to extend the weekday trip that (in April) starts at Wadsworth/West
Arkansas at 6:39 a.m. to instead begin service at Lakewood Commons at 6:24 a.m.
Estimated cost are projected to be $2,600 annualized
Route 16 – West Colfax
Peak and midday overloads are occurring at a level which clearly exceeds RTD service
standards. These overloads occur on a regular basis on the link between Decatur-Federal
Station and the Civic Center. This segment carries a heavy burden of social services and
court traffic throughout the day, with space needed for disabled customers and strollers or
walkers. West between Decatur-Federal Station and Wadsworth, peak period overloads
are occurring, but more data is needed in order to place extra trips.
RTD will add shuttle trips as soon as possible (June 9, 2013) to lead every Route 16 trip
between Decatur-Federal and the 10th/Broadway route terminal on weekdays between the
hours of 6:15 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. This will not only add back capacity, but also improve
W-Line connections for Civic Center with matching headways, making the use of Light Rail
more practical for trips west of Federal.
Proposed for August runboard:
It is proposed to extend peak period extra service to the Zephyr Street terminal
(Wadsworth Blvd.) and to extend one additional AM trip from Golden to Oak Station and
one additional PM trip from Oak Station to Golden. Projected cost impacts for this proposal
total $840,000 and 8 peak buses, including requirements for the Golden trip extensions.

Route 17 – Red Rocks College
With the extension to Indiana Street, the span of service that was appropriate for college
hours begins too late for most commuting purposes. It is proposed to add a round-trip
from Federal Center Station to Indiana Street on weekdays at 5:37 a.m. Estimated
weekday cost $5,200 annualized weekday
Route 21 – Evans Avenue
Add 7:21am westbound trip from Centrepoint & Sable to Evans Station. Relieves
overloads on both the 7:06am and 7:36am westbound trips. Weekday cost impact
estimated at $15,500
Route 46 – Cherry Creek/Dahlia/DTC
Running time analysis and schedule adjustments.
No cost impacts anticipated
Route 76 – Wadsworth Crosstown
Route 225 – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline
Cut weekday routing of the Route 76 back from Lafayette to US 36 & Broomfield PnR.
Replace current Route 76 service with Route 225 extension from Broomfield to Lafayette
PnR. Extend Route 225 to US 36 & Broomfield PnR from Lafayette PnR, hourly headway,
weekday only, to replace current Route 76 segment. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 87X –South Wadsworth Express
The former Route 87 Express had three trips into CCS in the morning peak and three trips
out from CCS in the afternoon peak. It averaged 128 boardings. The portion of the route
west of Wadsworth near Hampden was replaced by Route 30Ltd, which has twice as long
a span of service and a one-seat ride to the center of Downtown, as well as good transfer
connections to the Union Station and Civic Center. Although slower than Route 87X, that
portion of the change has received little criticism.
It is proposed to restore the route on its former alignment, with the exception of the
segment south of Yale Avenue, which was replaced by Route 30Ltd. That portion would
be replaced by running on Wadsworth to and from the Wadsworth & Hampden Park-nRide.
Requirements for restoring the route, based on the August 2012 Service Recap with
interlines, rounded up to 2 peak buses and $82,800 annualized.
Route 88 – Thornton/Commerce City/Stapleton
Schedule adjustments. No cost anticipated

Route 100 – Kipling Crosstown
A deviation from the current route on Quail Street is proposed to bring service closer to
the new Jefferson County Public Health location at 645 Parfet Street. Both northbound
and southbound buses would loop from Quail & Eighth via West Eighth Avenue, Parfet
Street, West Sixth Avenue Access Road and Quail Street. A minor adjustment would be
made in the Route 100W – North Kipling school tripper service to mesh with this change.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 100X – South Kipling Express
The former Route 100X had four trips into Civic Center Station (CCS) in the morning peak
and five trips out from CCS in the afternoon peak. It averaged 191 boardings. Its service
pattern was replicated by the Route 100Ltd at all of the neighborhood walk-on stops made
by Route 100X, as well as at the Ken Caryl Park-n-Ride. Route 100Ltd is heavily interlined
and would require time changes for conversion to Route 100X.
In order to maintain connectivity for non-Civic Center Station bound riders, it is proposed
to re-create Route 100X via the Route 100Ltd alignment between Ken Caryl Park-n-Ride
and Federal Center Station, and via the Regional routes alignment between Federal Center
Station and Civic Center, with a short dwell at Federal Center Station (FCS). Minor
schedule adjustments would be made. The fifth (final) trip in the evening would operate
between FCS and Ken Caryl and the reverse peak trips would also operate only between
FCS and Ken Caryl and return.
Requirements for revising the route, incremental to the current costs for Route 100Ltd and
for special service that is replacing Route KC, are estimated at 1 peak bus and 6 weekday
hours. Gate assignments would be adjusted at Federal Center Station. The newly
implemented Route CS – Civic Center Station to Federal Center Station short turns trips
would be reduced where replaced by Route 100X. Annualized weekday cost estimated to
be $76,400
Route 116X – South Simms Express
The reinstated Route 116X would be maintained as restored; with further modification
anticipated in January 2014, when Route 116Ltd and the Green Mountain call-n-Ride
service can be analyzed. The cost of reinstating this service is estimated at $76,400
annualized.
Route 120X – Thornton/Wagon Road Express
It is proposed to add a SB AM trip from Thornton Park-n-Ride at about 8:40am, to alleviate
the consistent 20+ passenger overloads on the current 8:45am SB trip. Weekday cost
impact estimated to be $12,700.
Route 121 – Peoria Street
Reduce peak frequency between Nine Mile Station and Ulster/Tufts from every 15 to every
30 minutes. Ridership on peak direction trips averages between 2 and 3 passengers/trip.
Savings = 5.0 hours.

Add 1:37pm and 2:07pm northbound trips from Nine Mile, and 1:45pm southbound trip
from Montbello, to relieve standing loads on current 30 minute midday frequency. Cost:
3.7 hours weekday.
Anticipated weekday savings estimated to be $13,400 annualized
Route 130 – Yale/Buckley
Modify service through Heather Gardens as follows:
Weekdays southbound, service will operate via Yale and Peoria to Nine Mile Station during
the AM peak and evenings after 7:00pm. Service will operate via Heather Gardens midday
and PM peak.
Weekdays northbound, service will operate via Heather Gardens during the AM peak and
midday, and via Peoria and Yale during the PM peak and evenings.
All Saturday, Sunday, and holiday service will operate via Yale and Peoria.
No cost impact anticipated.
Route 131 – Iliff
Reroute off of Vaughn Way between Iliff and Yale, use Abilene instead.
neighborhood impact on Vaughn Way, will better serve future Iliff LRT Station.
No cost impact anticipated.

Route 133 – Hampden/Tower
Add 4:41am southbound trip from Centrepoint/Sable (feeds H-Line train at 5:23am), and
add 4:55am and 5:25am northbound trips from Nine Mile (this productive route – 35
boardings/hour - does not start northbound service until nearly 6:00am currently).
Weekday cost impacts estimated to be $23,800 annualized.
Route 153 – Chambers Road
Extend northbound evening service one hour later to 11:42pm from Arapahoe Crossing.
Cost impacts estimated to be $14,500 annualized.
Route 204 – Table Mesa/Moorhead/North 19th
Running time adjustment; remove Vassar loop. No additional cost impact anticipated
Route 209 – CU/Table Mesa PnR
Re-route back through CU campus, via clockwise routing along Regent and Colorado to
alleviate overloads occurring on Route Stampede; move south-end layover to Manhattan
Circle, due to City of Boulder installation of a traffic signal at South Boulder Road.

current BOLT block 27 pull-out. Weekday annualized cost estimated to be $5,300
Routes CV/CS/CX – Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver
It is expected that the new Pine Junction Park-n-Ride will be opened during this Fall.
Minor schedule adjustments will be made in preparation for this change. Weekday cost
impact estimated to be $5,900 annualized.
Route DASH – Boulder/Lafayette via Louisville
The city of Boulder is installing a traffic signal at South Boulder Road and Manhattan Circle
which will allow RTD to move the layover/recovery for Route Dash short-turn trips back to
the former location. It is therefore proposed to change the current layover from Table
Mesa PnR back to Manhattan Circle, for the DASH short-turn trips.
No cost impact anticipated
Route JUMP – Boulder/Lafayette via Arapahoe
It is proposed to remove the excess layover at Erie Community Center in the mid-day and
balance the current trips at Lafayette PnR, WB to ½ hour frequency; will result in some
mid-day schedule adjustments. No resource impact anticipated.
Route KC – Ken Caryl/FC/Denver
This service has been cancelled in favor of operating reinstated service on the Route 116X
– South Simms Express. The annualized savings of $70,300 would be used to operate the
6 weekday trips (3 in each peak period) on the Route 116X.
Route SKIP – Broadway
It is proposed to add one school tripper in the PM from Fairview High School to
Broadway/Walnut at 3:29pm (or as warranted by the BVSD bell-times) due to overloads on
the current 3:25pm trip. Additionally it is proposed that schedule adjustments be made to
the weekday afternoon/evening peak period. Cost impacts include an additional PM bus
and $50,000 annualized.
W-Line Call-n-Rides: Belmar, Golden and Green Mountain:
With the opening of the West Line Light Rail, three new Call-n-Rides began operations on
April 27, 2013. As with all new services, actual operations may require adjustments after
a few months in operation. Adjustments will be made based on customer travel patterns
and customer requests. There should be no additional costs associated with these
modifications except for the Golden Call-n-Ride. Annual weekday cost: $8,025.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 12, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

June 11, 2013

Board Meeting Date: June 20, 2013

Subject:

Approval for Increase in Contract Not-toExceed Amount for Smart Card Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to increase the current contract not-to-exceed amount
by $1,719,512.81 with Xerox, Inc. (Formerly ACS Transportation Solutions, Inc.). The total new
contract not-to-exceed amount is $17,381,470.23.
BACKGROUND
The Smart Card Implementation transitioned EcoPass, CollegePass, and NeighborhoodPass programs
from cards with decals to electronic smart cards this past January, 2013. The next phase of the
Smart Card Program is to transition all other retail pass products to stored value on MyRide Smart
Cards. RTD Retail Sales locations will begin selling the MyRide products in fall of 2013, while the
retail network including King Soopers, Safeway and other retailers will begin selling the MyRide
Products in spring of 2014.
As the Smart Card Program progresses, additional equipment is required to provide for program and
FasTracks advances, enhancements and growth. Therefore additional funds are needed to acquire
and install a variety of equipment including:










Installation of platform validators at existing rail stations
Enhancements to the handheld smart media readers used by Fare Enforcement
Integration costs to allow the CAD/AVL driver display to provide Smart Card information
(eliminating the need for two driver displays)
Modification of the mounting device on buses ensuring the bus validator is properly positioned
for riders
Maintenance terminals for maintaining all Smart Media validators at light rail locations
Purchase of an additional Smart Media Encoder to provide redundancy needed at the
Customer Service Center for producing cards.
Purchase of additional smart media cards to meet the needs of current EcoPass and
CollegePass holders through the end of 2013
Purchase of additional Smart Media Validators over the course of several years to meet
FasTracks expansion needs.
Additional web portal enhancements to improve customer experience and management of
their own MyRide card.

DISCUSSION
This equipment will ensure customers are provided convenient access to station platform validators as
RTD’s use of the Smart Media increases. Additionally, the maintenance equipment and encoding
equipment will allow RTD to improve customer service by more expediently addressing issues and
producing cards.

This equipment must be purchased by Xerox, Inc. for multiple reasons:




The equipment is unique to the Xerox/RTD installed systems and it would be extremely
difficult if not impossible to acquire from other vendors.
The card purchase addresses demands for this year and future card purchases will be
procured in an open competition.
Xerox has developed the software for this specific equipment being used at transit agencies
around the globe and have proven the stability and effectiveness of their product.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended action is based upon the estimated purchase of eight (8) maintenance terminals,
one (1) Smart Media Encoder, 80,000 cards, 1500 hours of web portal development, 170 platform
validators, installation of 24 platform validators, development hours to enhance the Handheld Smart
Media Readers (HSMRs), development hours to create the CAD/AVL and Smart Card interface, and
50 stanchion modifications. The funding is included in the Proposed 2014 - 2019 SBP Capital
Program and the proposed 2013 Amended Budget Request.
ALTERNATIVES
1)
Award the contract to Xerox, Inc., as recommended
2)
Do not purchase equipment. Validators would need to be reduced and redistributed
from the existing locations, impairing convenience for customer to tap before boarding
light rail. Not purchasing maintenance equipment will result in delayed response to
validator issues. Not purchasing an encoder could result in lengthy delays of delivering
cards ordered via the web due to equipment malfunction. Not purchasing smart cards
in the near term could result in not having cards available for employers and colleges to
distribute to their riders.
3)
A partial award to Xerox, Inc., for the validators, maintenance terminals and encoder,
as recommended. Issue an RFP for bid on additional smart cards. An RFP is currently
planned for distribution in June, 2013; however, the lengthy process for establishing
the proper encoding of security keys will result in a shortage of cards prior to the end
of 2013.
