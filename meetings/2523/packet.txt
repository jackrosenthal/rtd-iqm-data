Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Change

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions. Based upon current and past
ridership performance, Routes 89 and 116 Limited are proposed to be discontinued. Additionally, service
reductions on the W Line (light rail) are proposed in an effort to match the level of service to current
ridership demands. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes
and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change
recommendations.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service reductions:

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard: discontinue the 6:32pm northbound trip from Colorado Center
Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus: discontinue service due to very low ridership
Route 116L – Ken Caryl Limited: discontinues service on the Route 116L, due to very low ridership.
Route 169L – Buckley Road/Denver Airport: discontinue 7:10pm southbound trip daily and 5:10pm southbound
trip on Saturday and Sunday only.
Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride: discontinue the Call-n-Ride, due to low ridership
RockiesRide: discontinue all but two RockiesRide bus services
W Line (FasTracks): discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Route 44- 44th Avenue- reroute of service currently on Steele to use Clayton Street in order to avoid
sight distance/safety concerns at the University of Colorado A-Line crossing.
Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown: reroute of service currently on St. Vrain School District property
Route R/RC/RX – Brighton/ Denver; Brighton/Denver Express: renaming of route

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 15 – East Colfax: running time analysis
Rail Lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:
Minor running time adjustments are proposed for all light rail lines: C, D, E, F, H, and W Lines, on all
service days.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a cost reduction of $962,000 from
FasTracks and $614,400 cost saving from the base system, for a total savings of approximately
$1,576,000 annualized.
PUBLIC HEARINGS
There are eight public hearings proposed to be held between September 26th and October 5th in Aurora,
Brighton, Denver, Highlands Ranch, Ken Caryl, Lakewood, and Stapleton

1.C.1.a

Bus
Route 15 – East Colfax
This proposal supports routine schedule adjustments on the Route 15, which are
anticipated to have a resource impact, estimated to be $41,000 annualized.

Route 44 – 44th Avenue
It is proposed to reroute the current service to use Clayton Street to 40th Avenue in the
place of the current Steele Street routing to improve sight lines at the rail road crossing of
the University of Colorado A Line. No operation cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus
This proposal discontinues service on the Route 89, due to very low ridership. The route
currently averages 3 passengers per trip and 9 passengers per hour, which falls below the
17 passengers per hour required of Urban Local service. While the service was
implemented in response to a perceived gap in transportation in the Stapleton area, it has
not met the ridership standard for an Urban Local service. Alternatives to this service can
be found in the use of the University of Colorado A Line and the newly implemented R Line
light rail service. Anticipated cost savings are estimated to be $168,000 annualized.
Route 116L – Ken Caryl Limited
This proposal discontinues service on the Route 116L, due to very low ridership. The route
currently averages less than 5 passengers per trip and 6 passengers per hour, which falls
below the service standard for a 6.5 Suburban Local service. Alternatives to this service
can be found the use of Route 21 in the Bear Creek area and Green Mountain Call-n-Ride.
Anticipated cost savings are estimated to be $90,000 annualized.
Route 169L – Buckley Road/Denver Airport
This proposal discontinues the 7:10pm southbound trip weekday and weekends. This trip
averages 5 passengers per day. It is also proposed to discontinue the 5:10pm southbound
trip on Saturday and Sunday only, which averages 6 passengers per trip. Anticipated cost
savings are estimated to be $25,300 annualized.
Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown
Due to routing currently being on St. Vrain School District property and the request
of Silverthorne High School to remove the current terminal from school property, it
is proposed to reroute the Route 324 and locate a new west-end terminal at
Grandview Meadows Drive and Nelson Road, northbound, nearside Nelson Road.
No additional operational costs are anticipated.

Attachment: Winter 2016 (2898 : Winter 2016/2017 Service Change)

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard
It is proposed to discontinue the 6:32pm northbound trip from Colorado Center, which is
not needed to maintain 15 minute frequency on the Route 40. Cost savings are expected
to be an estimated $8,000 annualized.

1.C.1.a

Route R/RC/RX – Brighton/ Denver; Brighton/Denver Express
It is proposed to convert 3 PM peak north-bound and 2 AM peak southbound R
trips into RX trips and rename the route to RC/RX only. The renaming will provide
clarity in the route designation after the introduction of the new light rail R Line
service. No additional operational costs are anticipated.

Attachment: Winter 2016 (2898 : Winter 2016/2017 Service Change)

Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride
In November 2006, the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began service. The Call-n-Ride
operates Monday-Friday 6:00am – 6:00pm. Despite numerous marketing
campaigns and adjustments to the Call-n-Ride boundary, the Call-n-Ride falls in the
lowest category of boarding’s per hour and highest subsidy cost per boarding’s.
2015 end of the year numbers show the Call-n-Ride at 2.1 boarding’s per hour and
a subsidy cost of $36.30 per boarding. This recommendation is to discontinue the
Call-n-Ride service in Highlands Ranch. Alternative service includes Routes 402L
and 403. Anticipated cost savings are estimated to be $259,000 (based on 2015
numbers).
RockiesRide
With the major changes in transit corridors within the RTD, it is recommended that
many of the buses used for RockiesRide be redeployed to backup existing service
on Rockies game days in 2017. Rockies service for 2016 included opening day,
Saturday, Sunday and all fireworks games. The following changes are
recommended for the 2017 season:
 RockiesRide Route 36R / Wadsworth-Hampden – this route would be
discontinued and no replacement offered as ridership averages only 5
boardings per bus.
 RockiesRide Route 55R / Olde Town Arvada – customers will be able to use
new G Line that will be operating with service to Union Station.
 RockiesRide Route 86R / US36 & Broomfield – customers will be able to use
Flatiron Flyer service to Union Station. Back up buses will be available.
 RockiesRide Route 120R / Wagon Road-Thornton – Route to remain the
same – no changes.
 RockiesRide Route BR / Boulder High School, US36 & Table Mesa Station,
US 36 & McCaslin Station – customers will use new Flatiron Flyer with
service to Union Station. Backup buses will be available.
 RockiesRide Route LR / Longmont – Route to remain the same – no
changes.
Cost savings are anticipated to be an estimated $104,700 annualized.

Rail
W Line (FasTracks)
It is proposed to discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods:
Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:16 AM, 6:46 AM, 7:16 AM, 7:46 AM,
8:16 AM, 8:46 AM, 4:01 PM, 4:31 PM, 5:01 PM, 5:31 PM, and 6:01 PM and Westbound

1.C.1.a

trips from Union Station at 5:27 AM, 5:57 AM, 6:25 AM, 6:55 AM, 7:25 AM, 7:55 AM,
3:10 PM, 3:40 PM, 4:10 PM, 4:40 PM, 5:10 PM, and 5:40 PM. This proposed change
effects approximately 789 passengers that will need to take a W-Line 7.5 minutes earlier
or later. Three-car trains will be reapportioned to adjust crowding on trains to meet
Service Standards.

The peak vehicle requirement for the W Line service would be reduced from 23 cars to 16
cars, which helps improve the spare ratio, which will be below our standard when the I225 Rail Line opens.
The proposed change effects approximately 1,434 passengers that would need to take a
train 7.5 minutes earlier or later.
The anticipated cost savings are estimated to be approximately $962,000 annualized.
Rail Lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:
Minor running time adjustments are proposed for all light rail lines: C, D, E, F, H, and W
Lines, on all service days. This is based on new data received from adjusting the
scheduled timepoints, which allows for a more thorough running time analysis. Running
time will only change between 15 and 30 seconds and only between a few stations on
each line. This will not alter the light rail trips and the same service will be provided. No
changes in hours are anticipated.

Packet Pg. 7

Attachment: Winter 2016 (2898 : Winter 2016/2017 Service Change)

This proposal creates a 15-minute frequency in the AM and PM peak period, which is
similar to the majority of other individual light rail lines in the peak periods. It reduces the
peak hour, peak direction capacity from 1,500 passengers to 1,000 passengers. Existing
ridership in the peak hour, peak direction is approximately 740 passengers, which still
leaves room for future ridership growth. This brings the peak W Line operation closer to
the level of service of the rest of the system.

ADA Expert First Annual Report

As required by the Settlement Agreement between RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition
(CCDC), RTD retained the services of an “ADA Expert” to “review, audit, and prepare a written report
(“Initial Expert Report”) to ensure that RTD implements and enforces the policy required by the
Agreement.” This policy, Boarding Individuals with Disabilities Who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access
and referred to as the Policy, was designed to ensure that individuals with disabilities who use mobility
aids have equal access to fixed-route buses. The “Initial Expert Report” was shared with the Board of
Directors in November of 2014.
The Settlement Agreement further required that the ADA Expert return to RTD “to review, audit and
prepare a written follow-up report to ensure that RTD has taken the actions identified in the Initial Expert
Report (“Mid-Year Report”)”. The “Mid-Year Report” was shared with the Board of Directors in
September of 2015.
In June, 2016, KFH Group, Inc., of Bethesda, Maryland, (the “ADA Expert”) returned to Denver for the
purpose of preparing the first of three “Annual Reports” as required by the Settlement Agreement. The
“First Annual Report” was prepared based on data collected by KFH Group, and it included interviews
with RTD staff personnel and members of the disability community and observations made while riding
several RTD buses. A review was also conducted on the current pass-up incident data and ADA-related
customer complaints for fixed-route bus service.
The conclusions presented by KFH Group, Inc., stated that “RTD has continued its efforts to adhere to
the Settlement Agreement including the required reporting and to enforce the Policy over the past year.”
The ADA Expert also acknowledged that riders with disabilities continue to have “concerns about the
complaint process and placement of larger items in the aisle and securement areas.”
KFH Group, Inc., did not identify any formal deficiencies. However, the following recommendations
were made:


Complaint Handling: Procedures need to be better defined and consistently followed to ensure
that ADA-related complaints are correctly identified, investigated, addressed, and responded to in
a timely manner.
RTD staff is currently working on establishing detailed procedures to ensure that all ADA-related
complaints are properly captured, investigated, addressed and responded to in a consistent and
timely manner.



“Rules for Riders” – Etiquette Campaign: This campaign would provide all riders with RTD’s
expectations for acceptable behavior when riding the bus. This campaign would include “rules”
that “ensure riders using mobility devices have access to buses and the securement areas.”

Packet Pg. 8

1.C.2

RTD staff will work with the Marketing Department to incorporate this type of etiquette campaign
in 2017.


Interior Bus Design: Members of the disability community should be consulted for input regarding
the interior design of future bus procurements.
RTD staff did reach out to members of the disability community for input prior to purchasing the
new Access-a-Ride vehicles. Many of the recommendations received from these individuals were
incorporated into the new bus design. RTD will again solicit input from members of the disability
community prior to the next vehicle procurement.



Staff Training: In addition to ensuring that all ADA Refresher Training is provided in accordance
with the Settlement Agreement requirements, RTD should also proceed with the implementation
of ADA Awareness Training as recommended by a 2015 Leadership Academy project team.
RTD staff is exploring the possibility of getting the ADA Awareness Training included into a
future training curriculum. The required ADA Refresher Training commenced in September of
2016.



Undercover Ride Check Form: The responsibilities for the RTD undercover ride checkers should
be expanded to include observations and notations to ensure that operators attempt to make
room for passengers using a mobility device.
RTD is currently working to modify the Undercover Ride Check program to include this
requirement.

A copy of the First Annual Report from KFH Group, Inc., is attached to this report.

First Annual Report, 2016
In keeping with the Settlement Agreement (Agreement) between the Colorado Cross-Disability
Coalition (CCDC) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) of Denver dated February 19, 2014,
this report is the first of three Annual Reports to be provided following the required Initial Expert
Report, submitted in September 2014, and the Mid-Year Report, submitted in July 2015.
According to the Agreement, RTD was to retain a consultant that is experienced with Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance with fixed route bus service and otherwise unaffiliated with the RTD
to review and audit RTD’s implementation and enforcement of the Policy required through the
Agreement and to prepare specified reports. The Policy, titled Boarding Individuals with Disabilities
Who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access, is included in Appendix A to this report. The purpose of the
Policy as set out in the Agreement is: “RTD will ensure individuals who use Mobility Aids, including
Wheelchairs, have equal access to its buses and to the Securement Areas.”
On an annual basis after submittal of the first two required reports, the Agreement specifies that the
ADA Expert is to review, audit and prepare a report addressing RTD’s efforts to ensure that individuals
with disabilities who use mobility aids have equal access to fixed-route buses.
Efforts to prepare this First Annual Report have included:



Review and assessment of the Settlement Agreement required reporting,
On-site work including attendance at the June 2016 meeting of the Transit and Accessibility
Task Force of the Denver Regional Mobility and Access Council (DRMAC),
Meetings with senior RTD staff who manage fixed-route service and a meeting with a CCDC
representative,
Fixed-route bus trips for first hand observations (including on Routes 15, 15L and 40), and,
After the on-site work, follow-up discussions and correspondence with RTD staff and CCDC
representatives.

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REQUIRED REPORTING
The Agreement requires that RTD monitor bus operators’ compliance with the Policy in two ways:
(1) completion of the “CCDC Settlement Agreement Securement Area Issues Report” (Securement Area
Report), and (2) through a “Complaint Process” concerning the Policy. RTD also monitors its bus
service through deployment of Street Supervisors and its Undercover Ride Check Program.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

1.C.2.a

The Securement Area Reports are to document each time that a bus operator presses the ADA PAX
PASS-UP button and each time that a passenger complains that a bus operator has violated the Policy.

The first Securement Area Report included data from March 22, 2014 (when the Policy was adopted)
through April 30, 2014. This was referred to as the “Initial Report” in the Agreement and provides data
for just under six weeks. This first report and the efforts required for completion were reviewed in
detail in our Initial Expert Report.
In addition to this first Securement Area Report, the Agreement requires an annual Securement Area
Report beginning in 2015. RTD submitted the second Securement Area Report in January 2015, with
data from May 1, 2014 through the end of calendar year 2014. This second report, similar to the first,
includes all the data elements required by the Agreement, and covers a total of 35 weeks. Data in this
report was assessed in our Mid-Year Report.
The third Securement Area Report covers the full 2015 year and was submitted on January 15, 2016, as
required by the Agreement. Data on Pass-Ups from these Securement Area Reports are summarized in
Table 1 for the three time periods as well as the first five months of 2016.
The reasons for the Pass-Ups, including “two passengers in wheelchairs already occupying the two
securement areas” to “inoperable lifts” appear to be generally similar across the time periods. Based on
the data provided, the number of Pass-Ups on a weekly basis appears to range from about 11 to 17 per
week.

Complaint Process
In addition to the Pass-Up data, the Securement Area Reports document complaints regarding the
Policy. These complaints are handled as part of RTD’s customer service function, which handles all
complaints (as well as questions and comments) about RTD service, and complaints related to the
Policy were folded into this function.
Complaints, including those provided by email and telephone, are first handled by the Customer Care
Department. Complaints that are clearly ADA related or possibly ADA related are coded as “ADA.” This
includes complaints related to the Policy. The subset of complaints coded as ADA is then handled and
investigated by specific staff responsible for complaints for RTD-operated service and by staff
responsible for complaints related to contractor-operator service. The findings of the investigation for
every ADA related (and Policy related) complaint are detailed in monthly Customer Service Reports.
The complaints related to the Policy are also later added to the Securement Area Report, as required by
the Agreement.

The data also show a number of complaints that the operator has not given a rider using a wheelchair
the chance to board first before other riders, a procedure required by the Policy.

ADA REFRESHER TRAINING
The Agreement requires that bus operators and other operating staff as well as customer service
representatives participate in an annual “ADA Refresher Training” course. This training is to last for no
less than three hours total, with up to 45 minutes to cover the Policy. After the training, attendees are
to pass a test demonstrating an understanding of the material. The contractors are also required to
provide annual ADA Refresher Training, according to the Agreement, for their bus operators and other
operating staff.
RTD indicated that the ADA Refresher Training has not been initiated yet for 2016, as the training
materials are being revised and updated. More specifically, revisions are being incorporated to include
information on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Reasonable Modification Rule, which became
law in July 2015. This rule clarifies that public transportation agencies are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure programs
and services are accessible to people with disabilities.
RTD indicated that it will provide the ADA Refresher Training materials to CCDC for the organization’s
review prior to initiating the training this year as required by the Agreement. Such review in the past
has resulted in comments by CCDC, and RTD indicated that suggested revisions were made. We
believe that it is important that the training materials provided to CCDC for review are labeled as draft,
demonstrating that the material is not yet finalized and that revisions or changes are possible.
We suggest that the three RTD staff members who are responsible for investigating ADA and Policyrelated complaints provide specific input and potentially participate in the ADA Refresher Training
provided to the Customer Care Department staff who are tasked with taking complaints. These are the
staff members who initially document and categorize complaints which are then further reviewed,
investigated, and resolved, and it is critical that complaints are captured correctly and categorized
appropriately for further handling. Riders and particularly riders with disabilities given the Settlement
Agreement who take the time to complain about a specific issue deserve respect and attention to
address the identified issue. This is particularly important for those complainants who request a
response.

Table 2 displays the complaints related to the Policy since the start of data collection required by the
Agreement and through the end of 2015. While the Policy related complaints are a relatively small
number, the data show that issues remain with riders putting large items in the securement area as well
as riders boarding with strollers that are not folded. According to the information related to complaints
about strollers, the rider frequently tells the bus operator in these situations that the rider or the child
has a disability as the reason the stroller is not folded.

Other Potential Training on the ADA
In discussion with RTD staff about training on ADA issues, staff explained that a recent project
developed through the RTD Leadership Academy focused on ADA Awareness and envisioned an
organization-wide education campaign to ensure that all staff – at all agency departments – understand
ADA and what that means for public transportation. Significantly, this educational effort would include
training throughout the agency to help each staff member understand how their individual job impacts
riders with disabilities. This will be different for a mechanic who works on bus lifts, for someone who
plans bus routes, and for someone who sell fare media, but each staff member has a role in ensuring
that riders with disabilities can effectively and successful use RTD service.
This ADA Awareness effort is a more holistic approach to ADA training than that provided through the
Settlement Agreement required Refresher Training, which focuses only on staff in operations and the
Customer Care Department. Such an organization-wide effort would help staff understand the ADA and
their individual role in providing accessible public transit service to riders with disabilities.

INPUT FROM RIDERS WITH DISABILITIES
As part of our efforts for this Annual Report, we met with the Transit and Accessibility Task Force at the
June 2016 meeting. We also met with a representative of CCDC and had follow-up correspondence with
CCDC.
Discussion topics and issues raised are summarized below, some of which address issues beyond
Settlement Agreement related requirements.

Wheelchair Securement Tie-Downs
A member of the Task Force indicated that the tie-downs on the buses can be difficult to use. This
individual also said that he would prefer more versatile tie-downs particularly equipment that a rider
could use independently.

1.C.2.a

1.C.2.a

There was discussion about the difficulty of maneuvering a walker down the aisle of some of the newer
low floor buses. RTD had recognized this issue previously with the narrow aisle on these new buses,
including the 9300-series buses, given the partition/barrier installed in front of the first forward-facing
seats and initiated a retrofit on these buses to reduce the footprint of the partitions/barriers in order to
widen the aisle.
Given concerns raised at the Task Force meeting and input from other riders with disabilities, RTD’s
maintenance department determined that the retrofit on some of the 9300 series buses was not
adequate and a second retrofit is being scheduled on those buses.

Large Items and Grocery Caddies
The issue of large items and grocery caddies impeding access in the bus aisles and to the securement
area was raised, as it has been in the prior two years of our involvement with RTD and the
Settlement Agreement. Comments were made that the extra space area that has been created on the
buses by the removal of seats has helped the problem with these larger items that riders bring on the
bus, but issues remain.
In particularly, grocery caddies continue to be a problem based on the input from the riders with
disabilities. RTD has established a policy and procedures for its bus operators to deal with grocery
caddies. Accordingly, riders with grocery caddies are allowed to ride the bus without collapsing the
caddy and removing the groceries. These riders are to sit behind the securement area, positioning their
caddy so it does not block the aisles. Those riders who are elderly or have disabilities and traveling with
a grocery caddy, however, are allowed to sit in the priority/securement seating areas. However, if a
rider using a mobility device needs the securement area, the bus operator is to tell such riders with a
grocery caddy to move. RTD’s policy also states that the operators are to offer assistance to the riders in
this situation.

Customer Complaints
The issue of customer complaints was raised at the Transit and Accessibility Task Force meeting as well
as by the CCDC representative. We note that this issue was also raised last year during our efforts to
prepare the Mid-Year Report and documented in that report.
Discussion on complaints at the Task Force meeting began with comments that not all complaints
related to the Policy and service for riders with disabilities are provided to RTD. One Task Force
member said that he hears other riders describe a complaint but he said that apparently many of those
riders do not file a complaint to RTD. According to the discussion, this may be because riders are too
busy or just don’t get around to filing a complaint.
The CCDC representative noted that he has filed two complaints with RTD this calendar year (one
concerned fixed-route service for another rider who uses a wheelchair), each time asking for a response
but he has yet to receive a response. RTD investigated the fixed-route complaint, as it appears that it
was not appropriately captured when first provided in March, and provided a response in June.

1.C.2.a

For those complaints given by telephone, staff answering the phone do not automatically ask
complainants if they would like a response after the complaint is investigated. If a response is
specifically requested or if the complaint is particularly problematic, RTD will provide one. Regardless,
all complaints are investigated and, as appropriate, follow-up with the bus operator is conducted to
correct problems.
We suggest that RTD add the same question now provided for online complaints – “Would you like a
response from our customer service team once our investigation is complete?” – to its website under the
link “Contact Us” for those riders who wish to call regarding a complaint. In this way, those who call
with a complaint are treated equally with those who file a complaint online and given the same option
to request a response.
CCDC raised another issue regarding the complaint process. Apparently, CCDC members are
sometimes told to submit complaints to RTD’s ADA Manager rather than through RTD’s Customer Care
Department. This has led to some confusion about where or whom to submit complaints and likely
leads to frustration on the part of complainants. This may also lead to complaints “falling through the
cracks” and not resulting in a proper investigation.

Large and Oversize Mobility Devices
The Task Force discussed large and oversize mobility devices and problems that riders using such
devices face when using the bus. The increasing incidence of riders using larger and oversize
wheelchairs and other mobility devices is recognized within the transit industry, and it is a problem for
fixed route bus as well as paratransit operators. It is both changing demographics of the overall
population (with an increasing size and age of individuals) and the increasing size and weight of
wheeled and powered mobility devices that cause problems. It can be challenging to accommodate
larger and heavier passengers and mobility devices on transit vehicles that met the ADA standards in
place when the vehicles were purchased.
In 2011, the federal government issued revisions to parts of the ADA regulations. These include a revised
definition of the “common wheelchair.” And, to the point of larger mobility devices, the revisions
require that when transit agencies have vehicles and/or lifts that can handle larger and/or heavier
mobility devices, they are required to serve riders and their devices if the lift and vehicle can physically
accommodate them, unless doing so is inconsistent with legitimate safety requirements. This revision
recognizes the fact that many lifts are now designed to accommodate up to 800 pounds.
This discussion on larger and oversize mobility devices overlapped with the discussion on the design of
bus interiors, as documented below.

First Annual Report, 2016 l KFH Group

Packet Pg. 18

Attachment: First Annual Report and Appendix A 07.14.16 (2901 : ADA Expert First Annual Report)

The issue of response to complaints was further discussed. The online complaint form for those
complaints provided by email includes a question asking the complainant if a response is requested.
RTD reports that if a response is requested, a response is provided. This may take ten and up to 15 days
given the steps involved in the investigation and resolution.

1.C.2.a

The design of the interior of buses was discussed in relation to providing adequate space for riders
traveling with mobility devices and possible changes in configuring the wheelchair securement areas.
Within the overall space dimensions of a fixed-route bus and given the location of necessary vehicle
components (e.g., the wheel housings on low-floor buses) as well as ensuring compliance with ADA
regulations, the design of seating, wheelchair securement areas and priority seating for elderly
passengers and those with disabilities can have variations.
When RTD prepares specifications for new vehicles (or retrofits older ones), two suggestions from
CCDC are worth considering. One suggestion is to offset the wheelchair securement areas to allow
more room for riders with a mobility device, particularly a larger device, to maneuver into and out of
the space.
The second suggestion concerns the three aisle facing seats over the securement area on the new low
floor buses. When a rider with a walker sits in that area, the walker impedes access in the aisle. A
CCDC representative suggests that a previous design offers advantages, with two seats facing the aisle
and two facing the driver that give a rider with a walker the ability to sit facing the driver and a location
to put their walker by lifting up the seat facing the aisle.
We recommend that RTD involve the disability community directly when initiating plans for the next
bus procurement and at a time in the process where variations of the seating and securement area
design can be considered. This involvement will provide the opportunity to determine if there are
adjustments or variations or new ideas for the interior bus design that would improve access to fixed
route bus service for riders who use mobility devices. And this involvement can also address the issue
raised in our discussions with riders with disabilities related to larger and oversize mobility devices.
According to transit industry research, transit agencies can improve their accessibility with a “culture of
innovation and citizen advisory committees” that works collaboratively with the transit agency to make
“improvements for all passengers.” 1 This same research report documents efforts made by the transit
agency in Los Angeles to improve its bus accessibility with “new bold signage, forward facing seats as
priority seating, a dedicated spot for walkers that is not in the wheelchair space, and the use of the new
three-point securement systems that is intended to make securement easier for the driver or the
wheelchair users.” See Figure 1.

The transit agency serving the Philadelphia metro area (the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority or SEPTA) provides another example of operating buses with signage directly on the
passenger seats; see Figure 2. Starting around 2011, SEPTA has procured buses with such seating, which
is a more direct notice to riders about yielding seats to riders with disabilities including mobility
devices.

Another industry research report specifically recommends that it is “a good practice to seek input from
riders with disabilities when determining the type of vehicle, or specific type of equipment, to procure.”2
The report explains that some transit agencies have asked their vehicle vendors to provide “a ‘sample’

bus or rail car that riders can test by actually boarding, maneuvering to the securement area, and using
the securement system.” Input and comments from riders who use mobility devices can improve the
design of vehicles.

Other Issues
Other discussion at the Task Force meeting brought up service animals and the automatic stop
announcements (ASA) on the buses.
Regarding service animals, task members noted that some of the dogs that riders bring on board do not
appear to be service animals. According to the ADA, service animals do not have to wear a harness or
have a special ID tag that shows the animal is a service animal. However, the regulations state that a
bus operator, if there are questions as to whether the animal is a legitimate service animal, may ask the
rider if an animal is a service animal or ask what tasks the animal has been trained to perform.
RTD staff explained the transit agency’s policy on service animals, which states that bus operators are to
assume that a dog or other animal that a passenger brings on board is a service animal unless there is a
valid reason to believe otherwise. If there is a valid reason, the operator may ask if the animal is a
service animal for a person with a disability. If the passenger says yes, then operators are instructed to
do nothing further unless the animal creates problems or is disruptive on the bus. At that point, the
operator is instructed to contact dispatch for direction.
One Task Force member commented that the ASAs are very useful but said that if the ASAs are not
working, the bus operator does not always call out stops and this is a problem. RTD’s bus operators are
trained to call out stops in such situations. RTD staff said that when operators fail to call out stops
should the ASA not be functioning, riders should contact RTD so that the agency can follow up with the
operator in question.
There were also a couple of more general comments at the Task Force meeting regarding the experience
with fixed route bus service by riders with disabilities. One member stated that generally bus operators
have a better attitude than in the past with their interactions with riders with disabilities and that there
is general improvement in serving riders with disabilities. Another Task Member commented that the
operators mostly understand how to deal with his particular mobility device and try to ensure the aisle
is clear so that he can maneuver to his seat.

SUMMARY AND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS
RTD has continued its efforts to adhere to the Settlement Agreement including the required reporting
and to enforce the Policy over the past year. These efforts require dedicated staff resources and
attention; key staff involved in ensuring compliance with the Policy appear committed to the mission.

11
First Annual Report, 2016 l KFH Group

Packet Pg. 21

Attachment: First Annual Report and Appendix A 07.14.16 (2901 : ADA Expert First Annual Report)

RTD recently involved its ADA paratransit advisory committee when evaluating vehicles being
considered for procurement for Access-A-Ride. This was reportedly a useful and cooperative
undertaking and allowed RTD to incorporate most of the suggestions offered by committee members.

1.C.2.a

We have not identified formal deficiencies. But, based on our review of the Policy-required data reports
as well as discussions and input from riders with disabilities and RTD staff, we identify the following
actions that RTD should pursue to ensure not just compliance with the Policy but a commitment to
providing service to its riders who have disabilities.


Complaint Handling: RTD needs to ensure that complaints related to the Policy are captured
when submitted by a rider, that they are investigated and resolved, and as appropriate, that a
response is provided to the complainant. This may require more targeted and specific training to
the Customer Care Department staff who are the frontline when complaints are submitted.
These staff should err on the side of coding a complaint as ADA if there is any question that it
might be and allow the three RTD staff members tasked with reviewing ADA complaints to
determine if a complaint is related to the Policy. We further suggest that these three staff
members provide input to and possibly participate in the ADA refresher training for Customer
Service staff. RTD should also review current procedures for complaint categorization to ensure
all complaints related to the Policy are appropriately captured, categorized, investigated, and, as
needed, responded to. We further suggest that RTD let complainants who submit a complaint
by telephone know that they can request a response.
RTD should also clarify procedures for complaints so that those complaining about ADA issues
know where to send their complaints. Once resolved, procedures should be clearly stated on the
RTD website and disseminated as appropriate.



“Rules for Riders” – Etiquette Campaign: We strongly recommend that RTD develop,
publish, and disseminate what we refer to as “rules for riders,” which are a set of statements that
tell riders what RTD expects of them when riding the bus. These should explicitly include
statements explaining “rules” that ensure riders using mobility devices have access to buses and
to the securement areas. For example, one of the rules should state: “At bus stops, allow riders
using mobility devices including wheelchairs to board first.” This is our third report to include
this recommended action regarding development of “rules for riders.”
The “rules of the road” can be the centerpiece of an etiquette campaign, an effort that reportedly
RTD is considering. We recommend that RTD pursue such a campaign as soon as possible and
dedicate adequate resources for an effective and sustained campaign. Some transit agencies
have worked with graphics design students at a local college or university to provide support
with graphics, an approach that can be cost-effective.
We also suggest that the campaign indicate why it is important to allow riders using wheelchairs
to board first and to ensure they have access to the wheelchair securement area. It isn’t just
good manners or “just” the law to allow such riders to have access to the securement positions.
Without this access, riders who use wheelchairs are unable to ride public transit. One approach
to getting this point across is to include a video of actual riders who use wheelchairs stating why
they need this access, and use these personal testimonies as part of the campaign. Personal
stories from real people can be very powerful, and may be more effective than communicating
rules alone.

Input from riders with disabilities regarding compliance suggests mixed results. There continue to be
concerns about the complaint process and placement of larger items in the aisle and securement areas,
which impedes access for riders using mobility devices.

1.C.2.a



Interior Bus Design: We strongly encourage RTD to involve representative riders with
disabilities when the transit agency begins to plan for the next bus procurement. Such input
may be very useful in considering and possibly adopting variations or new options for the bus
seating and securement areas that will improve access and service for riders who use mobility
devices.
Additionally, given that the large majority of Pass-Ups have been due to both of the securement
areas already being occupied by passengers in wheelchairs (consistently 65-69% of all Pass-Ups
reported during March 2014 to December 2015), RTD could consider procuring buses with three
securement positions rather than two. The transit agency in Corpus Christi, Texas was able to
do this in a 40’ transit coach without reducing its standard bus seating.



Staff Training: RTD should ensure it completes the required ADA Refresher Training for the
Settlement Agreement-identified staff, once the training materials have been reviewed by
CCDC. RTD should also commit resources to implementing the ADA Awareness campaign
developed through the Leadership Academy, an internally-initiated education effort that will
help staff members throughout the agency understand their role in providing accessible service
that meets both the ADA regulations as well as the intent of the ADA.



Undercover Ride Check Form: RTD has an Undercover Ride Check program that uses parttime employees to provide unobserved checks of bus operators compliance with specific duties
and responsibilities related to ADA service, including, among others, did the operator attempt to
make room for passenger with a mobility device? To address a concern raised by CCDC that bus
operators do not always call in all Pass-Ups as required by the Agreement, we suggest that this
item be added to the Undercover Ride Check Form as another compliance item to monitor. This
would involve revision to the current form and instructions to the checkers that they have one
additional matter to look for. The instructions to the checkers should also include an
explanation of the proper procedures regarding a Pass-Up so the checkers understand what bus
operators should do and determine if the operator followed the right procedures.

First Annual Report, 2016
In keeping with the Settlement Agreement (Agreement) between the Colorado Cross-Disability
Coalition (CCDC) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) of Denver dated February 19, 2014,
this report is the first of three Annual Reports to be provided following the required Initial Expert
Report, submitted in September 2014, and the Mid-Year Report, submitted in July 2015.
According to the Agreement, RTD was to retain a consultant that is experienced with Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance with fixed route bus service and otherwise unaffiliated with the RTD
to review and audit RTD’s implementation and enforcement of the Policy required through the
Agreement and to prepare specified reports. The Policy, titled Boarding Individuals with Disabilities
Who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access, is included in Appendix A to this report. The purpose of the
Policy as set out in the Agreement is: “RTD will ensure individuals who use Mobility Aids, including
Wheelchairs, have equal access to its buses and to the Securement Areas.”
On an annual basis after submittal of the first two required reports, the Agreement specifies that the
ADA Expert is to review, audit and prepare a report addressing RTD’s efforts to ensure that individuals
with disabilities who use mobility aids have equal access to fixed-route buses.
Efforts to prepare this First Annual Report have included:


representative,
Fixed-route bus trips for first hand observations (including on Routes 15, 15L and 40), and,

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REQUIRED REPORTING
The Agreement requires that RTD monitor bus operators’ compliance with the Policy in two ways:
(1) completion of the “CCDC Settlement Agreement Securement Area Issues Report” (Securement Area
Report), and (2) through a “Complaint Process” concerning the Policy. RTD also monitors its bus
service through deployment of Street Supervisors and its Undercover Ride Check Program.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

1.C.2.b

The Securement Area Reports are to document each time that a bus operator presses the ADA PAX
PASS-UP button and each time that a passenger complains that a bus operator has violated the Policy.

The first Securement Area Report included data from March 22, 2014 (when the Policy was adopted)
through April 30, 2014. This was referred to as the “Initial Report” in the Agreement and provides data
for just under six weeks. This first report and the efforts required for completion were reviewed in
detail in our Initial Expert Report.
In addition to this first Securement Area Report, the Agreement requires an annual Securement Area
Report beginning in 2015. RTD submitted the second Securement Area Report in January 2015, with
data from May 1, 2014 through the end of calendar year 2014. This second report, similar to the first,
includes all the data elements required by the Agreement, and covers a total of 35 weeks. Data in this
report was assessed in our Mid-Year Report.
The third Securement Area Report covers the full 2015 year and was submitted on January 15, 2016, as
required by the Agreement. Data on Pass-Ups from these Securement Area Reports are summarized in
Table 1 for the three time periods as well as the first five months of 2016.
The reasons for the Pass-Ups, including “two passengers in wheelchairs already occupying the two
securement areas” to “inoperable lifts” appear to be generally similar across the time periods. Based on
the data provided, the number of Pass-Ups on a weekly basis appears to range from about 11 to 17 per
week.

Complaint Process
In addition to the Pass-Up data, the Securement Area Reports document complaints regarding the
Policy. These complaints are handled as part of RTD’s customer service function, which handles all
complaints (as well as questions and comments) about RTD service, and complaints related to the
Policy were folded into this function.
Complaints, including those provided by email and telephone, are first handled by the Customer Care
Department. Complaints that are clearly ADA related or possibly ADA related are coded as “ADA.” This
includes complaints related to the Policy. The subset of complaints coded as ADA is then handled and
investigated by specific staff responsible for complaints for RTD-operated service and by staff
responsible for complaints related to contractor-operator service. The findings of the investigation for
every ADA related (and Policy related) complaint are detailed in monthly Customer Service Reports.
The complaints related to the Policy are also later added to the Securement Area Report, as required by
the Agreement.

The data also show a number of complaints that the operator has not given a rider using a wheelchair
the chance to board first before other riders, a procedure required by the Policy.

ADA REFRESHER TRAINING
The Agreement requires that bus operators and other operating staff as well as customer service
representatives participate in an annual “ADA Refresher Training” course. This training is to last for no
less than three hours total, with up to 45 minutes to cover the Policy. After the training, attendees are
to pass a test demonstrating an understanding of the material. The contractors are also required to
provide annual ADA Refresher Training, according to the Agreement, for their bus operators and other
operating staff.
RTD indicated that the ADA Refresher Training has not been initiated yet for 2016, as the training
materials are being revised and updated. More specifically, revisions are being incorporated to include
information on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Reasonable Modification Rule, which became
law in July 2015. This rule clarifies that public transportation agencies are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure programs
and services are accessible to people with disabilities.
RTD indicated that it will provide the ADA Refresher Training materials to CCDC for the organization’s
review prior to initiating the training this year as required by the Agreement. Such review in the past
has resulted in comments by CCDC, and RTD indicated that suggested revisions were made. We
believe that it is important that the training materials provided to CCDC for review are labeled as draft,
demonstrating that the material is not yet finalized and that revisions or changes are possible.
We suggest that the three RTD staff members who are responsible for investigating ADA and Policyrelated complaints provide specific input and potentially participate in the ADA Refresher Training
provided to the Customer Care Department staff who are tasked with taking complaints. These are the
staff members who initially document and categorize complaints which are then further reviewed,
investigated, and resolved, and it is critical that complaints are captured correctly and categorized
appropriately for further handling. Riders and particularly riders with disabilities given the Settlement
Agreement who take the time to complain about a specific issue deserve respect and attention to
address the identified issue. This is particularly important for those complainants who request a
response.

Table 2 displays the complaints related to the Policy since the start of data collection required by the
Agreement and through the end of 2015. While the Policy related complaints are a relatively small
number, the data show that issues remain with riders putting large items in the securement area as well
as riders boarding with strollers that are not folded. According to the information related to complaints
about strollers, the rider frequently tells the bus operator in these situations that the rider or the child
has a disability as the reason the stroller is not folded.

Other Potential Training on the ADA
In discussion with RTD staff about training on ADA issues, staff explained that a recent project
developed through the RTD Leadership Academy focused on ADA Awareness and envisioned an
organization-wide education campaign to ensure that all staff – at all agency departments – understand
ADA and what that means for public transportation. Significantly, this educational effort would include
training throughout the agency to help each staff member understand how their individual job impacts
riders with disabilities. This will be different for a mechanic who works on bus lifts, for someone who
plans bus routes, and for someone who sell fare media, but each staff member has a role in ensuring
that riders with disabilities can effectively and successful use RTD service.
This ADA Awareness effort is a more holistic approach to ADA training than that provided through the
Settlement Agreement required Refresher Training, which focuses only on staff in operations and the
Customer Care Department. Such an organization-wide effort would help staff understand the ADA and
their individual role in providing accessible public transit service to riders with disabilities.

INPUT FROM RIDERS WITH DISABILITIES
As part of our efforts for this Annual Report, we met with the Transit and Accessibility Task Force at the
June 2016 meeting. We also met with a representative of CCDC and had follow-up correspondence with
CCDC.
Discussion topics and issues raised are summarized below, some of which address issues beyond
Settlement Agreement related requirements.

Wheelchair Securement Tie-Downs
A member of the Task Force indicated that the tie-downs on the buses can be difficult to use. This
individual also said that he would prefer more versatile tie-downs particularly equipment that a rider
could use independently.

Partition/Barriers in Front of First Forward-Facing Seats on Newer Buses

Given concerns raised at the Task Force meeting and input from other riders with disabilities, RTD’s
maintenance department determined that the retrofit on some of the 9300 series buses was not
adequate and a second retrofit is being scheduled on those buses.

Large Items and Grocery Caddies
The issue of large items and grocery caddies impeding access in the bus aisles and to the securement
area was raised, as it has been in the prior two years of our involvement with RTD and the
Settlement Agreement. Comments were made that the extra space area that has been created on the
buses by the removal of seats has helped the problem with these larger items that riders bring on the
bus, but issues remain.
In particularly, grocery caddies continue to be a problem based on the input from the riders with
disabilities. RTD has established a policy and procedures for its bus operators to deal with grocery
caddies. Accordingly, riders with grocery caddies are allowed to ride the bus without collapsing the
caddy and removing the groceries. These riders are to sit behind the securement area, positioning their
caddy so it does not block the aisles. Those riders who are elderly or have disabilities and traveling with
a grocery caddy, however, are allowed to sit in the priority/securement seating areas. However, if a
rider using a mobility device needs the securement area, the bus operator is to tell such riders with a
grocery caddy to move. RTD’s policy also states that the operators are to offer assistance to the riders in
this situation.

Customer Complaints
The issue of customer complaints was raised at the Transit and Accessibility Task Force meeting as well
as by the CCDC representative. We note that this issue was also raised last year during our efforts to
prepare the Mid-Year Report and documented in that report.
Discussion on complaints at the Task Force meeting began with comments that not all complaints
related to the Policy and service for riders with disabilities are provided to RTD. One Task Force
member said that he hears other riders describe a complaint but he said that apparently many of those
riders do not file a complaint to RTD. According to the discussion, this may be because riders are too
busy or just don’t get around to filing a complaint.
The CCDC representative noted that he has filed two complaints with RTD this calendar year (one
concerned fixed-route service for another rider who uses a wheelchair), each time asking for a response
but he has yet to receive a response. RTD investigated the fixed-route complaint, as it appears that it
was not appropriately captured when first provided in March, and provided a response in June.

Packet Pg. 35

Attachment: First Annual Report - screen reader (2901 : ADA Expert First Annual Report)

There was discussion about the difficulty of maneuvering a walker down the aisle of some of the newer
low floor buses. RTD had recognized this issue previously with the narrow aisle on these new buses,
including the 9300-series buses, given the partition/barrier installed in front of the first forward-facing
seats and initiated a retrofit on these buses to reduce the footprint of the partitions/barriers in order to
widen the aisle.

1.C.2.b

For those complaints given by telephone, staff answering the phone do not automatically ask
complainants if they would like a response after the complaint is investigated. If a response is
specifically requested or if the complaint is particularly problematic, RTD will provide one. Regardless,
all complaints are investigated and, as appropriate, follow-up with the bus operator is conducted to
correct problems.
We suggest that RTD add the same question now provided for online complaints – “Would you like a
response from our customer service team once our investigation is complete?” – to its website under the
link “Contact Us” for those riders who wish to call regarding a complaint. In this way, those who call
with a complaint are treated equally with those who file a complaint online and given the same option
to request a response.
CCDC raised another issue regarding the complaint process. Apparently, CCDC members are
sometimes told to submit complaints to RTD’s ADA Manager rather than through RTD’s Customer Care
Department. This has led to some confusion about where or whom to submit complaints and likely
leads to frustration on the part of complainants. This may also lead to complaints “falling through the
cracks” and not resulting in a proper investigation.

Large and Oversize Mobility Devices
The Task Force discussed large and oversize mobility devices and problems that riders using such
devices face when using the bus. The increasing incidence of riders using larger and oversize
wheelchairs and other mobility devices is recognized within the transit industry, and it is a problem for
fixed route bus as well as paratransit operators. It is both changing demographics of the overall
population (with an increasing size and age of individuals) and the increasing size and weight of
wheeled and powered mobility devices that cause problems. It can be challenging to accommodate
larger and heavier passengers and mobility devices on transit vehicles that met the ADA standards in
place when the vehicles were purchased.
In 2011, the federal government issued revisions to parts of the ADA regulations. These include a revised
definition of the “common wheelchair.” And, to the point of larger mobility devices, the revisions
require that when transit agencies have vehicles and/or lifts that can handle larger and/or heavier
mobility devices, they are required to serve riders and their devices if the lift and vehicle can physically
accommodate them, unless doing so is inconsistent with legitimate safety requirements. This revision
recognizes the fact that many lifts are now designed to accommodate up to 800 pounds.
This discussion on larger and oversize mobility devices overlapped with the discussion on the design of
bus interiors, as documented below.

The issue of response to complaints was further discussed. The online complaint form for those
complaints provided by email includes a question asking the complainant if a response is requested.
RTD reports that if a response is requested, a response is provided. This may take ten and up to 15 days
given the steps involved in the investigation and resolution.

1.C.2.b

Interior Bus Design

When RTD prepares specifications for new vehicles (or retrofits older ones), two suggestions from
CCDC are worth considering. One suggestion is to offset the wheelchair securement areas to allow
more room for riders with a mobility device, particularly a larger device, to maneuver into and out of
the space.
The second suggestion concerns the three aisle facing seats over the securement area on the new low
floor buses. When a rider with a walker sits in that area, the walker impedes access in the aisle. A
CCDC representative suggests that a previous design offers advantages, with two seats facing the aisle
and two facing the driver that give a rider with a walker the ability to sit facing the driver and a location
to put their walker by lifting up the seat facing the aisle.
We recommend that RTD involve the disability community directly when initiating plans for the next
bus procurement and at a time in the process where variations of the seating and securement area
design can be considered. This involvement will provide the opportunity to determine if there are
adjustments or variations or new ideas for the interior bus design that would improve access to fixed
route bus service for riders who use mobility devices. And this involvement can also address the issue
raised in our discussions with riders with disabilities related to larger and oversize mobility devices.
According to transit industry research, transit agencies can improve their accessibility with a “culture of
innovation and citizen advisory committees” that works collaboratively with the transit agency to make
“improvements for all passengers.” 1 This same research report documents efforts made by the transit
agency in Los Angeles to improve its bus accessibility with “new bold signage, forward facing seats as
priority seating, a dedicated spot for walkers that is not in the wheelchair space, and the use of the new
three-point securement systems that is intended to make securement easier for the driver or the
wheelchair users.” See Figure 1.

The design of the interior of buses was discussed in relation to providing adequate space for riders
traveling with mobility devices and possible changes in configuring the wheelchair securement areas.
Within the overall space dimensions of a fixed-route bus and given the location of necessary vehicle
components (e.g., the wheel housings on low-floor buses) as well as ensuring compliance with ADA
regulations, the design of seating, wheelchair securement areas and priority seating for elderly
passengers and those with disabilities can have variations.

Figure 1: Priority seating near the front of the bus on MTA buses in Los Angeles

The transit agency serving the Philadelphia metro area (the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority or SEPTA) provides another example of operating buses with signage directly on the
passenger seats; see Figure 2. Starting around 2011, SEPTA has procured buses with such seating, which
is a more direct notice to riders about yielding seats to riders with disabilities including mobility
devices.

Figure 2: Priority seating on SEPTA buses

Another industry research report specifically recommends that it is “a good practice to seek input from
riders with disabilities when determining the type of vehicle, or specific type of equipment, to procure.”2
The report explains that some transit agencies have asked their vehicle vendors to provide “a ‘sample’

bus or rail car that riders can test by actually boarding, maneuvering to the securement area, and using
the securement system.” Input and comments from riders who use mobility devices can improve the
design of vehicles.

Other Issues
Other discussion at the Task Force meeting brought up service animals and the automatic stop
announcements (ASA) on the buses.
Regarding service animals, task members noted that some of the dogs that riders bring on board do not
appear to be service animals. According to the ADA, service animals do not have to wear a harness or
have a special ID tag that shows the animal is a service animal. However, the regulations state that a
bus operator, if there are questions as to whether the animal is a legitimate service animal, may ask the
rider if an animal is a service animal or ask what tasks the animal has been trained to perform.
RTD staff explained the transit agency’s policy on service animals, which states that bus operators are to
assume that a dog or other animal that a passenger brings on board is a service animal unless there is a
valid reason to believe otherwise. If there is a valid reason, the operator may ask if the animal is a
service animal for a person with a disability. If the passenger says yes, then operators are instructed to
do nothing further unless the animal creates problems or is disruptive on the bus. At that point, the
operator is instructed to contact dispatch for direction.
One Task Force member commented that the ASAs are very useful but said that if the ASAs are not
working, the bus operator does not always call out stops and this is a problem. RTD’s bus operators are
trained to call out stops in such situations. RTD staff said that when operators fail to call out stops
should the ASA not be functioning, riders should contact RTD so that the agency can follow up with the
operator in question.
There were also a couple of more general comments at the Task Force meeting regarding the experience
with fixed route bus service by riders with disabilities. One member stated that generally bus operators
have a better attitude than in the past with their interactions with riders with disabilities and that there
is general improvement in serving riders with disabilities. Another Task Member commented that the
operators mostly understand how to deal with his particular mobility device and try to ensure the aisle
is clear so that he can maneuver to his seat.

SUMMARY AND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS
RTD has continued its efforts to adhere to the Settlement Agreement including the required reporting
and to enforce the Policy over the past year. These efforts require dedicated staff resources and
attention; key staff involved in ensuring compliance with the Policy appear committed to the mission.

11
First Annual Report, 2016 l KFH Group

Packet Pg. 39

Attachment: First Annual Report - screen reader (2901 : ADA Expert First Annual Report)

RTD recently involved its ADA paratransit advisory committee when evaluating vehicles being
considered for procurement for Access-A-Ride. This was reportedly a useful and cooperative
undertaking and allowed RTD to incorporate most of the suggestions offered by committee members.

1.C.2.b

Input from riders with disabilities regarding compliance suggests mixed results. There continue to be
concerns about the complaint process and placement of larger items in the aisle and securement areas,
which impedes access for riders using mobility devices.



Complaint Handling: RTD needs to ensure that complaints related to the Policy are captured
when submitted by a rider, that they are investigated and resolved, and as appropriate, that a
response is provided to the complainant. This may require more targeted and specific training to
the Customer Care Department staff who are the frontline when complaints are submitted.
These staff should err on the side of coding a complaint as ADA if there is any question that it
might be and allow the three RTD staff members tasked with reviewing ADA complaints to
determine if a complaint is related to the Policy. We further suggest that these three staff
members provide input to and possibly participate in the ADA refresher training for Customer
Service staff. RTD should also review current procedures for complaint categorization to ensure
all complaints related to the Policy are appropriately captured, categorized, investigated, and, as
needed, responded to. We further suggest that RTD let complainants who submit a complaint
by telephone know that they can request a response.
RTD should also clarify procedures for complaints so that those complaining about ADA issues
know where to send their complaints. Once resolved, procedures should be clearly stated on the
RTD website and disseminated as appropriate.



“Rules for Riders” – Etiquette Campaign: We strongly recommend that RTD develop,
publish, and disseminate what we refer to as “rules for riders,” which are a set of statements that
tell riders what RTD expects of them when riding the bus. These should explicitly include
statements explaining “rules” that ensure riders using mobility devices have access to buses and
to the securement areas. For example, one of the rules should state: “At bus stops, allow riders
using mobility devices including wheelchairs to board first.” This is our third report to include
this recommended action regarding development of “rules for riders.”
The “rules of the road” can be the centerpiece of an etiquette campaign, an effort that reportedly
RTD is considering. We recommend that RTD pursue such a campaign as soon as possible and
dedicate adequate resources for an effective and sustained campaign. Some transit agencies
have worked with graphics design students at a local college or university to provide support
with graphics, an approach that can be cost-effective.
We also suggest that the campaign indicate why it is important to allow riders using wheelchairs
to board first and to ensure they have access to the wheelchair securement area. It isn’t just
good manners or “just” the law to allow such riders to have access to the securement positions.
Without this access, riders who use wheelchairs are unable to ride public transit. One approach
to getting this point across is to include a video of actual riders who use wheelchairs stating why
they need this access, and use these personal testimonies as part of the campaign. Personal
stories from real people can be very powerful, and may be more effective than communicating
rules alone.

We have not identified formal deficiencies. But, based on our review of the Policy-required data reports
as well as discussions and input from riders with disabilities and RTD staff, we identify the following
actions that RTD should pursue to ensure not just compliance with the Policy but a commitment to
providing service to its riders who have disabilities.

1.C.2.b



Interior Bus Design: We strongly encourage RTD to involve representative riders with
disabilities when the transit agency begins to plan for the next bus procurement. Such input
may be very useful in considering and possibly adopting variations or new options for the bus
seating and securement areas that will improve access and service for riders who use mobility
devices.
Additionally, given that the large majority of Pass-Ups have been due to both of the securement
areas already being occupied by passengers in wheelchairs (consistently 65-69% of all Pass-Ups
reported during March 2014 to December 2015), RTD could consider procuring buses with three
securement positions rather than two. The transit agency in Corpus Christi, Texas was able to
do this in a 40’ transit coach without reducing its standard bus seating.



Staff Training: RTD should ensure it completes the required ADA Refresher Training for the
Settlement Agreement-identified staff, once the training materials have been reviewed by
CCDC. RTD should also commit resources to implementing the ADA Awareness campaign
developed through the Leadership Academy, an internally-initiated education effort that will
help staff members throughout the agency understand their role in providing accessible service
that meets both the ADA regulations as well as the intent of the ADA.



Undercover Ride Check Form: RTD has an Undercover Ride Check program that uses parttime employees to provide unobserved checks of bus operators compliance with specific duties
and responsibilities related to ADA service, including, among others, did the operator attempt to
make room for passenger with a mobility device? To address a concern raised by CCDC that bus
operators do not always call in all Pass-Ups as required by the Agreement, we suggest that this
item be added to the Undercover Ride Check Form as another compliance item to monitor. This
would involve revision to the current form and instructions to the checkers that they have one
additional matter to look for. The instructions to the checkers should also include an
explanation of the proper procedures regarding a Pass-Up so the checkers understand what bus
operators should do and determine if the operator followed the right procedures.

2016 2nd Quarter Contracted Fixed Route
Report

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the second quarter of 2016 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 2nd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize
bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators.
The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings,
through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in
the 2nd quarter. First Transit Longmont and First Transit Commerce City did not meet the goal;
however, only one of the passenger accidents that occurred in the 2nd quarter (3 year to date)
was classified as preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of
passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger
accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 2nd quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.

Packet Pg. 43

1.C.3



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
First Transit Denver, and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time Service
with 88.1% and 89.2% on-time performance respectively in the 2nd quarter. Transdev continues
to make progress with 87.9% and First Transit Commerce City declined to 84.1% on-time
performance due in part to the high number of new operators. RTD and the private contractors
continue to campaign routes and operators with low on time performance with a strong focus on
first time point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with
operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach
88% on time performance. Running time issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and
Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 28,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 2nd quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 complaints
per boarding in the 2nd quarter. First Transit Commerce City and First Transit Denver held steady
at .0005 and Transdev improved to .0007 Complaints per Boarding in the 2nd quarter.
Complaints per board continue to reflect the difficulties experienced in the earlier part of the year
due to operator shortages which resulted in a high number of bus late and bus no show
complaints. The contractors continue to investigate and address customer complaints with
operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist
operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding ontime performance should help address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue
to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

2016 2nd Quarter Access-a-Ride/Cab Report

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 1% through the 2nd quarter of 2016 compared to the same period
of 2015. Productivity increased from 1.19 to 1.24 passengers per hour. During the same period,
Access-a-Cab ridership decreased by 10%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership
decreased by 2% compared to 2015. Total boardings decreased from 457,576 total boardings thru Q2
of 2015 to 449,918 total boardings thru Q2 of 2016.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride decreased by 4% through the 2nd quarter of 2016
as compared to the same period of 2015. Access-a-Ride is approximately 5% under budgeted revenue
hours through the second quarter of 2016.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 2nd quarter of 2016 was 95.3% a slight decrease as compared
to the same period of 2015 (95.6%).
Passenger on-time performance through the 2nd quarter of 2016 was 83.87% a slight decrease as
compared to the same period in 2015 (84.27%).
On time performance continues to be challenging as a result of operator shortages and the continuing
trend of traffic, construction, and other delays. Our private contractors continue to address the operator
shortage challenge by utilizing radio, on-line websites, job fairs, and help-wanted ads as a means of
attracting potential operators. In addition, our dedicated vehicle service providers have instituted salary
increases, hiring bonuses, and other incentives in order to attract and retain operators.
Customer Complaints
Complaints increased through the 2nd quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Staff
continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer satisfaction.

Preventable Accidents:

2nd Qtr 2015 – 3 Accidents

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Ridership continues to be down. Changes to how we are scheduling trips for the school children,
low gas prices and the new fare increases have affected ridership in the Call-n-Ride areas.
All Call-n-Rides have had new computers installed.
internet connections.

This makes for better scheduling and better

Belmar – The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
Light Rail service. The Call-n-Ride operated with 2 peak vehicles and one all day vehicle, weekdays
only. Over the past two years, the service has been modified to improve ridership as it does not
meet the minimum of three boardings per hour. The RTD Board approved discontinuance of this Call-

1.C.5

n-Ride in April 2016. The Call-n-Ride was discontinued as planned. April 22nd was the last operating
day.
Evergreen – A strong Call-n-Ride over the years, there are two major factors in the decline of
ridership: a school whose students rode CnR closed and the Extension program for the disabled
moved and acquired their own bus. We have met with the Seniors’ Resources Center (SRC) and
they have been actively working with the senior living communities and the schools to increase
ridership. A Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) was formed to evaluate the service and make
recommendations for change. As a direct result of the TAC, marketing has taken place, a shopping
trip was created for the seniors, and Call-n-Ride worked to encourage school age children to use CnR
for school trips. At the end of 2015, the shopping trip was discontinued but marketing continues.
Ridership has increased to over 3 boardings per hour Jan-May 2016. With school ending in May,
ridership has declined for the summer months.
Highlands Ranch - This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Highlands
Ranch CnR replaced the poorly performing Route 426 Ranch Rider. Over the years RTD has tried
numerous adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be
discontinued twice. Highlands Ranch has carried a high percentage of Access-a-Ride qualified users.
While the subsidy is high for the CnR, if CnR were to be discontinued, this ridership would move to
Access-a-Ride where the subsidy would be much higher. Douglas County has contributed financially
to the CnR in the past. In 2015 Douglas County and Highlands Ranch provided a cost share with the
RTD for 50% of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to re-evaluate service and develop marketing to
increase ridership. The TAC came up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015
runboard. The school trippers have increased ridership slightly, but this requires a great deal of staff
time. Ridership continues to be a challenge. Recommendation to discontinue the Call-n-Ride has
been placed in the Winter 2016 Service Recommendation.
Parker – This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Over the years RTD has
made adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued
twice. In 2015 Douglas County and the Town of Parker provided a cost share with the RTD for 50%
of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to re-evaluate service and develop marketing to increase
ridership. The TAC came up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015 runboard.
In August 2016, a school trip was set up that is showing positive results. The impacts of this
change on ridership will be reported in the next quarterly report.

As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The 2015 goal remained at .0004
complaints per passenger boarding. The 2016 goal was again set at .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
For the 2nd Quarter of 2016, RTD and First Transit Longmont met the goal of .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding. First Transit Commerce City and First Transit Denver had .0005 complaints per
passenger boarding. Transdev (formerly Veolia) had .0007 complaints per passenger boarding. The
combined performance for all of the private contractors was .0005 complaints per passenger boarding.
The combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

1.C.7

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
 RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2016, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 2nd Quarter 2016: the complaints in this category increased 58.4% compared to
the same period in 2015. Due to on-going operator shortages at both RTD and the private contractors,
a high number of trips were either dropped or ran late. Consequently, a number of passengers
experienced times when their bus did not show. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 7.10
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 4.48 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 5.3% compared to the same period
in 2015. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible

Packet Pg. 67

1.C.7

passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2016 is 5.046 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015
was 5.32 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 6.9% compared to the same period
in 2015. This category was also impacted by the operator shortages. Additionally, improving on-time
performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2016 is 10.64 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 11.42
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 19.4% compared
to the same period in 2015. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam,
Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety
campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is
4.08 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 5.06 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 5.6% compared to the
same period in 2015. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 10.72 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2015 was 11.35 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 22.9% compared to the same
period in 2015. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 0.20 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2015 was 0.27 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 41.3% compared to the same
period in 2015. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment resulted in an increase in
complaints. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2016 is 1.34 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015
was 0.95 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 7.9% compared
to the same period in 2015. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a
regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In addition, the
on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held at the
private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of RTD
passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

Packet Pg. 68

1.C.7

following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is
8.69 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 8.06 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 31.0% compared to
the same period in 2015. The recent high turnover of operators has resulted in an increase in new
operators on routes. This in turn has contributed to the higher numbers in this category. The combined
efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street
Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with up-to-date information to answer
customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in the category for 2016 is 0.51
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 0.39 complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 2.1%
compared to the same period in 2015. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (77 of the total 2,038 = 3.8%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 11.26 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2015 was 11.03 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station and Commuter Rail Platform Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail and commuter rail 11platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons
contacted during the quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area
and conduct an on-board enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the
estimated fare evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests
made by police officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations
other than fare evasion. This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection
program as peace officers have the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law
enforcement action. This quarter the bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Enter into Contracts/Agreements to Contribute
Funding Towards the Mobility Choice Blueprint

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer and authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into
any and all contracts or agreements required to provide $500,000 in Regional Transportation District
funding in support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint as articulated in this Board Report.
BACKGROUND
At the June 14, 2016 Operations & Customer Service Committee meeting, RTD staff briefed the Board
regarding the efforts being led by the Denver Metro Chamber to undertake the Mobility Choice Blueprint
study effort. The Board was informed that RTD staff has been participating in discussions with the
Denver Metro Chamber, CDOT and DRCOG about forming a partnership to create an environment
embracing advanced transportation technologies to improve future mobility. To advance this goal, it is
proposed the partners fund a study, called the Mobility Choice Blueprint, to further understand the future
of transportation technology and what is needed to prepare the region for its inevitable expansion.
DISCUSSION
The stated purpose of the Mobility Choice Blueprint is to: Maximize existing investments in the metro
Denver transportation system by leveraging technology to meet future workforce mobility needs,
resulting in enhanced economic opportunity and quality of life. Attachment 1 details the purpose and
outcomes of the Mobility Choice Blueprint initiative.
Once the study is complete, the Blueprint, which includes a significant public involvement process,
would be used to recommend investment priorities for RTD, CDOT and DRCOG intended to assure that
the agency’s investments are well-coordinated and aligned to support future technological and related
advances in transportation. The Blueprint recommendations would not be binding on any participating
agency and it will be at the Board’s sole discretion to accept or pursue any of the plans or
recommendations contained within the report. The plan is for the study to initiate late in 2016 and to be
substantially complete by early 2018.
The Blueprint development would be overseen by a Mobility Choice Board of Directors and the Chamber
will finance the operations of the Board and hiring an executive director. The Board will be made up of
private and public sector leaders and RTD will be a member (See attachment 1 for a list of Board
member names and organizations). The estimated cost of the Blueprint study is $1.5 million and is
proposed to be equally shared among the three public agencies (DRCOG, CDOT and RTD).
Consequently, RTD’s share would be $500,000. The success of this endeavor is contingent on all three
public agencies contributing funding.

Packet Pg. 75

2.B.1

To date, CDOT and DRCOG have taken actions to secure their $500,000 shares. RTD Board approval of
this funding request will allow RTD to have an equal voice with our planning partners in the oversight,
direction and management of the Blueprint.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project is available from projects funds rolled forward from 2015 to 2016 that are no
longer required for that purpose and are available for this priority ($400,000) and expense funds from
the General Manager’s ($50,00) and CFO’s budgets ($50,000).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into
any and all contracts or agreements required to provide $500,000 in Regional Transportation District
funding in support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint as articulated in this Board Report.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not allocate $500,000 to the Mobility Choice Blueprint.
This action is not recommended as it would result in RTD not having a role in the study and could
run counter to RTD’s interests.

MOBILITY CHOICE BLUEPRINT INITIATIVE
FOR THE METRO DENVER AREA
How we move is changing. In the post-war history of mobility in our region, personal cars have
been central to nearly every trip. Getting a driver’s license was a major rite of passage for most
Americans, and owning a car was part of living the American dream. Accordingly, transportation
planning processes were built around that expectation, with a focus on maximizing and
increasing the amount of cars our roads can hold.
But technology is changing these values. Today, Americans spend on average 17 percent of
their household budgets on transportation, largely toward owning and maintaining a car.
Driving is an unproductive commitment of personal time. Meanwhile, connected cars are
already being produced, driverless cars are coming faster than anticipated and the sharing
economy is growing. With that, transportation planning must change.
We are proposing a mobility planning effort that takes into account the types of changes we are
experiencing due to advancing technology and shifting values. By uniting the public and private
sectors we can better plan for the mobility needs of our future workforce. If we don’t act now,
our growth and congestion could work against us when it comes to attracting tomorrow’s
employers.
The Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, the Colorado Department of Transportation, the
Regional Transportation District and the Denver Regional Council of Governments are ready to
embrace a new approach to planning for connected mobility in the metro Denver area.

Our Purpose
Maximize existing investments in the metro Denver transportation system by leveraging
technology to meet future workforce mobility needs, resulting in enhanced economic
opportunity and quality of life.

The Mobility Choice Organization
Mobility Choice is a partnership among the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, Colorado
Department of Transportation, Regional Transportation District, and Denver Regional Council of
Governments. Mobility Choice is the non-profit overseeing the preparation of the 2030
Blueprint, supporting a process and generating a document that will articulate how metro
Denver can join together public and private interests, incorporate technological change and
opportunity, and provide alignment for strategic transportation investment.

Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the Planning expense grant project budget to a new
capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek
consultant services for assistance in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
review and Advanced Basic Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project
was approved in the 2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining
funds are planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
BACKGROUND
RTD initiated the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), in April 2013. The purpose of the study
was to develop consensus among RTD, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Northwest-area stakeholders, including local jurisdictions and businesses, on cost effective and
efficient mobility improvements to serve the Northwest area. On June 24, 2014, the Board approved
a resolution which accepted the Final Consensus Statement as developed by the NAMS stakeholders
for priorities within the Northwest Study Area. One of the highest priorities, as described in the
Final Consensus Statement, was to proceed into advanced planning, environmental clearance and
preliminary engineering to establish Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor from Longmont
to Boulder.
As part of the 2040 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) process, the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) included the SH 119 BRT Corridor in the Fiscally Constrained 2040 RTP.
Inclusion of the corridor in the RTP is required before National Environmental Planning Act (NEPA)
clearance can be completed.
In order to advance this effort, DRCOG awarded RTD $1 million in Congestion Mitigation / Air
Quality grant funds for Fiscal Year 2016 to further environmental planning and engineering efforts in
the corridor. RTD would need to obligate these funds by September 2017 or risk losing the funding
to another project.
The cost to establish BRT in the corridor is estimated to be approximately $57 million in 2013
dollars. Staff assumes that grants will provide funding for approximately half of this cost. The
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) includes $60 million in Base System funds (with $30 million assumed to
be from grant sources) for construction of the corridor beginning in 2022.
This action fits within the General Manager Goal to Improve Service Delivery, specifically the sub
goal of enhancing or expanding operations, as the eventual completion of BRT in the SH 119 corridor
will increase service reliability, ridership and cost effectiveness of the service.

Packet Pg. 79

2.B.2

DISCUSSION
RTD will require extensive consultant services to complete the NEPA environmental clearances and
basic engineering prior to BRT construction in the SH 119 Corridor. Staff estimates those consultant
services to cost $3.5 million. RTD has received $1 million in DRCOG grant funds for Fiscal Year
2016 for this effort, with RTD providing the remainder of the project cost. Staff expects the effort
to span approximately 2.5 years, and these funds were programmed in the 2016 expense budget
and in the years 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 SBP to match the anticipated project schedule.
However, the full contract amount must be appropriated up front in order to issue a Request for
Proposals (RFP) because the project is a capital project. The budget transfer will allow staff to issue
an RFP for consultant services in November 2016 and award the contract in February, 2017. Based
on the 2.5 year schedule described above, the environmental clearances and basic engineering would
be completed by July 2019.
Should RTD pursue BRT construction in this corridor, as prioritized by the NAMS Final Consensus
Statement, the SH 119 BRT project would be subject to approval by a two-thirds vote of the RTD
Board. In addition, DRCOG SB 208 approval would be required as this project would be defined as a
rapid transit corridor project. The expectation is that the funding breakdown for future BRT
construction in the corridor would be as follows:



50 percent from RTD Base System Funds; and
50 percent from grant sources, such as DRCOG Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
funds, and/or Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Small Starts funding.

Project construction would occur within the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. And, as noted, future Board
action would be required to approve construction of BRT in this corridor.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding that will be used for this project is available from projects funds rolled forward from 2015 to
2016 that are no longer required for that purpose and are available for this priority. Because these funds
were programmed in 2017 and 2018 SBP, funds will be made available in those years by funding the
project now.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $3.5 million from the
Planning expense grant project budget to a new capital project for the SH 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) Corridor, which will permit staff to seek consultant services for assistance in
the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic
Engineering services. A total of $1.5 million in funding for this project was approved in the
2016 Amended Budget in the Planning expense grant budget, and the remaining funds are
planned for 2017 and 2018 in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at
this time. Instead, include this request as part of the 2017 Recommended Budget. This
action is not recommended since it will delay the procurement of consultant services for the
SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor by at least two months.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer;
instead wait until the full $3.5 million for consultant services is available in 2018 on the
schedule included in the SBP. This action is not recommended since it would delay

Packet Pg. 80

2.B.2

procurement of consultant services for the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor until early
2018 and would likely delay future construction of the corridor, thereby subjecting
construction to cost escalation. This action would likely cause the forfeiture of the $1 million
in DRCOG TIP funds, which were awarded to advance the NEPA / Basic Engineering effort in
the corridor, which would increase RTD’s local funding required to advance the project.
4. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer and
do not proceed forward with procuring consultant services to assist staff in the preparation of
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and Advanced Basic Engineering services for
the SH 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor. This action is not recommended given the
considerable commitment on the part of RTD and the Northwest Area stakeholders to reach
the consensus prioritizing SH 119 as the highest-priority BRT corridor in the Northwest Area.
Furthermore, this action would require RTD to forfeit $1 million in DRCOG TIP funds, which
were awarded to advance the NEPA / Basic Engineering effort in the corridor.

Purchase

Cybersecurity

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial, Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into contract negotiations with Parsons
Corporation to retain this firm for work order-based cybersecurity consulting services to support
RTD’s cybersecurity program. The estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract
of $1,818,700 includes security risk assessment, technical testing, control design, and control
implementation activities and will be funded from the cybersecurity operations and maintenance
budget approved for 2016 forward. Actual expenditures will be based on work orders constructed
and issued by the cybersecurity project team, but are not to exceed the total budgeted for this
contract.
BACKGROUND
The Cybersecurity Manager and IT leadership require the support of a qualified subcontracting firm to
uncover and address security deficiencies and improve the sustainability of security controls within
RTD’s technology environment. RTD has identified cybersecurity as a priority for 2016 and onward,
and with good reason: assessments from 2014, 2015, and 2016 revealed that some of RTD’s
critical systems require some level of retrofit in order to secure them to the latest industry standards.
Designing and implementing ongoing, sustainable security controls that keep RTD’s technology
secure and well-monitored reduces the risk of operational disruptions that could result in loss of
service to our customers, reduces the risk of a breach of confidential information, and enhances the
overall safety and reliability of our system.
This work order contract will allow RTD to retain the services of a single security firm and their team
of technical consultants to assist with the implementation of RTD-defined cybersecurity projects.
Service categories included in the scope of the contract include:
 Security Risk Assessment
 Security Technical Testing (Vulnerability Testing or Penetration Testing)
 Security Control Design
 Security Control Implementation
Despite the best efforts of the onboard cybersecurity staff, RTD requires external assistance to fully
and effectively address control and compliance gaps that were identified in past years’ assessments
as well as continue to mature the cybersecurity program. The primary areas targeted for continued
assessment and enhancement, such as control systems and fare collection systems, employ
specialized technologies and/or are subject to regulatory compliance requirements. Security
assessment and control design in these areas requires the involvement of personnel with specific
certifications and expertise that RTD does not presently have on staff. Security control
implementation furthermore requires a full-time dedicated project team to make reasonable progress
in retrofitting security controls to our existing environments as well as to develop self-sustaining
systems and processes to ensure systems do not fall into disrepair.

Packet Pg. 82

2.B.3

Parsons can not only provide the required certified expertise, but also bring to bear the necessary
volume of technical resources needed to plan and implement security improvements in a timely
manner. Parsons’ staff will work in conjunction with and at the direction of RTD’s Cybersecurity
Manager and Senior IT Security Analyst to ensure their efforts align with RTD’s agency-wide, IT, and
cybersecurity objectives and that resulting processes and maintenance recommendations are
realistically executable by RTD’s current and future staff following the project closure.
DISCUSSION
The intent of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract is to provide a vehicle to engage
skilled cybersecurity resources using an abbreviated procurement process (work orders) in order to
maintain the necessary engagement agility to meet the District’s needs with a firm with whom we
can build a consistent, sustained relationship anchored by our cybersecurity program objectives. Past
major assessments and security retrofits within the RTD technology environment, such as the
assessment and improvements to the fare collection environments, were individually contracted on a
project-by-project basis to outside firms. It was discovered through this experience that the general
Request for Proposal process was neither agile enough, nor was contractor engagement consistent
and sustained enough, for RTD to react in a timely manner to urgent security needs driven by
business problems or incidents, or to benefit holistically from security program improvements. The
work order process will allow us to collapse wait times and sustain program development efforts by
working with one pre-approved retained firm.
Following RTD’s Procurement process, the Information Technology department issued a Request for
Proposal to identify a qualified cybersecurity firm. A selection committee evaluated and identified the
best candidate, Parsons Corporation, to meet RTD’s needs. The proposed partnership would allow
RTD to retain Parsons for an initial period of two (2) years with an option to extend services for three
(3) individual years, for a total potential contract period of five (5) years. Given that this is a work
order contract, it will be RTD’s responsibility construct, issue, and negotiate individual work orders
with Parsons for specific security services over the course the engagement period.
The requested funds include tiered consultant staff hours (i.e. project manager, senior, specialist,
intermediate, and junior) that were estimated by RTD as needed to support RTD projects among the
aforementioned service categories at the time the proposal was drafted. Actual expenditures for the
engagement will be determined by the type, scope, and number of work orders issued by RTD and
vetted by Parsons, though they shall not exceed RTD’s total budgeted amounts.
It is worth noting that the current RTD cybersecurity team consists of the Cybersecurity Manager
and the recently added Senior IT Security Analyst, both reporting the Information Technology
department. This team will provide direction and leadership to the contracted consultants. It is
expected that as RTD’s internal cybersecurity resources increase, reliance on the external contracting
firm will decrease over time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total estimated cost of the Cybersecurity Services Work Order Contract, with options, is
$1,818,700. This amount bridges the five (5) year potential contract period. For 2016 and 2017,
$758,200 of the total amount (the base cost) was budgeted and approved for this purpose via the
Strategic Budget Planning process. Future years’ operating expenses will be reflected in future
years’ Strategic Budget Plan.

Packet Pg. 83

2.B.3

Any additional funding planned or anticipated to implement hardware or software improvements
recommended by the consultant technical team to improve security are separately budgeted in the
appropriate category (capital or expense) for 2017 forward.
ALTERNATIVES
The available alternatives include:
 Approve the work order contract with Parsons Corporation. This is the recommended action
to ensure that RTD has the immediately available and consistent support of a qualified
cybersecurity contractor to meet current and future needs.
 Increase internal cybersecurity staffing. At least five (5) immediate full time employees will be
required to fulfill the service and skill requirements that would otherwise be fulfilled by the
work order contract. While it is recommended that we augment the internal cybersecurity
team over time, foregoing services in favor of staffing is not the recommended action because
current employment market conditions may make it difficult to find qualified staff in the near
term, and our security improvement efforts will consequently be indefinitely delayed.
 Do not approve the contract with Parsons Corporation and do not increase cybersecurity
staffing (do nothing). This is not the recommended action because the onboard staff does not
currently have the human capacity to perform the identified security improvement work in a
timely, effective manner, and RTD requires specialized skill sets to complete some of the
necessary work.

2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
This action item meets policy requirements and the General Manager’s goals of Fiscal
Sustainability/Financial Plan by effecting current and long-range budgeting in a timely manner.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement states that “On an annual basis, RTD will
prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the SBP
serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed to
support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal and
interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District. The
other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time period.
These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have adequate
resources to meet cash flow needs.
Per RTD Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (one year), medium term (SBP) and long term
(FasTracks APE). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds School of Business for this
service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement; projects are constrained to
operate within the forecast of revenues and funding sources available for their completion and operation.

Packet Pg. 85

2.B.4

The SBP also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal funding. RTD
cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are included in the TIP.
The 2017-2022 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2017-2022 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2016 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and best
estimates at this time. The SBP was presented to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee on
August 9th for discussion; final presentation follows on September 20th with staff recommendation for
Board adoption on September 27th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2017-2022 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2016 Amended Budget.
The column titled “Adjusted Amended Budget 2016” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and by amendment
to the Amended Budget, and subsequent known items.
The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections 1) the March
sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, 2) minimum/must-have SBP requested
projects including minimum fleet requirements, 3) reductions, eliminations or deferrals of non-critical
SBP requested projects, 4) use of the Capital Acquisition reserve fund to support planned fleet
purchases, 5) restoration of reserve funds, and 6) no new debt issued. No service reductions are
proposed in the SBP through this period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2017-2022 projected cash flow activity based on the staff recommendation
incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $117.5 million in 2017 is projected to be unchanged from 2016. The
year 2016 is budgeted to have an 8% fare revenue increase due to the fare rate
restructure and increase. Future fare revenue increases are planned for 2019 and 2022
per the Board policy of consideration of a 10% fare rate increase every 3 years. After
2016, which contains a 1.5% ridership increase, the SBP conservatively assumes no
increase in ridership through 2022. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds School of
Business for the years 2016-2022. The year 2016 is budgeted using the low growth
Below-Trend forecast and years 2017-2022 is projected using the medium growth
Baseline forecast. (Line 2)
o CU-Leeds presents probabilistic high and low forecast bounds in their forecasts that
incorporate possible errors, computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a
0.67 probability exists that the interval between low and high forecast values will
contain the actual value of the variable being predicted. The upper bound estimate
is 6.8% higher than the medium baseline forecast. This shows that it is not
impossible or unrealistic that revenue could grow somewhat strongly over the next
2 years. Likewise, economic threats pose downside risk to the forecast with a
6.8% lower bound.

Packet Pg. 86

2.B.4



Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known proceeds,
and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer Price
Index (CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2017. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and then adjusted for known items and
necessary reductions. The area CPI rates follow: (Line 6)
2017:
3.0%
2018:
3.1%
2019:
3.0%
2020:
2.7%
2021:
2.7%
2022:
2.7%
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be operated
by RTD in years 2016-2019 to include service enhancements on Routes L and 324, Route
73 extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and Anschutz Medical Campus
Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP. RTD costs will be reimbursed in
full by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from the applicable municipalities.
Determination will be made in future years whether to continue such service at RTD’s
cost. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide I-225, the H-Line
extension and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource drivers on a
full-allocation basis in years 2017-2022, and thus, Base total expenses are reduced by the
amount of the allocation. In years prior to 2017, the allocation was made on an
incremental basis, to be changed to full allocation including administrative and support
costs beginning in 2017. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2017 plus an adjustment at the CPI in to capture current higher costs, and then escalated
at the CPI rate for 2018-2022. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at an estimated lock price of $2.00/gallon in 2017 and then
escalated at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2018:
3.0%
2019:
2.8%
2020:
2.5%
2021:
2.3%
2022:
2.3%
 Gasoline is forecast at $2.65/gallon in 2017 based on recent average prices plus an
upward adjustment, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
 In the line item for expense projects (O&M), the following are included: 1) specifically
identified minimum/must-have operating and maintenance projects (also termed “expense
projects”), detailed in Exhibit III, 2) an amount for new operating projects brought into the
SBP based on available cash flow; specific projects will be determined from the deferred
project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 11)
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 12)
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)

Packet Pg. 87

2.B.4

 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year (for
current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization schedules. Interest
expense is forecast only on existing debt balances because the plan assumes no new debt
issued through 2022. (Line 16)
 In the line item for capital expenditures, the following are included: 1) specifically identified
minimum/must-have capital projects plus the minimum required new fleet, detailed in Exhibit
II; dollar amounts of the new fleet will be determined so as not to exceed cash flow
constraints determined in the SBP model, 2) an amount for new capital projects brought into
the SBP based on available cash flow; specific projects will be determined from the deferred
project list in Exhibit IV, and 3) COP- or bond-funded carry-forward capital expenditures. (Line
19)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement establishes a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund.
 Staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund be maintained at a
minimum of $3 million each year until the fund reaches a balance of $35 million, projected
to occur in 2021. (Lines 20 and 33)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund be refunded nominally to $2.7 million
in 2017 per available cash flow, used in years 2018-2020 for fleet purchases, then
replenished to $20 million in 2021 and the entire balance used to support fleet
expenditures in 2022. Per the 2016 Amended Budget, the capital replacement fund was
used in its entirety in 2016 for fleet acquisition. (Lines 21 and 34)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including revenue
shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve is established in 2017 and funded with available
cash flow. The plan will apply available dollars toward the operating fund so it reaches a
minimum $25 million in 2020, and reaches $46.4 million in 2022. (Lines 22 and 35)
 The Board-appropriated fund and unrestricted operating reserve fund (and not the capital
acquisition fund) in total are projected to reach $81.4 million in 2022.
 A placeholder is established for Transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of FasTracks
operations. Any transfer to FasTracks is not expected to occur until after 2022. (Line 23)
 Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in
accordance with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund. No
new debt is issued during the SBP term in order to maintain required debt service coverage.
(Line 25)
 Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (for current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization
schedules. Principal payments are forecast only on existing debt balances. (Line 26)
 Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at 12/31/15,
estimated changes to restricted reserves, and the use of previously-issued COP-bond proceeds
for future year capital expenditures. (Lines 29, 30, and 31)
 The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance. The objective is to maintain a nominal unrestricted year-end fund balance of $2
million each year through 2022 while supporting a minimum critical level of capital and
expense projects and building reserve fund balances. (Line 32)

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts are
reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance in each year of the SBP while substantially growing reserve fund balances. However,
uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and supplies, as well
as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the SBP and may challenge staff to present
new options and solutions during the 2017 budget period.

ALTERNATIVES

Packet Pg. 89

2.B.4

1. Adoption of the 2017-2022 SBP, incorporating all items currently in the recommendation by staff and
the other items identified above. This is the recommended action.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2017-2022 SBP to a later date. This is not recommended because the SBP
identifies the capital programs, expenditures, and service guidelines for the 2017 budget process and
adoption of the SBP serves as a confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2017 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2017-2022 SBP.
This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the SBP adoption and possible delay in the
2017 budget process.

In 2013, Rail Operations and the Planning Department
Districtwide
determined that eighteen (18) Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs)
would need to be purchased in order to meet the demands of
the existing LRT system and accommodate the opening of the
I-225 line in 2016. This analysis led to the current
procurement of twelve (12) vehicles that was included in the
2015-2017 capital budget plan. In order to bring the spare
ratio to a desired 20% minimum and meet the anticipated
growth in ridership, we need to purchase seventeen (17)
additional vehicles by 2020 (2 will be purchased by
FasTracks). This will increase the fleet from 184 to 201. The
order for these vehicles was placed in 2015.

In the years of 2016 and 2017, RTD will receive a FASTER
grant stipend from CDOT for State of Good Repair type
projects. These funds will be used to fund RTD projects that
would otherwise have been funded by RTD Base system
funds. However, as part of this stipend, CDOT expects RTD to
provide an additional $150,000 of grants to local governments
for transit projects. The funds from this SBP request will be
added to the SBP Local Government pool so that RTD can
meet the terms of the FASTER stipend and have a meaningful
pool of funds to respond to local government requests.

Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a
technology consisting of computer components and recording
media used to retain digital information. It is a core function
and fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates raw
information by performing computations. In practice, almost
all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and
slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.
In computing, a portfolio of storage products, including online
storage, near-online (nearline) storage, storage networking,
archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software are
required to run the Enterprise.

Server with newer version of Exadata servers available in
2020. The Exadata database servers host the Oracle Ebusiness suite databases( HR/ FINANCE/ PROCUREMENT/
BUDGET/ GRANTS/ PROJECTS, etc.). The Exadata
database servers also host the TIES, CAD/AVL/REALTIME

applications will benefit and will be supported on the new
Exadata Servers. 2. Replace 3 Exalogic X3-2 application
Servers with 3 Exalogic X5-2 servers in 2018 .
TIES/REALTIME/SINGLE SIGN-ON/CONTENT SERVER/

Office
our riders in timely manner. The system will include a webbased interface that allows staff to create and manage the
thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The
Alert System will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple
alerts to be created in seconds. At the same time, the system
will offer fine-grained control over selecting the specific route,
branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in
effect, and by what channels (like emails, text messages,
electronic signs, agency website, General Transit Feed
Specification real-time feeds and third party apps) the alerts
should be disseminated. The system will use templates to
automatically generate appropriate messages for all the
dissemination channels.

Mobile Ticketing

This project is a GM initiative to enhance fare products by
Blake Street
offering a mobile application for the purchase and use of fare Office
and parking products. Mobile ticketing applications are
available from many third parties and can be used on any
mobile device. There is very little need for infrastructure or
customization of software. A user simply downloads the
mobile ticketing application to their device and purchases and
manages any of RTD's fare products or pays for parking. The
user purchases the product needed with a credit card and
receives the value of their payment on their mobile device for
immediate use. The user then activates (validates) each ride
by simply selecting the fare product to be used each time a
boarding occurs. The mobile application vendor maintains the
software and is the administrator of payments thereby
meeting PCI compliance. Any of RTD's fare products may be
used with mobile ticketing which offers a single, convenient
source and use of products. The vendor manages the data
and payments and sends a single payment for all transactions
during a given time period to RTD. Vendors also provide data
and analytical tools regarding the transactions on the
application. Industry standards for cost structure are an initial
small set-up fee then a % of mobile ticketing sales.

CCTV Retrofit on LRV

This project is requested to replace 189 LRV CCTV recorders Districtwide
and cameras that have surpassed their useful lives and install
new system configuration. This retrofit has been designed to
match CCTV systems that are currently specified within the
new bus orders for standardization. These modern systems
also provide the ability to remotely retrieve video from the
Security Command Center. Installation includes a complete
removal of old analog systems and re-wiring to work with new
digital technology. This includes new mobile network video
server/recorder, high definition cameras, mobile network
switches, and mobile routers. In addition, the LRVs are to be
outfitted with forward facing and cab operation cameras to aid
in the investigations of accidents. Forward facing cameras will
assist by providing information as to the status of signals,
switches and crossings as vehicles move along the rail
system. This request is to provide funding to complete the
upgrades over a period of 5 years.

the base Security Command Center. This project is to add
redundant capabilities for disaster recovery. These
redundancies will be located in a separate location to protect
the District from a catastrophic loss of video evidence if a
flood, fire or other event occurred.

This project will include all of the downtown track and
Central Rail Line
infrastructure from 7th street to 30th and Downing. This
alignment is 22 years old and has been in service since
inception. For the most part this infrastructure has reached its
potential lifespan. There are several projects in place to make
repairs and replace the worst of the defects but an overall
plan is needed to replace all track, turnout switches, street
crossings, concrete flat work, etc. Please see the attached
report from MOW and SGR, highlighting the condition of the
infrastructure in the area. This is a six year plan. The
alignment will be divided into segments that can be
completely refurbished within the span of one construction
season. Our estimates are at a cost of $2,000,000 per year
for 6 years.
Many of the existing metal halide, glow top, pole light fixtures Southwest Rail
in the pedestrian areas on 12’ poles have been damaged from Line
hail over the past 3 to 4 years. The fixture is obsolete and the
lenses are not made any longer. Replacement will be made
with LED fixtures.

Request is to proceed with the Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Colfax - East Project. RTD has received a Federal Ladders of Opportunity ITS
grant to fund a capital project to reduce travel time and
increase security and ridership for 15L bus route. The project
includes: stop amenity improvements (repair and replace
existing amenities, lighting, shelters, security cameras), bus
bulbs at a few locations, transit signal priority (TSP), and
bypass lanes/queue jumps. The project includes East Colfax
from Broadway east to Potomac (near I-225). It is important to
note that from Yosemite to Potomac, the project will only
include improved stop amenities. RTD's remaining local
match is $1.5M.

Bus Rapid Transit @ SH Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor to connect Boulder and Line
119
Longmont in accordance with the recommendation of the
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). It is anticipated that
approximately half of the total costs for this project would be
grant-funded. The establishment of BRT in the corridor would
raise ridership from approximately 1,900 to approximately
5,000 daily weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates
and design will be established through the upcoming
environmental clearance study and preliminary engineering,
previously approved in the SBP. The project is anticipated to
take two years to construct.

Property Survey
Records System-Wide

Currently whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any
Districtwide
property right (fee simple, easement, or license agreement), it
utilizes an external survey firm (Jacobs) to establish the
location of that property right on the ground, and prepare
Right-of-Way maps, legal descriptions and exhibits. The
contract with Jacobs will expire at the end of 2016. Jacobs
has surveys, Computer Aided Design (CAD) files, information
on adjoining properties, subdivision plats, ALTA surveys, legal
descriptions, and other electronic and paper records
regarding RTD properties going back to 1997. The extent of
this information is estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which
could be equated to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of
information. These documents also include information on
utilities that cross or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-nRides, and other properties.

This project is to sort through Jacobs property survey records,
bring this information within RTD, and organize it on an
engineering GIS platform. Initially, the system will house
information on properties, utilities, track, pnRs, crossings, and
structures. The system can be expanded to include other
items such as catenary system. The property survey
information is critical to the system and needs to be brought
within RTD. This project will strengthen the foundation of
many District-wide efforts by obtaining and organizing RTD
property rights, utility, and other information in an easily

Project Description

DRCOG, through the Transportation Improvement Program
Districtwide
(TIP), has allocated $1 million in funding for FY 2017 for this
project. RTD would be required to provide a 25 percent local
match of $250,000. Given the results of the Northwest Area
Mobility Study, which showed substantial bus ridership
increases from modest capital improvements made to arterial
corridors, there has been much interest from other areas of
the District for RTD to make arterial BRT investments in other
corridors. The purpose of this study will be to examine the
potential for arterial BRT investments throughout the entire
District and prioritize for future capital investment those
corridors which perform the highest.

The ADA Manager continues to boost involvement on
accessible design (plan reviews, site visits, and inspections)
District-wide. The need for a perspective on accessible design
has been well received and needs more and continued
attention and support. This proactive approach ensures
compliance and mitigates potential problems. This
effort/involvement has been effective in identifying and
preventing costly and litigious issues from escalating, but
efforts are spread thin and not all projects receive this type of
attention.
Currently whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any property Districtwide
right (fee simple, easement, or license agreement), it utilizes
an external survey firm (Jacobs) to establish the location of
that property right on the ground, and prepare Right-of-Way
maps, legal descriptions and exhibits. The contract with
Jacobs will expire at the end of 2016. Jacobs has surveys,
Computer Aided Design (CAD) files, information on adjoining
properties, subdivision plats, ALTA surveys, legal
descriptions, and other electronic and paper records regarding
RTD properties going back to 1997. The extent of this
information is estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which could be
equated to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of information.
These documents also include information on utilities that
cross or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-n-Rides, and
other properties.
Organizations that have assets in various geographic
locations typically utilize Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) to record and analyze their asset base. Utilities and local
municipalities are examples of such organizations. RTD has
been using GIS systems for about 15 years. Currently, these
systems are used mostly used by the Telephone Information
Center (TIC), Scheduling (Transtar), and CAD/AVL. RTD is
also getting started on projects like real-time train arrival
information, which would also need GIS support.

In November 2015, the Board approved a contract with IQBG
to serve as the owner's representative for ECM
implementation. The scope of the IQBG contract starts with
development of the background and requirements for ECM
implementation, including policies and procedures, consistent
taxonomy (named) and metadata structure (data definitions),
and functional and technical requirements and capabilities.
Based on these requirements, IQBG will develop
recommendations for a path forward, which is scheduled to be
approved in September 2016. Procurement of the
recommended alternative would begin in the fourth quarter of
2016.

Information Storage Unit RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all
District information and computing services. A wide range of
Replacement
departments and applications use these storage units to store
mission-critical data.
Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a
technology consisting of computer components and recording
media used to retain digital information. It is a core function
and fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates raw
information by performing computations. In practice, almost all
computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and
slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.
In computing, a portfolio of storage products, including online
storage, near-online (nearline) storage, storage networking,
archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software are
required to run the Enterprise.

Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System Blake Street
in order to communicate up-to-the-minute service alerts for our Office
riders in timely manner. The system will include a web-based
interface that allows staff to create and manage the thousands
of service alerts that are sent out each year. The Alert System
will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be
created in seconds. At the same time, the system will offer finegrained control over selecting the specific route, branch, trip,
or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in effect, and by
what channels (like emails, text messages, electronic signs,
agency website, General Transit Feed Specification real-time
feeds and third party apps) the alerts should be disseminated.
The system will use templates to automatically generate
appropriate messages for all the dissemination channels.
The Alert System will include a web-based interface that is
used by staff to create and manage service alerts. Key
features of the interface will include:
● General:
○ Integration with RTD website, email communications, text
communications, etc.
○ Intuitive and fast-to-use interface
○ Differentiation between detour, disruption, emergency,
service change, event detour, etc.
○ Ability to send out stop, route, branch, trip alerts

This project is a GM initiative to enhance fare products by
Blake Street
offering a mobile application for the purchase and use of fare Office
and parking products. Mobile ticketing applications are
available from many third parties and can be used on any
mobile device. There is very little need for infrastructure or
customization of software. A user simply downloads the
mobile ticketing application to their device and purchases and
manages any of RTD's fare products or pays for parking. The
user purchases the product needed with a credit card and
receives the value of their payment on their mobile device for
immediate use. The user then activates (validates) each ride
by simply selecting the fare product to be used each time a
boarding occurs. The mobile application vendor maintains the
software and is the administrator of payments thereby meeting
PCI compliance. Any of RTD's fare products may be used with
mobile ticketing which offers a single, convenient source and
use of products. The vendor manages the data and payments
and sends a single payment for all transactions during a given
time period to RTD. Vendors also provide data and analytical
tools regarding the transactions on the application. Industry
standards for cost structure are an initial small set-up fee then
a % of mobile ticketing sales.

RTD needs technology to operate efficiently and to compete
Civic Center
effectively. But as reliance on IT grows, the resources needed Plaza (CCP)
to support this increasingly complex IT environment may not.
In many areas, IT resources are limited and can be quickly
overwhelmed. We have seen from prior instances that if we
fall behind in keeping up with things such as backups, patches
and security, the odds greatly increase that RTD will face an
IT outage or another problem down the road that will
negatively impact RTD business. For instance, once RTD rolls
out real-time information to the customer and we have an
outage, it will negatively impact customers' view of RTD.
Another example is constantly keeping up to date with security
patches which, if not applied, will leave security vulnerabilities
open in the system. Managed Services support will help IT to
keep current with all these patches on a regular basis.

With the expansion of staff, represented employees, vehicles
and Light Rail lines, coupled with the ongoing challenges of
hiring new qualified mechanics, a robust training program is
essential. Part of this program needs to incorporate an ELearing system such as what Xpan offers (see attachment)
that is all-encompassing plus specific to the diagnostic details
of the SD160 fleet the we own. It can also aid in filling the gap
between an unqualified mechanic helper to an electromechanic.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather
Copp,

Date:

September 12, 2016

Subject:

Discussion and Action of the 2016 Annual
Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 13, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 27, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan as outlined below.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenditures to date and all planned expenditures through the
year 2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for boardapproved projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction, the major effort of the
APE has shifted from developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the
Board-approved budgets for those projects and ensuring that RTD will have the future financial capacity
to operate the corridors and meet its debt service obligations. Therefore, the FasTracks financial plan
provides an overall long-term financial plan for RTD, and includes forecasts for both FasTracks and the
base system through 2040. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2015 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.6 billion, and approximately
$4.3 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2015.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction and are being managed
within the Board approved budgets, the project cost changes to this APE are relatively small. The
changes primarily reflect updates to project scope and timing, or work that has been completed under
budget, as shown on the attached presentation (Attachment A).
The project cost changes for the 2016 APE are summarized below:





Changes to the timing and project scope for the US 36 BRT:
o Funding for BRT vehicle enhancements deferred from 2018 until 2030 to coincide with
the replacement of the current bus fleet
o Deferral of the Church Ranch platform relocation
o Addition of additional vertical circulation at the Broomfield station, to be completed by
2018
Increase in unit cost for the additional light rail vehicles
Additional funds required for project closeout staffing

Packet Pg. 116

2.B.5







Projects with environmental and planning work completed under the 2015 APE budget:
o Northwest Rail Segment 2
o Southwest Corridor Extension
o Central Corridor Extension
Other projects completed under the APE budget:
o Existing Corridor Improvements (Southeast, Central, CPV)
o Railroad ROW
o Communication System Upgrades
o Northeast Area Transportation Evaluation (NATE)
Reduction in program wide capital costs

Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the APE is
a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes approved by
the Board are incorporated.
The FasTracks financial plan incorporates updated revenue forecasts that show a decrease in short and
medium-term revenue forecasts for both FasTracks and the base system. With these updated forecasts,
annual revenues are projected to be lower than the 2015 APE forecasts in each year through 2025. In
addition, the total cumulative revenue forecast is lower than the 2015 APE forecast through 2034.
Between 2035 and 2040, total forecast revenues are projected to be higher than the 2015 forecast.
This reduced revenue forecast is expected to have multiple impacts on the financial plan. RTD’s net
debt service coverage is expected to be close to the 1.20x Board policy limit through 2022. As a result,
once the remaining FasTracks debt approved in May 2016 is issued, RTD will not have the capacity to
issue additional bonds or Certificates of Participation (COPs) until 2023.
In 2012, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) was established and “all funding identified
through the process will be added to the FISA until enough funding is accumulated to complete and
operate additional projects.” In addition to completing and operating additional projects, the specific
project goals of the FISA were to:
 Complete the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project:
 Construct North Metro to at least 72nd;
 Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion)
However, in 2021 through 2024 all FISA funds available will be needed to fund FasTracks corridor
operations and maintenance. In 2024 through 2030 base system funding is also needed to fund
FasTracks operations and maintenance. After 2030, FasTracks revenues are projected to cover all
operations and maintenance of the FasTracks corridors. At that time, positive fund balances begin to
accumulate on both the base system and FasTracks, with the larger share accumulating on the base
system.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The project cost changes in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation are projected to result in a total cost
savings of $14.7 million. Approximately $1.2 million of these savings will be offset by the loss of a
CDOT FASTER grant for the Church Ranch platform relocation. The net savings of $13.5 million will be
restored to the FISA between 2016 and 2018.

After listening to input from the Board and stakeholder, the staff recommended option is the modified
baseline option. It is listed below (See Attachment B).








Need to take a total of $130.8 million from the base system in 2024-2030 to balance FasTracks
Issue COPs in base system in 2023 for $59.2 million for bus purchases. All other base capital
expenditures through 2040 are pay-go
Build Board appropriated and operating reserves in base systems to maintain equivalent of 3
months of operating reserves consistently through 2040
FISA is utilized to fund FasTracks operations and maintenance in years 2021-2024
Keep FasTracks reserves equivalent to 3 months O&M
As FasTracks unrestricted balances start to accumulate in 2031, those balances are transferred
to the FISA. No balances are transferred in years 2038 or 2039 as funds are need to fund
FasTracks EIS commitments
At year-end 2040, Base System unrestricted fund balance is projected to be $1,317.2 million,
FISA is projected to be $518.1 million, and FasTracks unrestricted fund balance is projected to be
$21.5 million for a total projected balance of $1,856.8 million

Funding from the FISA and FasTracks unrestricted fund balances would be used to fund the remaining
unfunded FasTracks corridors which have not been prioritized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan, incorporating the recommendation by staff.
This is the recommended action.
2. Adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan, incorporating the original baseline
recommendation by staff. This is not the recommendation action.
3. Defer the adoption of the 2016 APE and Financial Plan to a later date. This is not the
recommendation action. The financial plan must be adopted by the Board in September in
order to deliver the financial plan to the rating agencies. The rating agencies require the
financial plan in order to issue bond ratings to RTD. Those ratings are required for our
upcoming bond sale in October. Delaying approval would delay the bond sale, which could
lead to an undesirable cash position.

Board Meeting Date: September 20, 2016

BACKGROUND
Staff is required to present the 2017 Requested Budget to the Board of Directors prior to posting
it for public inspection. RTD must post its 2017 Requested Budget for public review and
comment by October 15, 2016 in order to meet Colorado legal requirements (CRS 29-1-101).
The preliminary 2017 Requested Budget is included in this document in order to comply with
these requirements.
At this time, Staff is presenting the preliminary first draft 2017 Requested Budget. Preliminary
2017 Requested Budget numbers are subject to further revision and a budget update will be
presented at the October 18th Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting. The 2017
Recommended Budget will then be presented at the November 15th Financial Administration and
Audit Committee meeting with Staff requesting approval to move to the Board of Directors for
ratification of the 2017 Adopted Budget on November 22nd.
DISCUSSION
The Board has requested that staff keep it informed on key budget issues that RTD is facing and
provide opportunities for Board members to offer early input during the development of the 2017
annual budget. Our previous communication included the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP), the first year of which forms the basis for the 2017 budget and which is scheduled to be
approved by the Board on September 27th. The budget is driven by the three top strategic goals
established for the GM by the Board of Directors for 2017, which consist of fiscal sustainability,
workforce/human capital, and state of good repair.
During development of the 2017-2022 SBP for the Base System, staff presented a balanced
budget to the Board for 2017. Staff has worked to develop a preliminary proposed budget for
the Base System as set forth in the 2017-2022 SBP. Staff also incorporates FasTracks budget
numbers for both FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations. The FasTracks budget is
developed separately from the SBP in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE). Both the Base
System and FasTracks preliminary budget make up the 2017 Requested Budget presented here.
The 2017 Requested Budget is compared to the 2016 Re-Amended Budget below with change
from period to period (in thousands). The summary data is from the attached Exhibit I.

Overview
The 2017 Requested Budget is a first draft budget and includes estimates for sources and uses.
The budget items will continue to be reviewed and the final version incorporating any necessary
adjustments will be the 2017 Recommended Budget scheduled for adoption in November. This
Requested Budget will be updated for items such as fare revenue estimates, sales taxes, grant
revenue, and capital expenditures for both new capital and capital carry forward amounts.
Operating expenses will likely be revised for specific changes.
As stated earlier, staff has developed the 2017 Requested Budget based on guidance from the
SBP for 2017 for the Base System and by incorporating the FasTracks 2017 budget. The 2017
Requested Budget on a combined basis includes the following:

Packet Pg. 139

2.C.1

(1) Fare revenue:
a. Farebox revenue for the Base System is expected to show no increase over 2016.
For FasTracks, fare revenue is budgeted to increase by $20.2 million to $32.9
million in 2017 due to full-year operation of the FasTracks service corridors brought
on-line in 2016. Overall farebox revenue is budgeted at $150.4 million in 2017.
Ridership growth is expected to be flat as well on the Base System with any
ridership increases attributed to FasTracks. Ridership projections are derived from
RTD’s planning model and the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation.
(2) Other operating revenue:
a. This amount includes advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, rental income, and
miscellaneous operating revenue.
b. Other operating revenue is increased at the CPI over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget
and adjusted for known items. The amount will change if more information
becomes available for the 2017 Recommended Budget. The current run rate for
other operating revenue is generally on track with the 2016 budget.
(3) Sales/use tax:
a. Combined sales/use tax of $601.9 million is budgeted to increase 5.6% over the
2016 projection, concurrent with the CU-Leeds School of Business March forecast.
The 2017 growth rate is the CU-Leeds Baseline forecast.
b. The 2016 projection shows an increase in sales/use tax of 5.2% over 2015
actuals; this is the CU-Leeds School of Business Below Trend forecast.
c. The September update from CU-Leeds School will be incorporated in the 2017
Recommended Budget.
(4) Grant revenue:
a. Total grant revenue is estimated at $317.7 million, a decrease of $37.2 million
from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.
b. Operating grant revenue is $89.6 million the Base System and $2.5 million for
FasTracks. Base System operating grant revenue is budgeted to decrease $5.6
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to fluctuations in funding in fixed
guideway, bus facilities funding, CMAQ, CDOT, and FASTER grant funding for
specific programs. FasTracks operating grant revenue is budgeted to increase $0.9
million due to an increase in CMAQ funding for the Eagle Project offset by a
decrease in STAMPS grants.
c. Remaining grant funds consist of capital grant revenue of $225.5 million. Of this
amount, $15.7 million is budgeted in the Base System and $209.8 million is
budgeted in FasTracks. Combined capital grant revenue is expected to decrease
$32.6 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget with most of that coming from a
decrease in CMAQ grants for FasTracks.
d. Capital grant revenue does not include carry forward grants at this time. As more
information becomes available and the capital carry forward budget is finalized,
capital grant revenue estimates will change accordingly in the Recommended
Budget.
(5) Investment income:
a. Combined investment income totaling $4.2 million is projected to be largely flat
from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to continued low short term rates along
with deployment of invested funds. Unrestricted investable fund balances are
projected to decline as project funds are drawn down for fleet purchases and
construction projects. An expected small increase in interest rates will stabilize
investment income.

Packet Pg. 140

2.C.1

(6) Other (non-operating) income:
a. Other non-operating income will decrease from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due
to non-recurrence of $9.0 million released from TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by
full-year payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line and
an increase in DUS rental income.
b. Recurring non-operating revenue is increased at the CPI (with the exception of the
Build America Bonds subsidy) over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The amount will
change if more information becomes available for the 2017 Recommended Budget.
The current run rate for other income is generally on track with the 2016 budget.
(7) Operating expenses:
a. District-wide operating expenses (including expense projects) of $607.9 million are
budgeted to decrease $30.3 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base
System operating expenses are budgeted to decrease $7.3 million, FasTracks
Project expenses are budgeted to decrease $43.6 million, and FasTracks Operations
expenses are budgeted to increase $20.6 million. Base System operating expenses
at this time are target amounts derived from the SBP but may change in the final
2017 budget as deemed necessary.
b. Note that the expense projects carry forward (previously approved expense
projects) is not included in the 2017 Requested Budget; this will be identified and
included in the final 2017 budget.
c. FasTracks Capital Programs will account for $42.5 million of the decline in
FasTracks Project expenses due in large part to completion of several FasTracks
projects.
d. Costs of operating the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide, I-225, the
H-Line extension and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource
drivers on a full-allocation basis in 2017, and thus, Base System total expenses are
reduced by the amount of the allocation. In years prior to 2017, the allocation was
made on an incremental basis, to be changed to full allocation including
administrative and support costs beginning in 2017. The amount of the allocation
in 2017 is $36.8 million.
e. FasTracks Operations also includes a $71.2 million estimated service payment to
Denver Transit Operators for Eagle operations and maintenance which began in
2016. The expense is included in the Rail Operations budget.
f. Diesel fuel is budgeted at $2.00/gallon, which is $0.23 less per gallon than the lock
price in 2016, resulting in an incremental savings of approximately $2.9 million
from 2016.
g. Gasoline is currently budgeted at an average cost of $2.65/gallon, which is $0.35
less per gallon than the price used in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget for an
incremental savings of approximately $0.7 million.
h. Certain items in the 2017 Requested Budget totaling around $4.0 million
materialized after the SBP was approved, including LRV major spare parts, and
various other smaller dollar items including CBA negotiation services and an
increase in off-duty police hourly rate. These items will be discussed and prioritized
with senior management and it will be determined if funds can be made available to
support these expenditures.
(8) Debt:
a. Budgeted principal payments of $58.9 million on a combined basis are $2.8 million
lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 141

2.C.1

b. Base System principal payments of $48.6 million are $3.3 million less than the
2016 Re-Amended Budget due to scheduled amortization of the Base System COPs
issued for fleet purchases.
c. FasTracks principal payments of $10.3 million are $0.5 million lower than the 2016
Re-Amended Budget due to refundings and scheduled principal amortization on
current debt.
d. No debt issuance is anticipated for either the Base System or FasTracks in 2017.
Both Base System and FasTracks will draw from previously issued debt to fund
major capital purchases and construction in 2017.
(9) Interest expense:
a. Interest expense is budgeted at $113.4 million, a decrease of $3.9 million from the
2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the effect of refundings and scheduled
amortization.
b. Of total interest expense, $28.3 million is budgeted for Base System and $85.1
million is budgeted on FasTracks.
c. Capitalized interest is budgeted at $32.9 million, no change from the 2016 ReAmended Budget. Capitalized interest is the interest expense associated with
construction projects that is capitalized as part of the asset value on the balance
sheet.
(10) Capital expenditures:
a. Base System new capital expenditures total $66.6 million. This is the amount
approved in the SBP for minimum “must-have” projects and is escalated at the CPI
of 3.0%.
b. FasTracks new capital expenditures are estimated at $235.6 million. This is a
preliminary amount subject to change in the Recommended Budget as estimates for
project expenditures in 2017 are reviewed and completed.
c. Capital carry forward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this time but
will be included in the Recommended Budget because it is based on the 9/30/16
close of RTD’s financial statements.
(11) Reserves:
a. The combined TABOR reserve is budgeted at $23.2 million.
b. The FasTracks contingency reserve is budgeted at $15.9 million at year-end. This
reserve was set at $30.0 million in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget and was reduced
by a Board-approved transfer to the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) project. In
2016, the SERE transfer will be replenished and the reserve will be drawn down by
$14.1 million for North Metro which was approved in the Annual Program
Evaluation.
c. The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million. The FasTracks
start-up operations reserve is reduced to $0 in 2017 from $25.0 million, eliminated
in order to meet debt service coverage.
(12) Fund balances:
a. Base System:
i. Increase of $7.0 million to Board-appropriated fund per the SBP for a total
fund balance of $17.4 million.
ii. Increase of $2.7 million to capital acquisition fund per the SBP for a total fund
balance of $2.7 million.
iii. A first-time contribution will be made to an unrestricted operating reserve in
the amount of $4.6 million.
iv. The unrestricted year-end fund balance is budgeted at $2.0 million, which is
the fund balance estimated in the SBP. The objective is to arrive at a

Packet Pg. 142

2.C.1

budgeted unrestricted fund balance as close as possible to that estimated in
the SBP, regardless of further expenditure adjustments and any revisions to
revenue.
v. Fund balances are increased in a manner consistent with Board policy and the
SBP. The total of the above fund balances is expected to be 5.8% of
projected Base System operating expenses, or $26.7 million by the end of
2017.
b. FasTracks:
i. The total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital acquisition fund, and the
unrestricted fund is $24.3 million and reflects 2 months of operating expenses
for both FasTracks Project/Construction and FasTracks Operations.
c. District-wide:
i. The total combined fund balances are expected to be 8.4% of projected
District-wide operating expenses by the end of 2017.
The preliminary 2017 Requested Budget and Fund Balance report which shows the operating and
capital sources and expenditures of the District for Base System and FasTracks is included as
Exhibit I.

Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Second Quarter of 2016. These year-to-date
measures provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its
passengers and the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 33
performance measures tracked for the GM, RTD met 25 of the goals in their entirety in the second
quarter. Of these, 3 are measured on an annual basis. The following is a discussion of the
exceptions.
Goal 1.1 – Safety Incidents
Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 miles
First Transit-Commerce City and First Transit-Longmont did not meet goal in Q2. There were a
total of twelve passenger accidents reported through Q2. Three of those accidents were
preventable. First Transit-Longmont had four passenger accidents with one preventable, and First
Transit-Commerce City had five passenger accidents with two preventable. Although Transdev
had one passenger accident and First Transit-Denver had two passenger accidents, neither carrier
exceeded goal.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for bus on-time service in Q2, but performance is
stable compared to Q1. In Local on-time service, First Transit-Denver and First Transit-Longmont
exceeded goal while the remaining carriers did not meet goal. Carriers RTD and Transdev
improved over Q1. Regional on-time performance did not meet goal but was stable to Q1.
Staff will continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst performing routes and identifying the
resources needed to improve, such as service changes and operator training.
Overall Light Rail service performance exceeded goal for both on-time service and service
availability.
Goal 4.2 – Level of Customer Complaints
Overall system complaints met goal, but individually, three carriers did not. Although they did not
meet goal, First Transit-Commerce City and First Transit-Denver improved in level of customer
complaints over 2015 while Transdev declined. Transdev, however, did improve over Q1,
reflecting improvements in staffing levels in Q2. All three carriers had a high number of

Packet Pg. 150

2.C.2

complaints related to missed service or late service (no show, bus late, discourtesy, passed up
passengers at stop). We also noted a decrease in ridership for all carriers (including RTD)
compared to each quarter in 2015. Transdev especially showed a large increase in “no show”
complaints, most likely due to the number of routes that were dropped or returned to RTD due to
lack of operator availability.
In Q2, the two carriers RTD and First Transit-Longmont exceeded goal. Staff provides an analysis
of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
Staffing challenges has caused fluctuations in on-time performance.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
The ridership goal is established with the 2016 Amended Budget. Although the goal was not met
in Q2 on a year-to-date basis, this measure is more properly assessed annually. We will monitor
and look forward to more data post-FasTracks roll-out in 2016.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
The fare revenue and operating revenue goals are established with the 2016 Amended Budget.
Although the goals were not met in Q2 on a year-to-date basis, these measures are more properly
assessed annually. We will monitor and look forward to more data post-FasTracks roll-out in
2016.

An accident is considered preventable any time the operator was not driving in full compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations and in such a manner as to avoid involvement despite adverse conditions of road, weather or
traffic or the errors of pedestrians or other drivers.
2
Bad weather in March resulted in a higher number of preventable accidents. Four of the total nine preventable accidents
that occurred in March happened when the roads were icy/snow-packed.
3
Of the total 12 passenger accidents reported through Q2, three were preventable. First Transit-Longmont had four
passenger accidents with one preventable, and First Transit-Commerce City had five passenger accidents with two
preventable. Transdev had one passenger accident and First Transit-Denver had two passenger accidents, but neither
carrier exceeded goal.

Three carriers did not meet goal and although First Transit-Commerce City and First Transit-Denver improved over
2015, Transdev worsened. Transdev showed a large increase in “no show” complaints, likely due to the number of
routes dropped or returned to RTD due to no operator available. Coupled with overall low ridership, TransDev achieved
a higher number of customer complaints per boardings. TransDev showed some improvement in Q2 reflecting
improvements in staffing levels.

The Smart Card Program continues to gather taps for EcoPass (business and neighborhood) and
CollegePass riders since the program’s launch on January 2, 2013. There are approximately 474,377
active cards in circulation. During the month of July, 2016, 1.07M taps were recorded, and in the
month of August 2016, 1.42M taps were recorded. The decrease in total taps for the month of July is
attributed to the College and University summer break.
The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and
used much like a gift card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar
amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card at RTD
sales outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the public pilot program
participants at the RTD retail outlets. As of September 1, 2016, a total of 1,910 cards were issued of
which 1,510 (79%) were full fare and 400 (21%) were discount cards. The average initial stored value
loading is $46.14 with a total value loaded including reloads of $251,000. There have been 84,750
boardings using these MyRide cards with fare payment value of $186,200. Of these boardings; 69%
were local, 28% regional and 2% airport.
All bus installations were completed for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as
buses purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line and B line to
Westminster. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge and the R line to
Aurora. All 191 Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
BUS and LIGHT RAIL TRAIN OPERATOR SAFETY
COLORADO STATE AUDITORS PERFORMANCE AUDIT
FOLLOW-UP of PREVIOUSLY AGREED UPON CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
AUDIT REPORT # 16-05-03

During 2015 the Colorado State Auditors contracted with Two Hills Accounting & Consulting, a
local Denver firm, to perform an audit at RTD covering ‘Bus and Light Rail Train Operator Safety’.
The final report was issued in September 2015.
Several recommendations and corresponding agreed upon corrective actions were included in
the report. Internal Audit recently completed follow-up testing to determine the status of those
actions, as all were to be implemented by the end of June 2016.
AUDIT SCOPE
We reviewed the current status of all six previously reported findings and performed appropriate
testing to validate if corrective actions have been implemented as agreed.

CONCLUSION
Internal Audit found that five of the agreed upon six corrective action items have been
implemented, with one item considered to be “Implemented and Ongoing.” Going forward,
management will ensure that the results of reviews to validate that appropriate drug and alcohol
testing, which is performed at contracted bus sites, is reported to the RTD Board on a quarterly
basis.
Internal Audit recommended in their Internal Report, that employees who perform compliance
reviews at contracted bus sites develop a standard approach to testing, documentation, and
reporting; thus ensuring a consistency amongst the staff.
CURRENT STATUS
We will review the status of these actions as part of our normal follow-up during the fourth quarter
of 2016.

FREE RIDE COUPONS AUDIT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT #16-02-01

The Management Directive on Complimentary Passes and Free Ride Coupon was revised on
4/1/10. The directive was established to set policy and provide procedures and guidelines for the
issuance of complimentary passes and free ride coupons. The directive categorized the request
for passes and listed the various users and the types of passes typically used. Free ride coupons,
special services coupons, and guest passes are parts of non-revenue generating product
offerings at RTD. The fixed-price contract for Security Printing of RTD Monthly Passes, Special
Passes, Ticket Books and Special Tickets was entered into in July 2015 with a contract not-toexceed amount of $1,310,541.00 for a period of three (3) years.
SCOPE
The Audit Scope was intended to be limited to the use and control of Free Ride Coupons however,
other complimentary passes were included on a limited basis as they are similar in nature.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit included but were not limited to:



Determine whether internal controls have been properly designed and implemented to
control distribution and use for the coupons
Review the strategy for setting limits on the number of coupons available and determining
the cost of program administration.
CONCLUSION

Complimentary pass programs are used by many Transit Agencies in the US. Audit obtained
information from eight (8) Transit Agencies that have complimentary pass programs however, the
Free Ride Coupons Program is not used continuously by any of them.
Free Ride Coupons have been used for the following purposes:





Introduction to new lines or introduction to public transit
Marketing and Promotion of RTD
Facilitating other Transit Agency dignitaries visiting the Metro area or attending
conferences
Customer relations issues.

Attachment: FAAC September 2016 with attachments (2896 : Quarterly Audit Update)

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

Audit agrees with the limited use of the Complimentary passes for the above purposes as they
relate to RTD business purposes.

Packet Pg. 180

2.C.5.a

Control of the program should be centralized to accommodate tracking and reconciliation and to
ensure the complimentary passes are only requested and distributed by a limited number of
individuals and used for RTD business purposes only.

Attachment: FAAC September 2016 with attachments (2896 : Quarterly Audit Update)

In line with the above recommendation the Complimentary Pass Policies and Procedures should
be updated to include more restrictive controls that facilitate central control, accountability and
reconciliation.
