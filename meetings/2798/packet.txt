BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Approval of ERP Licenses

CFO/AGM,

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to Workday for licenses for the ERP Replacement Program – Phase2 (Human Capital Management and
Payroll) for an amount not to exceed $2,700,000 over 5 years. RTD will be utilizing the City and
County of Denver’s contract with Workday. Subscriptions for the ERP Replacement Program – Phase 2
will be paid annually.
General Manager Goals:
 Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
 Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
 Task Goal #2 – Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
The current Oracle e-business suite (EBS) enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation at RTD is
approaching end of life. Oracle will end support for the EBS system in 2021.
Starting in 2017, the Information Technology team began researching various approaches for the ERP
replacement. Modern ERP solutions are moving toward a cloud-based, specialized solution. Three options
for replacement were presented to the AGM’s for consideration:
Upgrade the existing ERP Oracle system to Oracle Cloud.
1. Implement another vendor’s single cloud ERP solution (such as SAP or Workday)
2. Use a best-of-breed hybrid approach by implementing ERP cloud-based solutions for specific lines
of business (such as finance and human resources)
The options were presented to the AGM’s and they determined to use a best-of-breed, hybrid approach.
This enables RTD to take advantage of the strengths of various cloud-based solutions to improve
business operations and more closely align the cloud/software solution to business process. Cloud tools
make it easier to implement a best-of-breed approach and they also allow for integration between the
differing systems.
During the research phase, demonstrations of several vendor’s solutions were held with RTD business
units to determine the functionality needs and best fit for RTD business processes. Through this series
of demos and requirements gathering sessions, the determination was made that the human resources
and payroll modules will utilize Workday. The human resources and payroll related modules in the second
phase of the ERP replacement project include:

The current Oracle HCM and payroll modules are outdated and do not provide the functionality needed
by RTD. Oracle will end support for the current EBS system in 2021. Over the past eighteen months,
multiple vendors were invited to demo their solutions for these modules with RTD business units. The
Workday solution best fit the needs of the business units as well as the specific public-sector business
needs of RTD. Workday was also chosen because of the dependence and integration needed between
these modules and the finance backbone.
The Board previously approved a total of $15,000,000 for the complete ERP Replacement Program in
the 2018 - 2023 Strategic Budget Plan. The contract authority recommended in this board action will
use a portion of this approved funding for this second phase of ERP program licenses.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an RFI to obtain pricing for these modules with the National Association of State Budget
Officers (NASBO). NASBO has pre-negotiated contracts with the State of Colorado. The State bid and
awarded these contracts through their standard procurement processes and these contracts allow other
governmental agencies to utilize them. RTD also investigated using the City and County of Denver (CCD)
Workday contract to take advantage of the discounts provided to the City. CCDs contract is a
cooperative agreement and was competitively bid. Based on review of the two options, CCD’s contract
was more advantageous to RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $2,700,000. Funding for these licenses is included in the
approved ERP Replacement Program budget.
The yearly breakdown for the licenses is as follows:
2019
2020
2021
2022
2023

$684,640
$491,295
$491,295

$491,295

ALTERNATIVES

authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract to Workday for licenses for the ERP Replacement Program – Phase2 (Human Capital
Management and Payroll) for an amount not to exceed $2,700,000 over 5 years. RTD will be
utilizing the City and County of Denver’s contract with Workday. Subscriptions for the ERP
Replacement Program – Phase 2 will be paid annually.

Approval of Plan Changes to the Salaried
Employee's Pension Plan

CFO/AGM,

Date: December 4, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Amendment No. 3 regarding plan changes recommended by the Salaried
Employee Pension Trustees.
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability, and Task Goal #2 –
Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
It is the fiduciary responsibility of the Pension Trustees to continually review the plan provisions and
ensuring that they continue to meet the goals of the Pension plan. In August, Rael & Letson the pension
plan actuarial made several recommendations to the plan assumptions.
These recommendations include the following:


For benefits payable as a periodic annuity with an Annuity Start after January 1, 2019, the
adjustment factors for lump sum payments will be actuarially determined based on an interest
rate of 7% instead of the current rate of 7.5%.



Utilize the appropriate RP-2014 Mortality Table for healthy employees and annuitant without the
blue-collar adjustment to achieve the same actuarial impact on the Plan as the table with bluecollar adjustments effective January 1, 2019.
The mortality table was last updated in 2014 and the actuarial made recommendations regarding
some changes based on this pension plans specific experience. The Trustees reviewed the
various tables and determined that the table should be changed to the RP-2014 Mortality Table
for healthy employees and annuitants without blue-collar adjustment, to properly reflect the job
characteristics of the salaried employees in the Plan.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The actuarial recommended contribution prior to these changes would have been $7.95 million/year after
these recommendations the actuarial recommended contribution will be $8.68 million/ year. This is an
increase of $730,000/ year. For 2019, RTD is contributing $5.6 million.

1.B.3

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves the attached Amendment No. 3 regarding plan changes recommended by the
Salaried Employee Pension Trustees.

2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, this is not the preferred alternative
as this may have a negative impact on the funding of the pension plan.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter of 2018. These year-to-date measures provide
a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of
the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures tracked for the
GM, RTD met 33 of the goals in the first quarter. The following is a discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain System-Wide On-Time Performance
Regional on-time service at 87.0% did not meet goal of 92.0% but was improved over 2017 and only
slightly down from the second quarter.
Goal 4.2 – Reduce Level of Customer Complaints
Complaints per boardings on a system-wide basis were slightly above goal in the third quarter.
carriers except RTD and First Transit-Longmont exceeded goal.

All

Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
ADA OTP of 95.9% in quarter three was only slightly below goal of 96.0%. For 2019, the measure will
reflect passenger OTP at 86%, which is consistent with fixed route.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
Ridership for the third quarter of 2018 was down 2.0%. In 2017, ridership was down 1.9% for the
year. This mirrors the national trend. The goal for 2018 is an annual measure and the target is positive
ridership growth for the year. We will continue to monitor ridership.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Third quarter fare revenue and total operating revenue were up 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively, but are
currently short of the budgeted annual goals of 3.0% and 2.6%. The goal for 2018 is an annual
measure and we will continue to monitor this revenue.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Both bus operator vacancies and mechanic vacancies exceeded their goals at in the second quarter due
to attrition, retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local economy.

Subject:

Report on Status of Fare Implementation

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 4, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 11, 2018
Information

BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. Over the past 20 months, the Pass Working Group and RTD staff reviewed all fares and fare
programs to define potential fare changes and improvements, RTD staff presented a recommendation to
the RTD Board of Directors and received approval mid-September. The goal of this project is to
implement the changes to the RTD Fares, Fare Structure, changes and additions to the Fare Programs as
approved by the RTD Board of Directors.
2019 Approved Changes Summary:
 Cash Fare: $3 Local / $5.25 Regional / $10.50 Airport.
 3-Hour Pass: These fares allow riders to travel for three hours in any direction. This change replaces
the three-hour one-way transfer or ticket.
 Retain ticket book and MyRide discount with modifications (Riders purchasing a 10-ride ticket book
or paying with a MyRide smart card will receive a discount)
 The youth discount will increase from 50 percent to 70 percent and will be solely age-based (ages 619).
 Utilization pricing for pass programs: Pricing for EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass
will now be priced based upon trips taken.
 EcoPass: Other updates to pricing based on changes in service levels and employer categories.
 FlexPass: Discontinue program discount. Employers and employees pay regular monthly pass price.
 New Low-Income Program (Targeting July 2019)
DISCUSSION
The overall program is on target for delivery of scope due January 1. Below is a list of system and
business impacts that RTD IT is coordinating and the remaining activities to complete before January 1.
The project is currently in green status.

Low-Income Program Status
RTD has engaged the State OIT (Office of Information Technology) team to discuss scope of the
Low-Income program and potential options of how the State can support the Low-Income
program through the use of the State PEAK (Program Eligibility and Application Kit) System.
The overall goal is to have this PEAK system, which is already in production, handle as much of
the application process, support and maintenance as possible.
Activities in Progress:
 Conducted business and system requirements workshops
 Kicked off the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) process for defining the terms and
extent of the collaboration and the associated costs
 Drafted and reviewed the initial business requirements with the State OIT and targeting
to finalize by the end of December
 Initiated the State Order of Magnitude process which will give RTD an idea of the cost of
implementation, support and ongoing maintenance.
