July Board Meeting Agenda Review
Motion:

Director Catlin made the motion to move the
agenda for the July 30, 2024, Board Meeting to
the Full Board.
Director Guissinger seconded the motion.
Chair Davidson stated that because the majority
of July’s Committee Meetings happened in one
week, most of the action items, for Executive
Committee Agenda planning purposes, were
considered to be unanimous. There is one
change from Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s vote
outcomes. The September 2024 Service Change
will not be included in the Unanimous Consent
agenda and will be voted on separately in
Recommended Action. This will be reflected in
the Board Agenda for next week.
