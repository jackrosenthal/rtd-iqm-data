Motion:               Director Catlin made the motion to move the agenda for the July 30, 2024, Board Meeting to the Full Board.

Director Guissinger seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Davidson stated that because the majority of July’s Committee Meetings happened in one week, most of our action items, for Executive Committee Agenda planning purposes, were considered to be unanimous. There was one change from Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s vote outcomes. The September 2024 Service Change will not be included in the consent agenda and will be voted on separately. This will be reflected in the Board Agenda for next week.

Chair Davidson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.
