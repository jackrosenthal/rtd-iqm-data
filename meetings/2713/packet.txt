Screening Process and Criteria cont.
• Need:
“The Mall has failing and outdated infrastructure and limited
space for safe and engaging public gathering activities. The
deteriorating infrastructure causes safety hazards for both
pedestrians and vehicles, and requires frequent and costly
maintenance. The Mall attracts large numbers of people, but a
low percentage of people stop to spend time on the Mall. The
current configuration of the Mall creates a situation in which
pedestrian corridors are constrained, creating frequent
pedestrian and shuttle conflicts”

Recommendations

March

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service.
2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event.
BACKGROUND
1. RockiesRide - Major League Baseball expanded to include the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and
RockiesRide service began that same year. The service operated with 12 routes to 23 Park-n-Rides
and ran approximately 175 buses to all home games. Over the years, the service has been reviewed
and reduced to better match ridership. In 2017, the service was reduced to just two (2) routes
serving four (4) Park-n-Rides. Service operated on Opening Day, for Saturday and Sunday games,
and for fireworks games; most games operated with six (6) buses. In 2017, there were an average
of 472 boardings per game (approximately 236 RTD passengers).
Since the opening of Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies have allowed RockiesRide buses to use the
parking lot located on the corner of Wazee St. and 22nd Ave. (Rockies-Lot) to board and de-board
passengers. In November 2017, the Colorado Rockies notified RTD the Rockies-Lot would no longer
be available. Due to construction, the Colorado Rockies are required to relocate parking from another
location to the Rockies-Lot. RockiesRide is no longer able to use the parking lot as it has used for
the past 24 years.
It is recommended that RockiesRide service be discontinued due to low ridership and parking issues.
2. RACE - RTD began offering RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure
event on October 3, 1999. That year, the service operated with 20 buses from three (3)
Park-n-Rides. Race for the Cure attendance peaked at 65,350 in 2006. Peak boardings
for RACE Service occurred in 2005 (12,671 boardings) and has generally ranged between
8,000 and 12,000 from 2001 and 2011. In 2017, Race for the Cure attendance dipped
to 10,200 and RACE Service boardings dropped to an all-time low of 786 (approximately
393 RTD passengers). As Race for the Cure participation has declined, RTD boardings
have followed suit.
It is recommended that RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event be
discontinued due to low ridership and levels of event participation that do not meet RTD
service standards.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 19

1.C.2

1. RockiesRide - The Colorado Rockies offered to assist RTD in utilizing 21st St. between Blake and
Market to compensate for the loss of the Rockies-Lot parking. After looking at this location, bus
operations staff raised concerns as the location limits the number of buses that can be used.
Moreover, it constricts operations as driveways and alleys need to remain clear. This location will not
work for RTD.
Total boardings average 472 boardings per game (approximately 236 RTD
passengers).
Alternative service exists on the Routes 120X and LD/LX for customers on Weekdays and Saturdays.
No alternative service is available on Sundays.
2. RACE Service - The RTD service standard for event service requires 40,000 participants in one place
at one time. The 2017 Race for the Cure event participation (10,200) does not meet the RTD
service standard of 40,000 persons in one place at one time.
Alternative service exists on the Flat Iron Flyer for customers traveling from US36 & Table Mesa and
US-36 & McCaslin. No alternative service is available for passengers traveling from Wagon Road and
US-85 & Bridge.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. RockiesRide – Eliminating the service saves approximately $108,000 annualized.
2. RACE – Eliminating the service saves approximately $16,800 annualized.

PUBLIC HEARINGS
There are two public hearings proposed on February 5th, 2018, at the RTD Blake street office at 12:00

May 2018 Service Changes

Information

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. Included herein
is a restructure of service to the US36 & Broomfield Station (Routes 112, 120 and 128). A number of
bus stop consolidations are also proposed affecting Routes 6, 10,11, 12, 15, 16, 38 and 83, in effort to
improve on-time performance and the overall attractiveness of our service. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Hospital loop.
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Blvd.: discontinue select (4) trips
Route 62 – Commerce City/ Dick’s Sporting Good Park: reduce mid-day frequency to hourly, due to low
ridership.
Route 65 – Monaco Parkway: discontinue select (3) weekday trips due to low ridership.
Route 105 – Havana Street: reduce peak frequency south of Southmoor Station to DTC and limited stop
consolidation.
Route 121 – Peoria Street: discontinue 3:24am northbound trip.

our service. The aim of bus stop consolidation is to provide the appropriate spacing between bus stops,
thereby reducing travel time and increasing on-time performance.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue: bus stop consolidation.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue: afternoon peak trips to operate to/from Elitch’s only, not Colfax/Federal
and bus stop consolidation.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: bus stop consolidation.
Route 14 – West Florida Avenue: minor schedule adjustments.
Route 15 – East Colfax: run time analysis focused on late night service and bus stop consolidation.
Route 15L – East Colfax Limited: revise stops near the Anschutz Medical Campus for closer proximity to
the major facilities.
Route 16 – West Colfax Avenue/Route 16L – West Colfax Limited: bus stop consolidation.
Route 21 – Evans: bus stop consolidation.

related interline changes as result of a change to summer service levels: (204, 225,206/206F, 208/208F
and Y.
C, D, and L Lines: minor running time adjustments are proposed for the C, D, and L Lines on all service
days as a result of the changes from January that will require some refinement of timing. This will not
alter the trips and the same service will be provided. No cost impacts are anticipated.

listed in this proposal. Any subsequent changes necessary will be listed in the Final Service Change
Brochure prior to the implementation to be consistent with Board policy on public notification.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost savings of
approximately $659,000. Other anticipated impacts include a reduction in the number of operators
required to provide resulting levels of service (-3.5 FTE) and a reduction of 3 AM peak , 1 base and 2 PM
peak vehicles.
PUBLIC HEARINGS

from Wadsworth & Hampden (14 passengers per trip). And eliminating routes where
duplicate service exists, Route CB12 - US36 & Sheridan / US36 & Broomfield / US36 &
McCaslin (alternative Flat Iron Flyer). Cost savings estimated to be $30,830.
C, D, and L Lines
Minor running time adjustments are proposed for the C, D, and L Lines on all service days
as a result of the major change from January that will require some refinement of timing.
This will not alter the trips and the same service will be provided. No cost impacts are

Board Meeting Date: January 23, 2018

Subject:

2017 Securement Area Issues Data Analysis

As you are aware, RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Association (CCDC) entered into a joint
Settlement Agreement in March of 2014 in an effort to resolve issues related to availability of the
securement area on board RTD buses for passengers who use mobility aids. One of the requirements of
the Settlement Agreement was for RTD to adopt a policy to ensure individuals who use mobility aids,
including wheelchairs, have equal access to its buses and to the securement area. The key components
of this policy are as follows:






Large items cannot block the aisle of the bus
Large items must be collapsed prior to boarding, and non-disabled passengers must use the seats
behind the securement area for themselves and their items
If large items cannot be collapsed and stored behind the securement area, non-disabled
passengers will not be allowed to board the bus
Large items must be readily moveable and stowed behind the securement area
Passengers with mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, will be given priority boarding at bus stops

Starting with the effective date of the policy (March 22, 2014), RTD has been tracking 1) each incident
in which a bus operator reported passing up a passenger using a mobility aid and 2) each incident in
which a passenger complained that an operator had violated the policy. In accordance with one of the
reporting requirements of the Settlement Agreement, RTD is to present a report summarizing the data
noted above on an annual basis to the Board of Directors and to the CCDC. The report is also shared
with the Denver Regional Mobility Access Council (DRMAC) for posting on the DRMAC website and it is
also posted on the RTD website. This report provides a summary of the securement area issues data for
the period of January through December of 2017.
The data collected for this report is generated in three ways
1)
the operator presses a pre-programmed message button (“ADA PAX PASS-UP”) on the CAD/AVL
radio system
2)
the operator makes radio contact with RTD Dispatch using another button on the CAD/AVL radio
system
3)
a customer files a report with the RTD Customer Care Division.
Each incident generated by the above means is investigated and tracked. The investigation includes a
review of video from the bus (if available), a review of the audio file documenting the conversation
between the operator and the dispatcher, and a report from the operator which includes a copy of the
“ADA PAX PASS-UP” form given to the passenger. Based on the results of the investigation, each
securement area incident is assigned a code as follows:
DUP

Duplicate – this indicates that the operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button more
than once for the same incident

Packet Pg. 44

1.C.4

NPI

Not a Pass Up Incident – this indicates that one of the following occurred
 The passenger was accommodated on this bus
 The passenger boarded the following bus which was right behind this bus (no wait
time)
 The passenger left the area
 The operator pressed the button in error
 The operator was asking a question about the policy or procedure

LIFT

Lift Inoperable – this indicates that the lift or ramp on the bus was not functioning as
required

2 W/C

2 Wheelchairs – this indicates that 2 passengers in wheelchairs were already occupying
the securement area

W/C+OMA

Wheelchair and Other Mobility Aid – this indicates that one passenger in a wheelchair and
a passenger using another mobility aid are already occupying the securement area

2 OMA

2 Other Mobility Aids – this indicates that 2 passengers using other mobility aids are
already occupying the securement area

PXO

Passenger Overload – this indicates the bus was standing room only and no one was
willing or able to move to make room

OTHER

These incidents include things like two passengers in wheelchairs want to travel together
but there is already one passenger in a wheelchair in the securement area or the flip seat
will not flip up

CSR

Customer Service Report – this indicates a report of a violation of the Policy was reported
to Customer Care

PENDING

This indicates the investigation into the incident is still in process

NO DATA

This indicates there was insufficient data available to verify that a passenger in a
wheelchair or other mobility aid was passed up

For the period of January through December of 2017, the breakdown of incidents is as follows:
1068 Total incidents recorded
-22
Duplicate entries
-320 Not a “pass up” incident
69 passenger was accommodated after button had been pressed
6

Lift inoperable
Other – several of these incidents indicate 2 passengers in wheelchairs wanted to ride
together and there was already one passenger in a wheelchair or with a mobility aid on the
bus
Investigation pending
No data available

One additional statistic that was tracked was the number of times an operator pressed the lower priority
“Request To Talk” (RTT) button in order to contact Dispatch regarding a passenger pass up instead of
the high priority “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button. During the reporting period of 1/1/17 through 12/31/17,
operators used the RTT button 133 times. For all of these incidents the operators were contacted and
reminded to use the higher priority “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button when reporting pass-up incidents.
The 2017 data also showed a high number of operators pressing the ADA PAX PASS-UP button in error.
The investigation into these incidents many times showed confusion on the part of the operator. The
ADA PAX PASS-UP button is #12 on the CAD/AVL radio system. A fare dispute is button #14. A
securement area conflict (individual refusing to move from the securement area) is button #23.
Operators often pushed button #12 when needing to report some issue other than a pass up. In each
case, operators were instructed on the proper use of button #12.
All reports of inoperable lifts were forwarded to the maintenance departments at the respective divisions
for follow up. Documentation indicates that in most cases the passenger was either accommodated by
the follower or a trade bus.
The routes generating 20 or more pass-up incidents for the period of January through December, 2017,
were as follows:
Route 0 – 84 incidents (11.7% of total)
Route 10 – 31 incidents (4.3% of total)
Route 12 – 20 incidents (2.8% of total)
Route 15 – 97 incidents (13.5% of total)
Route 15L – 59 incidents (8.2% of total)

The total number of complaints received regarding a violation of the Settlement Agreement for the
period of January through December 2016 was 39.
The total number of complaints received regarding a violation of the Settlement Agreement Policy for the
period of January through December 2015 was 26.
For the period of March through December 2014 the number of complaints was 38.
The primary concerns raised in the complaints received regarding the Policy in 2017 were as follows:
 The securement area was already occupied by individuals with mobility devices.
 The bus passed the customer without providing the ADA PAX PASS-UP form.
 The operator failed to pull into the correct location to accommodate the passenger.
 The operator failed to take adequate steps to clear the securement area.

For the period of January through December 2017, RTD operators reported 720 pass-up incidents, an
average of 60 per month. Of the 720 pass-up incidents, 620 (86%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.
For the period of January through December 2016, RTD operators reported 652 pass-up incidents, an
average of 54 per month. Of the 652 pass-up incidents, 496 (76%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.
For the period of January through December 2015, RTD operators reported 858 pass-up incidents, an
average of 71.5 per month. Of the 858 pass-up incidents, 708 (83%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.
For the period of March through December 2014, RTD operators reported 605 pass-up incidents, an
average of 60.5 per month. Of the 605 pass-up incidents, 474 (78%) were due to the securement area
being full with passengers using mobility devices.
RTD and the private contractors provide ADA refresher training for all operators each year. This training
continues to reinforce RTD policies and procedures regarding accommodating passengers with
disabilities on RTD buses. It also attempts to raise operators’ awareness of the needs of passengers
with a variety of disabilities and mobility challenges.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 3rd
Quarter 2017

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the third quarter of 2017 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize bus
operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. The
contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings, through
periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. All of the passenger accidents that occurred through the 3rd
quarter were classified non-preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness
of passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger
accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 3rd quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
Transdev and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time Service with 88.4%
and 88.3% on-time performance in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Denver (87.7%) and First
Transit Commerce City (83.5%) did not meet the goal due in part to the high number of new
operators, unexpected detours, and traffic. RTD and the private contractors continue to
campaign routes and operators with low on time performance with a strong focus on first time
point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators
of low performing routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 88% on time
performance. Running time issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for
review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.

Packet Pg. 48

1.C.5



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 3rd quarter. The contractors continue to address this area
by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
3rd quarter 2017 ridership was not available at the time this report was prepared and as a result
Complaints per Boarding have not been calculated. The contractors did receive 880 less
complaints year to date through the 3rd quarter 2017 when compared to the same time period in
2016. The contractors continue to utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist
operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding ontime performance have helped address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue
to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors continue to take a variety of actions over and above contract requirements to
address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses, wage increases,
incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and mentoring programs.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 2017 3rd Quarter Report

Information

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 1.5% through the 3rd quarter of 2017 compared to the same period
of 2016. Productivity slightly decreased from 1.25 to 1.23 passengers per hour. During the same
period, Access-a-Cab ridership decreased by 14%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership
decreased by 1.6% compared to 2016.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride increased by 3.4% during the 3rd quarter of 2017
as compared to the same period of 2016. Access-a-Ride is approximately 6% under budgeted revenue
hours through the third quarter of 2017.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2017 was 96.37%; an increase when compared

Passenger on-time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2017 was 86.22%; an increase when
compared to the same period in 2016 (84.31).
On-time performance continues to improve resulting from an increase to operator wages which went into
effect, April 2017. The change to operator wages has contributed to improvements in our carrier’s
abilities to hire qualified staff.

Call-n-Ride technology changes: continued improvement with a new manifest being deployed within
the Call-n-Ride services. Deployed an ETA system for Call-n-Ride customers. Reduced reservation
time from 2 hours advanced notice to 1 hour.

Call-n-Rides.
In August, the City of Golden began paying for an additional 9 hours of service in the Golden Call-nRide. The Thornton Call-n-Ride began serving the new Adams County Human Services center that
opened in September 2017.

2017 3rd
Analysis

Quarter

Customer

Complaint

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 3rd Quarter of 2017. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2016.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2015 and 2016 remained at
.0004 complaints per passenger boarding. The 2017 goal was again set at .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding.
Ridership data for the 3rd Quarter of 2017 was only available as a total for RTD and the private
contractors combined. Consequently, the Complaints per Passenger Boarding per operating division
could not be calculated. The Complaints per Passenger Boarding for the District as a whole (local bus
operations) for the 3rd Quarter of 2017 was .0004. The Complaints per Passenger Boarding for the
same period in 2016 was also .0004.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

Packet Pg. 69

1.C.9

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station (and the alternate
boarding/deboarding locations during CCS construction) and Denver Union Station the first week
of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some refreshers on station
procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback
on ways to improve RTD service for passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2017, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 3rd Quarter 2017: the complaints in this category increased 9.7% compared to the
same period in 2016. The primary factor driving this increase is the current operator shortage. RTD and
the private contractors continue to focus on trying to reduce operator vacancies. RTD and the private
contractors continue to focus on timely pull-outs and providing service per published schedules. The
YTD average in this category for 2017 is 7.40 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016
was 6.74 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 11.1% compared to the same
period in 2016. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 70

1.C.9

YTD average in this category for 2017 is 4.59 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016
was 5.16 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 25.3% compared to the same
period in 2016. This category has been impacted by the operator shortages. However, occasional
improvements to staffing have resulted in periodic improvements in this category. Improving on-time
performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2017 is 8.05 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 10.78
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 10.1% compared
to the same period in 2016. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam,
Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety
campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is
3.78 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 4.21 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 27.6% compared to
the same period in 2016. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 7.74 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2016 was 10.69 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category increased 12.1% compared to the same
period in 2016. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 0.27 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2016 was 0.24 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 11.8% compared to the same
period in 2016. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment resulted in an increase in
complaints. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2017 is 1.15 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016
was 1.31 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 25.4%
compared to the same period in 2016. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

Packet Pg. 71

1.C.9

following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2017 is 6.49 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 8.71 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 35.1% compared to
the same period in 2016. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the
Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with upto-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in
the category for 2017 is 0.35 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2016 was 0.54
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 3rd Quarter 2017: complaints in this category decreased 13.4%
compared to the same period in 2016. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (137 of the total 2,885 = 4.75%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded
to the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2017 is 10.57 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2016 was 12.20 complaints per day.
Although the total number of complaints is lower than the previous year, it is important to note that
ridership is also lower (3rd Quarter 2017 = 38,541,545; 3rd Quarter 2016 = 43,945,183). Complaints
may be lower because fewer passengers are riding.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
Customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can continue to
improve the quality of service provided. Additionally, the results of the 2014 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(very poor) to 5 (excellent), RTD bus service received high ratings in the following operator-related
categories:
Courtesy of bus driver (4.4)
Driving skills (4.4)
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route (4.4)
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service (4.3)
Feeling of safety on bus (4.2)
Clarity of onboard stop announcements (4.2)

Fare Enforcement Statistics

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

Transit security officers are assigned to Light Rail and Commuter Rail to check for proper fare and to provide
security. The table below shows how many patrons were contacted for the quarter and the percentage of
patrons that did not present valid fare. There is also a designated transit security officer fare task force, whose
duties are to only ride light rail vehicles and concentrate on fare related issues throughout the service area.

Commander RTD Transit Police

Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors, dispatch
logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare
evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers.
Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is an
additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the authority to
check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the bus routes inspected
include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,

Subject:

Salaried Trustee Appointments

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: January 17, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: January 30, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Scott Reed and Derrick Black, to terms expiring
12/31/2020 as trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried
Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
BACKGROUND
On August 16, 2016, the Board approved amendments to the above Plans to provide for appointment of
the same four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being employee participants in
the Pension Plan, and two being employee participants in the Defined Contribution Plan, with termination
dates to provide for staggered terms. The terms of Scott Reed and Derrick Black expired on 12/31/17.
Resolution No. 27 Series of 2010, made modification to state that, “for reappointment of Trustees who
have served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is
not necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the
RTD Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or
appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts.”
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Scott Reed and Derrick Black, to terms expiring 12/31/2020 as
trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Plan.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require a revised
recommendation. This is not the recommended action.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Project Carryforward for SmartCard Stored
Value

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: January 17, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: January 30, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $1,919,147 from the operating reserve to the Information
Technology Base System capital project budget, effective January 1, 2018, to allow for the
completion of the SmartCard Stored Value Implementation Project (#10322) that was not completed
in 2017. The operating reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds that
were not spent on this project in 2017.
BACKGROUND
The 2018 Adopted Budget includes an amount for previously-approved projects carried forward from
2017. The basis to determine the amount to be carried forward is the Oracle accounting system.
The locally-funded SmartCard Stored Value Implementation Project was closed in error in Oracle,
therefore it was not included in the final capital carryforward report generated in Oracle. The project
was discovered in an Oracle post-budget capital carry-forward report in which the project had been
reopened.
DISCUSSION
The balance of the funds for this project totaling $1,919,147 were not accrued or spent at the end
of 2017. The transfer from the operating reserve to fund the carry-forward to 2018 will allow the
project to proceed in 2018. This transfer will allow RTD to continue work on this SmartCard
project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no net financial impact to RTD. The unspent funds for this project were included in the
general fund balance at year-end. The savings to RTD from not completing the project in 2017 will
be carried forward and be used to replenish the operating reserve at the time of the 2018 Amended
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $1,919,147 from the
operating reserve to the Information Technology capital project budget, effective January 1,
2018, to allow for completion of the SmartCard Stored Value Implementati on Project that was
not completed in 2017. The operating reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended
Budget with funds that were not spent on this project in 2017.

Packet Pg. 83

2.B.2

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at this time.
Instead, include this request as part of the 2018 Amended Budget. This action is not recommended
since it will require RTD to suspend work on this project, and will not allow RTD to advance the
ongoing SmartCard project as a whole.

RTD Code of Ethics

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: January 23, 2018
Information

No action required; for information only at the January 23 Finance Administration & Audit Committee. A
Recommended Action regarding the following may be taken to the following Finance Administration &
Audit Committee in February.
BACKGROUND
The current RTD Code of Ethics (Code) was approved by the Board of Directors January 21, 2003.
RTD’s Code is consistent with FTA requirements that the District have a Board-approved code of ethics
applicable to the Board as well as to RTD employees with responsibility for procurement. However, while
such a “procurement code of ethics” provides guidance for specific employees and protection for RTD in
situations related to contractual relationships, it fails to guide RTD Directors and Staff on broader, more
basic ethical standards by which all RTD representatives should be measured. RTD’s current Code has
long caused confusion because while it is given to all RTD employees, only a small subset of RTD
employees are actually subject to its terms. The current Code also needs updating to adhere to current
legal requirements. Staff is tonight presenting a draft of a new Code, and is seeking comments,
questions and suggestions before presenting a final draft and recommended action to this Committee in
January.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 85

2.C.1

RTD decided that updating the RTD Code of Ethics was a valuable project that could successfully be
assigned to the 2017 Leadership Academy. The project was taken on by a team of RTD represented and
salaried employees: Todd Kier, Corey Petzinger, Karl Shoemaker and Raleigh Elstun. The team has been
sponsored and mentored by RTD’s General Counsel Department and Education, Training & Development
Division.
The proposed new RTD Code of Ethics started as a clean sheet. The cohesive team collaborated, set
goals, planned the work, and then worked their plan. The team identified current FTA requirements and
researched other transit agency Codes of Ethics (Sound Transit, MBTA, BC Transit, SEPTA) for ideas
and guidance.
The team and General Counsel ultimately decided to have a two-part Code of Ethics: the main part
which pertains to all employees, and a smaller part with additional standards which pertain to employees
with fiduciary responsibilities. This arrangement was determined to be optimal for clarity, simplicity,
functionality, and applicability for all employees.
Unlike the current Code, the proposed Code of Ethics is much shorter, far less technical in language, and
goes beyond procurement to express basic ethical standards applicable to all RTD representatives:
Integrity, Honesty, Inclusivity, Transparency, and Sustainability.
Instead of the current document in which examples and explanatory comments are part of the Boardapproved Code and can therefore only be updated or revised through Board action, the proposed Code
offloads examples and comments into a separate procedure which will be maintained and updated as
necessary by RTD’s General Counsel. This keeps the Board-approved Code of Ethics clean and simple,
and allows for regular updating of examples as necessary to ensure that they stay relevant and address
current concerns and questions.
The proposed Code includes changes addressing changes in law since 2003, and applies monetary
standards for gifts based on those now applicable to other public employees under the Colorado
Constitution (through the ballot initiative Amendment 41).
The Leadership Academy team gave presentations and conducted interviews with many RTD
stakeholders including Safety, Security, Legal, Civil Rights, Human Resources, Labor Relations, Asset
Management, and RTD’s General Manager. Drafts were also provided to the Union for review and
comment. This outreach provided invaluable information and perspectives to aid the team to create the
most relevant and highest quality Code of Ethics possible. The draft Code of Ethics presented tonight is
an original document that satisfies legal requirements as well as major stakeholders’ wishes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no adverse financial impact to adopting the new Code of Ethics. There will be mino r costs in
printing and distributing the new Code and obtaining approvals. RTD already conducts training
courses in ethics to new and other employees. RTD will educate employees on the Code of Ethics
and is planning to roll out training and education within RTD’s existing education and training
budget.

Leadership Academy Code of Ethics Project
Todd Kier - Cory Petzinger - Karl Shoemaker - Raleigh Elstun
Sponsors: Rolf Asphaug and Pam Kachka

Introduction: The current RTD Code of Ethics (COE) is self-limited in applicability to employees who interact
with contractors or whose roles include contract assignments and reviews. While this provides a level of
guidance for specific employees and a level of protection for RTD in situations related to contractual
relationships, there is no standard by which all employees conduct is guided.
Objectives:





Work closely with RTD legal counsel to develop a comprehensive Code of Conduct/Ethics that is
applicable to all RTD employees
Develop a rollout plan for 2018
Work with the Employee Onboarding & Orientation project team to incorporate the Code of
Conduct/Ethics
Cooperate with ETD to develop the necessary training for new and existing employees

Background:




Previous Code of Ethics was written in 2003 and needs updating to adhere to current FTA requirements
Applied only to a limited number of employees
Need up-to-date data and relevant examples

Process:







Research other Codes of Ethics (Sound Transit, MBTA, BC Transit, SEPTA) for ideas and guidance
Get input from RTD Stakeholders (Safety/Security, Legal, Civil Rights, Human Resources, Labor
Relations, Asset Management, CEO)
Create an original document that satisfies FTA requirements, major stakeholders’ requirements,
followed by an abridged version of the document in order to be simple and concise in delivering the
message of the new Code of Ethics that encompasses all members of RTD.
Present to Board of Directors for review and approval
Consult with Union counsel in order to get “buy in”, and avoid any pitfalls

Recommendations:



Company-wide adoption of the new Code of Ethics, now applicable to all employees



The creation of a new internal Ethics course complete interactive webinars made possible by ETD’s new
Franklin Covey software package.



The marketing department can create a campaign to introduce the new Code of Ethics, explaining why
it is valuable to our corporate culture, and to invite employees to participate in the upcoming training
course.

Packet Pg. 89

2.C.1.b

A.

Introduction

All of us at RTD are expected to be ethical role models. We must all be alert to potential
ethical issues and be ready to respond appropriately. Those of us who supervise others must
foster an atmosphere that encourages everyone to seek help if faced with ethical dilemmas.
Responsibility for compliance with standards for ethical conduct ultimately rests with each one
of us.
A key goal of this Code is to promote integrity by preventing conflicts of interest.
Conflicts between our RTD roles and our private interests, whether real or perceived, must be
avoided.
This Code also supports an environment at RTD of honesty, trust, inclusivity and
sustainability: a just culture with sincere, respectful and open communications.
This Code contains five main parts. The first part identifies five basic ethics standards
that apply to all of us at RTD. The second part contains rules limiting RTD contracts with
current and former RTD employees who have responsibility for or influence upon procurement
decisions, including all RTD managers and directors. The third part concerns annual disclosures
by those with responsibility for procurement decisions. The fourth part explains how to get
advice about the Code and states how RTD enforces the Code, including penalties for violation.
The fifth part provides more resources to help interpret the Code, including citations to relevant
legal standards.
The rules in this Code are simple, reasonable, and grounded in common
sense. This Code clearly states expectations for all RTD employees. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of this Code will not be accepted.
No code of ethics can anticipate every possible situation, and this Code of Ethics does
not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply. We must be familiar and
comply with all laws, standards and rules related to our specific jobs. To help in applying the
rules in this Code, RTD’s General Counsel will issue comments and examples applying the Code
to situations that may come up. These comments and examples will be approved by the Senior
Leadership Team as official RTD policies and procedures. In addition, RTD provides ethics
training and resources to apply this Code to situations you are likely to encounter. If you are
ever unsure whether anything you do may violate this Code, contact RTD’s General Counsel for
a written advisory opinion before you take action.
This 2018 revision of RTD’s Code of Ethics was led by an RTD Leadership Academy team
consisting of represented and salaried employees. After internal reviews and solicitation of

Directors on _______________, 2018.

Five Basic Ethics Standards for All of Us at RTD

This part of the Code contains five basic ethics standards that apply to each of us: all
RTD employees regardless of position, plus RTD directors (also referred to as “employees” in
this part). These standards are: integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability.

1. Integrity
We will avoid conflicts of interest and promote public confidence in the
integrity of RTD’s decisions.
1.1. We will not engage in outside business or activities that interfere with official
RTD duties and responsibilities, or in official RTD duties and responsibilities that
directly affect an employee’s outside business or activities.
1.2. We will not use our positions for personal gain or private benefit, whether for
ourselves or for our families, acquaintances, or businesses.
1.3. We will not offer, or give in response to solicitation, any item of monetary value
to anyone from whom we are seeking official action.
1.4. No director, officer, employee, or agent of RTD will be interested in any contract
or transaction with RTD except in his or her official representative capacity.
1.5. RTD’s officers, employees, agents, or board members will neither solicit nor
accept gifts, gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors,
potential contractors, or parties to subcontracts unless the financial interest is
not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. For
purposes of determining whether monetary value is “not substantial” or of
“nominal intrinsic value,” RTD applies the current dollar limits in Colorado
Constitution Art. XXIX (Amendment 41). To confirm the current dollar limit, click
here for RTD’s ethics procedures or contact RTD‘s General Counsel.

award or administration of contracts, RTD is generally prohibited from entering into contracts
with such employees, or with such former employees within one year of termination of
employment.

1. Contracts with Current Employees
RTD will not enter into any transaction involving goods, services or
property with an RTD employee, or with a person or entity in which an
RTD employee has an interest.
RTD employees are considered to have an interest in transactions involving:
1. Any immediate family member (spouse or domestic partner, and their
parents, children, brothers and sisters)
2. Any person or entity with whom an RTD employee has an agreement to
receive (or reasonable expectation of receiving) any benefit

Directors at its next regular meeting.
5. Contracts entered into with full disclosure and knowledge of the conflict, and

Advice, Enforcement, and Penalties for Violation

If you are unsure as to whether an action may violate this Code of Ethics, you should
first consult the comments and examples in RTD’s official policies and procedures, and then

anything you do may violate this Code, contact the General Counsel for a written advisory
opinion before taking action.

and including termination of employment, or such action or penalties as authorized by RTD’s
Bylaws, respectively, in addition to any other penalties authorized by law.
A contractor’s or agent’s contract with RTD may include terms incorporating all or part
of this Code of Ethics and treating contractor employees as RTD employees for such purposes.
Violation of this Code may be considered a breach of the contract with RTD or grounds for
disbarment from future RTD contracts.

Construction and Authority

The RTD Board of Directors has approved this Code of Ethics. This Code replaces all
prior Codes, but does not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply.
This Code of Ethics is to be construed liberally to promote its purposes and to
supplement such other rules, regulations and laws as may apply.
This Code of Ethics is prospective, not retroactive, in application. The provisions of this
Code are severable; i.e., if any of its provisions are deemed unconstitutional or invalid, that will
not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions.
This Code of Ethics is based on and supplements provisions in the Regional
Transportation District Act and RTD's Bylaws, as amended, to which RTD directors and
employees are also subject.

Section 1. Refrain from Participation. Any member of the Board who is
present at a meeting at which is discussed any matter in which he has,
directly or indirectly, a private pecuniary or property interest, shall
declare that he has a conflict and shall refrain from advocating for or
against the matter, and shall not vote in respect to such matter.
Section 2. Official Interest Only.

as RTD rules the following requirements for federal grantees in FTA Circular 4220.1F (March 18,
2013), Ch. 3, as amended:
1. WRITTEN STANDARDS OF CONDUCT. The Common Grant Rules require each
recipient to maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its

Introduction

At the same time, qualified persons should be encouraged to serve as RTD directors
and employees. RTD directors and employees should be permitted to pursue their own
private interests except where a conflict of interest would result.
The rules in this Code are intended to be simple and reasonable. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of the standards in this Code will not be accepted. Any RTD
director or employee unsure of what is expected should also review the comments
following each rule. If after reviewing the Code, including its comments and examples, any
person remains in any way uncertain whether an action will violate this Code, the person
should request an advisory opinion from the General Counsel before taking the action.

Attachment: Code of Ethics - Existing (3362 : RTD Code of Ethics)

This Code of Ethics establishes mandatory ethical standards for directors and
employees of the Regional Transportation District. To merit the trust of the public we
serve, RTD directors and employees must not be motivated by personal or private gain in
performing official duties, and must conduct themselves to avoid any appearance of such
motives. In addition, federal procurement regulations require RTD to maintain a written
code of standards of conduct governing the performance of directors and employees
engaged in the award and administration of contracts.1

Emergency situation means a situation that, to the satisfaction of the General Counsel,
requires immediate execution of a contract between RTD and an RTD employee (or
1 49 C.F.R. §§ 18.36(b)(3), 18.36(c)(v) (USDOT Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants

and Cooperative Agreements to State & Local Governments – “Common Grant Rule”); FTA Circular
4220.1D (Apr. 15, 1996) §§ 7(c), 8(a); FTA Master Agreement (Oct. 1, 1995) § 3(a); FTA Best
Practices Manual § 2.1.3. Section 7(c) of FTA Circular 4220.1D adds board directors as persons to
whom the standards must apply.

the District in accordance with the above standards.
Employment means any rendering of services on request, whether paid or unpaid.
Immediate family means an employee’s spouse or domestic partner, and their parents,
children, brothers and sisters.
Interest means any direct or indirect pecuniary or material benefit held by or accruing to an
employee arising from a transaction involving official action by the District. Unless
otherwise provided, the term "interest" does not include any remote interest. An
RTD employee is deemed to have an "interest" in transactions involving:
1.

Any person in the employee's immediate family;

The RTD Act and RTD By-Laws

This Code is based on provisions in the state Regional Transportation District Act
and RTD's own Bylaws to which RTD directors and employees are subject.
The Regional Transportation District Act states:
32-9-118. Conflicts of interest prohibited. No director, officer, employee,
or agent of the District shall be interested in any contract or transaction with
the District except in his official representative capacity.
RTD's Bylaws state, at Article X:

Attachment: Code of Ethics - Existing (3362 : RTD Code of Ethics)

Property means any real or personal property, whether tangible or intangible, and includes
currency and commercial paper.

Section 1. Refrain from Participation. Any member of the Board who is
present at a meeting at which is discussed any matter in which he has,
directly or indirectly, a private pecuniary or property interest, shall declare
that he has a conflict and shall refrain from advocating for or against the
matter, and shall not vote in respect to such matter.

Section 2. Official Interest Only.

(b) Neither the holding of any office or employment in the
government of any municipality or other public body or the federal
government, nor the owning of any property within the State of
Colorado shall be deemed a disqualification for membership on the
Board of Directors or employment by the District, nor a
disqualification for compensation for services as a member of the
Board of Directors, or as an employee or agent of the District.

Impartiality

RTD employees must avoid giving the impression that any person can improperly
influence them in their performance of official acts.
Comment:
This section prohibits employees from taking any action, whether in
an official or private capacity, which may cause the public to suspect favoritism by the
District. This section should be read together with the provisions of section 11 of this
Code on disqualification.
Examples:
1.

An RTD employee writes a letter to the editor of a local newspaper
criticizing the District for failing to hire a contractor with whom the
employee has had substantial private business dealings. The employee’s
actions violate this section.

2.

While participating in the selection process for a firm to contract with the
District, an RTD employee allows representatives of a potential contractor to
pay for the employee’s travel expenses and/or lodging. The employee’s
actions violate this section.

3.

An RTD employee is elected to the local city council. The employee may
hold office without violating this section; however, the employee should
declare that she has a conflict and refrain from advocating or participating in
contracts or agreements concerning the District.

Attachment: Code of Ethics - Existing (3362 : RTD Code of Ethics)

(a) No member of the Board of Directors, nor any employee or agent
of the District, shall be interested in any contract or transaction with
the District except in his official representative capacity, or as
provided in his contract of employment with the District.

Gifts, Entertainment and Favors

1.

To do so may give the appearance that the employee will be influenced in
the discharge of official duties;

2.

The employee recently has been, is now, or in the near future may be
involved in any official act directly affecting the donor or lender; or

3.

The employee has or appears to have influence over actions of the District
affecting the donor or lender.

This section does not apply to infrequent, non-pecuniary gifts of insignificant value
such as inexpensive food or refreshments in the ordinary course of a business meeting, or
such as unsolicited advertising material such as pens, pencils, calendars or other businessrelated items.
This section also does not apply to items, even if of significant value, when the
circumstances should make it clear that an obvious, long-standing social or family
relationship rather than the business of the persons concerned is the motivating factor, or
when the item is an award publicly presented in recognition of public service, or to random
drawings open to and participated in by the public.
An employee may also receive voluntary gifts of nominal value on a special
occasion such as a birthday, marriage, birth, religious holiday, illness, retirement or
transfer.
Comment:
The purpose of this section is to prohibit the solicitation or
acceptance of any gift, whether in the form of money, services, loans, travel,
entertainment, hospitality or promises, under circumstances in which it reasonably could
be inferred that the gift was intended to influence the recipient, or could be expected to
influence the recipient, in the performance of official duties.
Examples:
1.

An RTD employee asks the president of a company seeking a contract with
the District to find employment for the employee’s nephew in the company.
The employee’s request violates this section.

2.

An RTD employee enters his name in a special sweepstakes drawing
sponsored by a company that from time to time has business dealings with
the District. The drawing is not open to and participated in by the general
public. The employee’s name is drawn as the winner of an all-expense paid

3.

An RTD employee owns a construction company. An officer of a
construction firm seeking a contract with the District promises to buy the
necessary materials for the contract from the employee’s company if the
officer’s firm wins the RTD contract. In reliance upon the officer’s promise,
the RTD employee tries to have the contract awarded to the officer’s firm.
The employee’s actions violate this section.

4.

In the course of a business meeting outside RTD’s offices, an RTD employee
accepts coffee and sandwiches offered by representatives of a company
hoping to bid upon matters for which the employee has responsibility. The
employee’s actions do not violate this section provided the value of the food
is insignificant.

Contracts Involving Employees

The District shall not enter into any contract involving goods, services or property
with an RTD employee or with a business or organization in which an RTD employee has
an interest (as defined in section 2 of this Code). This section shall not apply in the case
of:
1.

Contracts with a business that is the only available source for essential
goods, services or property;

2.

The designation of a bank or trust company as a depository for District
funds, or the borrowing of funds from any bank or lending institution that
offers the lowest available rate of interest for such loan;

3.

Contracts entered into with a business that employs a District consultant,
provided that such employment is not incompatible with the consultant’s
duties to the District;

4.

Contracts under emergency circumstances, provided that a record explaining
the emergency is prepared by the General Manager and submitted to the
Board of Directors at its next regular meeting and thereafter kept on file;

5.

Contracts entered into with full disclosure and knowledge of the conflict,
and approval of the contract, by the Board of Directors; or

6.

Contracts where the employee’s interest in the contract is a remote interest
(as defined in section 2 of this Code) and is fully disclosed.

this section.

7

Packet Pg. 106

2.C.1.c

Comment:
This section merely reiterates the general prohibition against public
entities contracting with employees. Such contracts may give the appearance of selfdealing. While the District is responsible for avoiding such contracts, it is equally improper
for employees knowingly to enter into such a contract.
To come within this section, the contract need not be directly between RTD and an
employee, but may also be between RTD and a business in which an employee has an
interest. Such interest need not be financial in nature; for example, a family relationship
may be sufficient to establish a prohibited interest.

1.

An RTD employee is also an officer of a public utility company that provides
the only available service of its kind. Although the District is not prohibited
from contracting for such services with the employee’s company, the
employee should disqualify herself from participating in any discussion or
decision concerning the contract or the services provided to RTD.

2.

An RTD employee is also an officer of a bank that offers the same rate of
interest for loans sought by RTD as do other lending institutions within the
District’s boundaries. The District should not seek to borrow funds from the
employee’s bank. However, if the employee’s bank offers the lowest rate of
interest, the District may borrow funds from the bank provided that the
employee discloses his interest and disqualifies himself from participating in
any manner in the transaction.

3.

An RTD employee approves a contract with a construction firm that,
pursuant to a prior agreement, subsequently assigns at a discount the
proceeds of the contract to a firm in which the employee is a partner. The
employee’s approval of the contract violates this section even if the
employee sells her partnership interest before the actual assignment of the
proceeds.

4.

An RTD employee owns a few shares -- less than five percent -- of a
publicly-traded company with which the District contracts for goods. The
employee’s actions do not violate this section because the employee’s
interest in the company is a “remote interest” as defined in section 2 of the
Code.

Confidential Information

No employee shall disclose, use, or allow others to use for private interests
confidential information acquired by virtue of the employee’s position or employment with
the District.

Even if not intended for financial gain, the unauthorized or premature release of
confidential information to a relative, friend or business associate tends to undermine
public confidence in the District and is therefore prohibited.
Examples:

8.

1.

An RTD employee buys land knowing, but without disclosing, that RTD is
planning a new transit line that will substantially increase the land’s value.
The employee’s actions violate this section.

2.

An RTD employee invests, or advises a friend to invest, in securities of a
company about to be awarded a highly profitable contract with the District.
The employee’s investment or advice violates this section.

Representation

No employee shall represent, advise or appear on behalf of any person or firm
concerning any contract or transaction which is or may be the subject of an official act or
action of the District. No employee shall use or attempt to use the employee’s official
position to secure unwarranted privileges or exemptions for the employee or other
persons.
Comment:
This section is intended to prevent both the actual practice and public
appearance of “influence-peddling.” The prohibition extends to appeals made on behalf of
an undisclosed person.

9.

Attachment: Code of Ethics - Existing (3362 : RTD Code of Ethics)

Comment:
An RTD employee must not use for the employee’s or others’
financial gain “inside” information not generally available to the public and to which the
employee has access solely because of the employee’s association with the District.

Incompatible Employment or Services

No employee shall engage in, accept employment with, or render services for any
private business or professional activity when such would be adverse to or incompatible
with the proper discharge of the employee’s official duties.
RTD Code of Ethics (1/21/2003 rev.)

9

Packet Pg. 108

2.C.1.c

Comment:
This section is intended to ensure that District employees do not
accept other employment that may impair the employees’ abilities to exercise independent,
objective judgment in their official roles. Other employment may be incompatible with
employment at RTD either due to physical inability to perform the functions of both jobs or
due the duties and functions of the two jobs being inherently inconsistent.
Example:
An RTD employee is charged with supervision and approval of work on
District property performed by an outside contractor. The employee accepts
a second job with the company that performs such work. The employee’s
dual employment is incompatible and violates this section.

10. Disclosure
An employee who has an interest that the employee has reason to believe may be
affected by the employee’s official acts, or by the official acts of the District, shall fully
disclose such interest to the General Counsel for a determination as to whether such
interest violates this Code.
An employee with any interest, direct or indirect, in any contract to which the
District is or is about to become a party, or in any other business with the District, shall
fully disclose such interest to the General Counsel for a determination as to whether such
interest violates this Code.
Employees with responsibility for District procurements shall complete and submit
to the General Counsel a yearly interest disclosure form. The information required by the
disclosure form is intended only to disclose the nature of relationships that an employee
may have that could result in a conflict of interest, and therefore no financial data is
required. The information is intended to disclose investments in businesses that engage in
activities related to the business of RTD, such as: transit equipment suppliers, companies
engaged in manufacturing rail transit rolling stock and related components, and
construction companies engaged in transit systems, etc. The General Counsel will use the
disclosure forms to prepare a general, non-personalized list of those persons or entities
with whom the District should not do business. The General Counsel will provide the list to
the Manager of Materials Management. Should the Manager of Materials Management
question whether it is proper for RTD to do business with a person or entity appearing on
the list, the Manager will request the General Counsel for a determination as to whether a
conflict of interest exists.

Packet Pg. 109

2.C.1.c

The increasingly complex nature and scope of the activities of the District means
that inadvertent conflicts may arise, causing public embarrassment or scrutiny of both the
employee involved and the organization. To prevent the possibility of an inadvertent
conflict of interest and to provide as much protection as possible to employees and the
District from being placed in such a position, this Code requires yearly disclosure of
interests in certain categories of businesses by employees with responsibility for
procurements.
Examples:
1.

An employee is a creditor of an insolvent company being considered for
construction work by the District. The employee should disclose her interest
to the General Counsel.

2.

An employee is uncertain whether his relationship with a company being
considered for work by the District warrants disclosure. The employee
should disclose his relationship to the General Counsel for an advisory
opinion.

3.

An employee has responsibility for approval of certain District contracts. The
employee should fill out and submit a yearly disclosure form.

11. Disqualification
An employee is disqualified from participating in any official act directly affecting a
business or activity in which the employee has any interest or remote interest.
Comment:

Attachment: Code of Ethics - Existing (3362 : RTD Code of Ethics)

official acts on behalf of the District. The burden of making such disclosures rests on the
individual employees. The District’s employees are held to a high standard of care and
good faith to ensure that no potential interest goes undisclosed. Any concerned individual
should, on his or her own initiative, request the General Counsel for an advisory opinion as
to whether a particular personal or financial relationship warrants disclosure under this
section.

This section is intended to prevent conflicts of interest from arising after the
District has awarded a contract to a business in which an employee has an interest. For
example, while this Code permits transactions involving businesses in which District
employees have remote interests, this section prohibits employees with even remote
interests from participating in official acts affecting such businesses.

RTD Code of Ethics (1/21/2003 rev.)

Packet Pg. 110

2.C.1.c

1.

An employee holds less than five percent of the shares of a business with
which the District does business. The employee should not participate in any
official act directly affecting the business.

2.

An employee is a director of a nonprofit organization with which the District
has a contract. The employee should not participate in any official act
directly affecting the organization.

3.

An employee is seeking employment with a business that is bidding on a
District contract. Since a person is deemed to have an interest in
transactions involving a prospective employer, the employee should not
participate in any official act directly affecting the business.

12. Acquiring an Interest
No employee shall acquire an interest in any contract or transaction when such an
interest may be affected, directly or indirectly, by the employee’s or the District’s official
acts.
Comment:
This section prevents employees from making investments or otherwise acquiring
interests that create or may give the appearance of creating a conflict with their official
duties or the District’s official acts. If an employee acquires an interest in good faith and
without reason to believe that a conflict or the appearance of a conflict is created, the
employee is not required to divest herself of the interest; however, as required elsewhere
in this Code, the employee should fully disclose the nature and extent of the interest when
she discovers the conflict or appearance of a conflict, and should refrain from participating
in any official acts affecting her interest.
This Code does not prohibit employees from retaining an otherwise prohibited
interest acquired prior to the interest holder’s election, appointment, or employment with
the District, provided that the existence of such interest is properly disclosed. However,
this section prohibits renewal or expansion of such an interest.

Examples:

Examples:
1.

An employee acquires stock in a company from which the District has
recently made a cash purchase of equipment. Because the purchase is a
completed transaction and unlikely to be affected by the official acts of
either the employee or the District, the employee’s stock ownership does
not violate of this section.

RTD Code of Ethics (1/21/2003 rev.)

12

Packet Pg. 111

2.C.1.c

2.

An employee who supervises and approves certain construction work by a
contractor acquires an interest in a company to which some of the work is
later subcontracted. If the employee had no reason to foresee that a conflict
might arise, his interest in the subcontractor does not violate this section;
however, the employee should disclose his interest and disqualify himself
from the work of both the principal contractor and the subcontractor.

The District shall not contract with, or take any official act favorably affecting, any
person, or any business represented by a person, who has within the preceding twelve
month period been an employee of the District.
Comment:
This section is intended to prevent employees from improperly using knowledge and
influence acquired through employment with the District in subsequent post-employment
dealings with the District. It is also intended to prevent the consideration of future
employment from improperly influencing a District employee.
The following factors should be considered in determining whether a proposed
action is prohibited by this section:
1.

The employee’s position and duties with the District;

2.

The identity of the new or prospective employer;

3.

The employee’s position and duties with the new or prospective employer;

4.

The nature of the relationship between the new or prospective employer and
the District; and

5.

The nature and extent of the employee’s contact with the new or
prospective employer while employed by the District.

Attachment: Code of Ethics - Existing (3362 : RTD Code of Ethics)

13. Contracts Involving Former Employees

A person or business may be considered to be “represented by” a former District
employee based on the following factors:
1.

Whether the employee meets or would meet in the new or prospective
employment the definition of an “employee” under this Code;

2.

The nature and extent of the knowledge and influence acquired by the
employee from employment with the District;

RTD Code of Ethics (1/21/2003 rev.)

13

Packet Pg. 112

2.C.1.c

3.

Whether in the new or prospective employment the employee has or will
have the power to negotiate or influence agreements or otherwise bind the
new or prospective employer;

4.

Whether in the new or prospective employment, the employee has or will
have duties (1) that allow the use of knowledge or influence acquired from
employment with the District; or (2) that include direct or indirect dealings
with the District.

1.

An employee resigns from his position at the District, accepts employment in
a company, and participates in negotiating a contract between the company
and the District. The District should discontinue negotiations with the
company.

2.

An employee is terminated by the District as part of a reduction in force, and
seeks employment with an affiliate of the District’s general engineering
consultant at an out-of-state construction project. While employed by the
District, the employee had no direct influence upon the scope of work to be
performed or the compensation to be received by the consultant or its
affiliate. The employee’s employment with the affiliate would not prevent
the District from continuing its existing contract or entering into new
contracts with the consultant.

3.

An employee resigns from his position with the District and accepts
employment with a large automobile company. While with the District, the
employee was an administrative assistant whose duties included preparation
of a departmental budget, purchase of office supplies, and supervision of
two clerical workers. At her new company the employee is an office
manager and does not have the authority to bind the new employer or to
negotiate agreements, does not have direct or indirect dealings with the
District, and does not perform bid or proposal presentation. Since the
likelihood is remote that the knowledge or influence the employee acquired
at the District could be used by others within her new company to obtain
confidential information, the company is not “represented by” the employee,
and her new employment with the company will not prevent the District
from contracting with the company.

4.

An employee resigns from a position as an engineer at a District construction
project and takes a job at a subcontractor that has performed work on the
same construction project. The employee’s new job is as a site manager for
a number of his new employer’s construction subcontracts, none of which
currently involve District projects. The District will not be permitted to enter

into a contract with the new employer or with any prime contractor that
proposes to subcontract with the new employer.

14. Political Activity

1.

Use their official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or
affecting the result of an election or a nomination for office;

2.

Directly or indirectly coerce, attempt to coerce, command or advise a state
or local officer or employee to pay, lend or contribute anything of value to a
party, committee, or organization, agency or person for political purposes; or

3.

Be a candidate for public elective office in a partisan primary, general, or
special election.

Whenever a question arises with respect to whether an employee’s political activity is
prohibited by law or by this Code of Ethics, the person concerned should seek the advice
of the General Counsel.

15. Violation
An employee (excluding a Director) violating this Code of Ethics may be subject to
discipline up to and including termination. An employee (including a Director) violating this
Code may be subject to such action or penalties as authorized by law. A contractor
violating this Code of Ethics may be subject to disbarment from future RTD contracts, and
violation may be considered a breach of the contractor’s contract with RTD.

This Code shall be construed liberally to promote its purposes and policies and to
supplement such existing laws as may relate to the conduct of employees. This Code

Smart Media Technology
The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card which customers load and
reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass
and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All buses and light rail validators installations are complete. Additional validators will be installed as new
buses and light rail stations are commissioned into service.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 327,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
December 2017, 1.3M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide web portal
went live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the MyRide web portal was launched to the
general public. As of December 2017, approximately 18,400 cards were issued, of which 13,200
(72%) were full fare cards and 5,200 (28%) were discounted cards. The average stored value loaded
(initial purchases and reloads) was $40.80, with a total value loaded of almost $1,973,000. There were
547,200 trips taken using these MyRide cards, with a fare payment value of $1,463,000. Of these
trips: 77% were local, 20% regional and 3% airport.
Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales outlets and at Retail outlets (Safeway
and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 47
Safeway retail stores. Since launch, Safeway has processed $6,500 in cash value reloads. As of July 1,
2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores. Since launch,
King Soopers has processed $20,000 in cash value reloads.
As of January 1, 2017, Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc. separated its Business Process Services Unit into
an independent public company called Conduent. Xerox will be referred to as Conduent.

(1) Variance is due to timing of invoices for contracted services as well as parts and supplies orders lagging expectations
(2) Variance is due to the timing of rail line openings and parts and wages being lower than expected
(3) Variance is due to the timing of payment for management services
(4) Variance primarily due to the reversal of a December bill of sale for US36 assets on FasTracks and timing of multiple projects on Base System
(5) Variance is primarily due to the timing of payment for outside security services and contracted maintenance in which accruals are recorded at year-end
(6) Variance is primarily due to higher-than-expected self-insured claims for liability and worker's compensation
(7) Variance is primarily due to the timing of purchase of data processing services in which encumbrances have been incurred
(8) Variance is primarily due to the timing of production of outside promotional and informational materials and costs related to rail openings
(9) Variance due year-end accrued expenses that did not materialize
(10) $5.3m for utility taxes was refunded covering the years 2015-2017
NOTE: the Q3 2017 SB154 cost recovery ratio was 49.7% which exceeds the statutory minimum of 30.0%

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter of 2017. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance
measures tracked for the GM, RTD met 34 of the goals in the third quarter. The following is a
discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q3, but performance was
comparable to Q2. System-wide Local on-time service at 86.4% was only slightly below Q2. In
Local on-time service, both Transdev and First Transit-Longmont met/exceeded goal while the
remaining carriers did not. Regional on-time service at 86.6% did not meet goal and was slightly
below Q2. Staff will continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst performing routes and
identifying the resources needed to improve such as service changes and operator training.
Overall Light Rail on-time service exceeded goal in Q3 at 94.4%. Commuter Rail on-time service
at 92.8% also exceeded goal.
Goal 4.2 – Improve Level of Customer Complaints
In responding to customer complaints, the overall average cycle time at 10.7 days in Q3 slightly
exceeded goal. The customer service position at Access-A-Ride was vacant for much of the Q2
and Q3 reporting periods which accounted for most of the variance. The position was filled in
September.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
Ridership for year-to-date Q3 was down 1.5% compared to same time prior year which mirrored
the national trend.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Although year-to-date Q3 fare revenue was up 5.6% over same time prior year, it did not meet the
budgeted goal of 5.8%.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization

Packet Pg. 133

2.C.4

Bus operator vacancies and bus mechanic vacancies exceeded goal in Q3 due to attrition, retirements,
system growth, and the strong local economy.
