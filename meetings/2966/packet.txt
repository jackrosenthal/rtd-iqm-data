RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the recalculated base rental
schedule related to the partial refinancing of the 2010 leased property.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD issued its Series 2010A and 2010B certificates of participation (COPs) to finance the
2010 Improvement Project which included 55 new Siemens light rail vehicles, 95 access-a-Ride vehicles,
32 Call-n-Ride vehicles, fare boxes and CAD/AVL equipment. The 2010A and 2010B COPs also
refinanced the 1998A and 2001A COPs for interest expense savings. In November 2019, RTD entered
a forward delivery agreement to deliver COPs in March 2020 to refund the 2010A COPs that will save
the district a gross amount of approximately $19 million between 2020 and 2026.
DISCUSSION
The recommended resolution authorizes the recalculated principal and interest payments related to the
2010 Improvement Project to reflect the lower cost of interest achieved through the 2019 forward
delivery agreement. This authorization is a requirement to close the refunding transaction which is
currently scheduled to close on March 3, 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Upon closing of the related refunding transaction, RTD will recognize a net present value savings of
approximately $17 million or 22% which is well above the RTD Fiscal Policy requirement of 3%
minimum savings. This majority of this interest expense savings will be realized between the years
2020 and 2026.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the
recalculated base rental schedule related to the partial refinancing of the 2010 leased property.
2. Modify the recommended resolution.

However, due to delays in delivering items that were anticipated to be received and paid for in 2019,
the carryforward request included in the expense budget was not sufficient to cover all t he items
that were not received in 2019. In addition to these items not received in 2019, staff has identified
an additional $1.4 million in expense items that will be required to open the N line for revenue
service in 2020, which can be funded within the standup budget originally approved by the Board in
October 2017. Major items remaining to be delivered in 2020 include:
 Spare parts, equipment, and tools for maintenance and operational support
 Contractor services for operator training
 Contractor services for train dispatching
 Contractor services for maintenance training
 Contractor services for staff augmentation until RTD reaches full headcount for ongoing
operations
 Software for train control and dispatching
 Janitorial and maintenance services for commuter rail facilities
All of these items are needed to open the N line for revenue service on schedule, and are estimated
to cost $4.7 million.
This action also would take the $2.9 million in expense funding that was not spent in 2019, and
was not identified as needed to meet outstanding commitments or planned expenditures, and
reallocate this funding to the maintenance of way building construction.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no net financial impact to RTD. Funding for North Metro Operations standup was
included in the 2019 Amended Budget in specific expense line items. The savings to RTD from not
expending the funds in 2019 will be carried forward into 2020 and used to replenish the FasTracks
Operating Reserve at the time of the 2020 Amended Budget.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $6.910 million from
the FasTracks Operating Reserve to the North Metro Operations Standup budget, to allow for
the carryforward of standup expense funds that were budgeted but not spent in 2019. The
funds to be transferred will be allocated to the standup budget as follows:

Capital
Personnel - Contractor
Consumables and Spare Parts
Heavy Equipment
Training and On-Call Support

711 Building

The Operating Reserve will be replenished in the 2020 Amended Budget with the funds that
were not spent on North Metro standup expense in 2019.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer. This
action is not recommended because RTD still has outstanding commitments for $3.3 million
of expenses attributable to North Metro operations standup, and an additional $1.4 million
that will be needed in 2020 before the line opens for revenue service. If this transfer is not
approved, these amounts will need to be covered from the 2020 operations budget for the
corridor, which will not leave sufficient funding to operate the service for the remainder of
2020.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with
Transportation Certification Services (TCS) for operator training and train dispatch services to increase
the contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,208,000 for a total not-to-exceed contract amount of
$1,840,125. Funding for 2020 work orders to be issued under this contract will be provided through a
budget transfer to carry forward unspent 2019 expense funding.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #5 – Increase Ridership
BACKGROUND
In 2017 the RTD board directed staff to take the actions necessary to op erate the N Line, which was
under construction at the time, with in-house staff. This included hiring and training staff to operate
all functions of the line.
In May 2019, RTD awarded a contract to TCS to perform operator training for the N Line. The sole
source contract was awarded for one year, and a contract amount not-to-exceed amount of
$142,125. RTD increased the hours of training for an additional $490,000 for a total not to exceed
$632,125.
RTD also was required to provide dispatching services for the commissioning and testing of the line
prior to training and revenue operations. This function was provided through a contract with HNTB,
which provides systems services for North Metro construction, and it was funded through the North
Metro construction project.
As of the end of 2019, RTD is in the final phases of the construction and hand off from the
construction contractors and in the final steps of hiring and training operational staff.
DISCUSSION
The contract extension for TCS is expected to cover two critical areas of need to open the N Line for
revenue service: operator training and train dispatching.
This contract addresses two main issues associated with training operators for revenue service; the
need to certify all of the N Line operators to operate the trains, and the need to create, document,
and implement the ongoing training processes to meet the Federal Rail Administration’s (FRA)
requirements.

As of the end of 2019, operator training classes are still being conducted by TCS. It is projected
that, by the end of April, the new permanent RTD trainer will be on board and the initial training will
be almost concluded. This action would extend the contract through April 2020 and add an
additional $600,000 for continued operator training to allow TCS to continue training operators until
RTD is able to hire an in-house trainer.
In addition, since the construction phase is concluding and the line is transitioning to operating, the
function of dispatching trains must transition also from a construction mode to an operation mode.
The RTD Commuter Rail Dispatcher positions will be posted in January 2020. It is anticipated that
the positions will be filled by the end of February 2020, with training of the RTD Commuter Rail
Dispatchers completed by the end of March 2020. This action would allow TCS to provide RTD with
dispatching services until the RTD dispatchers are hired and trained, so that operators would be able
to complete in-rail-car operation training, and it would add $608,000 to pay for the dispatchers.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract will be provided from the North Metro standup operations budget, through a
budget transfer to carry forward unspent 2019 expense funding.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to amend the contract with Transportation Certification Services for
operator training and train dispatch services to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by
$1,208,000 for a total not-to-exceed contract amount of $1,840,125. Funding for 2020 work
orders to be issued under this contract will be provided through a budget transfer to carry
forward unspent 2019 expense funding.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the recommended increase to the
contract for TCS. Instead, wait until the new RTD trainer and dispatchers are hired, and use
those staff to perform operator training.
In this case, the trainer would need to develop all
training materials before conducting in class training and in-rail-car operation training, and the inrail-car training could not start until the new dispatchers were hired. This would result in a
significant delay in implementing operator training, which could delay the opening of the N Line
for revenue service.
