Executive Committee
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Then approved and accepted for the next board meeting. We have
a lot of retirees-- you can see on there-- and a lot of bus operators who will be retiring.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: That time of year.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, Dave, the General Manager was explaining that. The other
thing I want to talk about is all these conferences that we go to. You have an item there, a sheet
with all of them on there. And remember, we reduced our budget to $4,000 per board member, and
so we're going to send this out to see what people want to participate-LYNN GUISSINGER: Is that a separate sheet?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Did you not get it?
VINCE BUZEK: Had an extra there.
DAVE GENOVA: She's got it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
SHELLEY COOK: Here's more. Here you go.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Do you have one, Lynn?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Mm-hmm.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, OK. Anyway, so there's a lot of information on here for people
to take a look at and start thinking about where you want to go. So the Legislative Conference in
March 15th, unfortunately, Congress is in recess.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Of course.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Again.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, I was going to say, that happens every once in a while.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I was talking to APTA, and they say that they have to book it
so many years in advance that they don't know at that time if they're in session or not in session.
But I wanted to ask the executive committee if they're planning to go to that APTA Conference in
Washington in March.

SHELLEY COOK: So it says not to attend, except for the Executive Committee is basically the
message.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We just put that down as a recommendation because that came in to us.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So one of the questions was having the executive committee just
do a meeting with Jane Williams to say, hey, we're the new executive committee. We wanted to
introduce ourselves and to thank you for working with us. And we're looking-- so just relationship
building. But you're going to be bicycling in Vietnam.
[LAUGHTER]
SHELLEY COOK: I'll try to make it work.
VINCE BUZEK: What thing in Vietnam? Do they have bike paths there?
LYNN GUISSINGER: That's what I said.
VINCE BUZEK: It's like jungles.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It's not bike paths. I think it's along the very northern border.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: You told me it's beautiful, right? You said it's just beautiful.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I've seen lots of pictures. It's gorgeous, yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: Once you have the date set with Jane Williams, work.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. I've asked Sherry to start working on that like three weeks
ago, so I'll check with her. Vince?
VINCE BUZEK: I'm not certain, but put me as a maybe.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. And I know that Director Catlin was at the conference last
week and had the opportunity to meet with her as well. So I'll be anxious to hear what she has to
say about that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, it is a possibility that maybe they could get Jane Williams to come
here, and then that's-LYNN GUISSINGER: Surely there will be discussion of that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. So I mean, that would save everybody traveling, since you can't
all go anyway, and there's nothing else to do there. So I can work with Sherry on that.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, that would be great. I just think it'd be great us to have some
time-HEATHER MCKILLOP: There not going to set any meetings with staff while you guys are in
New York?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I assume they will. We'll meet with some staff.
BARBARA MCMANUS: They'll do what they can.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: There she is. Hello. Welcome back.
PEGGY CATLIN: 20 minutes to get down here and 20 minutes to find a parking space.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, I love it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We were just talking about Jane Williams. And instead of us
flying to Washington, maybe she could come here and meet the whole board. And I know you just
met with her, so-PEGGY CATLIN: Well, that was just impromptu. It was-- she spoke at TRB, and I was standing
out in the hall talking to another mutual friend. And she came up and talked to both of us. It was
kind of nice. And Dave, she had some lovely things to say about you.
DAVE GENOVA: Thank you.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Oh, that's nice.
DAVE GENOVA: Yeah she's a good person.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So we're going to see if Sherry can set something up where she
comes here.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Because I was thinking we could go to APTA and talk with her,
but Congress is out of session. So that's going to be-SHELLEY COOK: Same as last year's meeting.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, same as last year.
PEGGY CATLIN: There's also a-- I think there's a conference she's coming to in August, maybe?
Maybe not. I'm thinking of another one.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.

HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, it'd be a great opportunity, because so much has happened since
the last time, since she toured some of our facilities, so it'd be great. To show her all the openings
and new things we've done..
LYNN GUISSINGER: It'd be great.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think that might be really great to do, so I don't really-- we're in
the middle of the interim general manager stuff. Barbara, do you know about the reference checks?
Does Roger-- has he gotten them set up, because I wanted to talk with the board members who
said they wanted to be part of the reference calls.
BARBARA MCMANUS: No, I haven't heard that he has anything specific set up yet. He's waiting,
so I believe he did receive all but one of the references from the finalists, and then he'll have to set
up all of the phone conversations. He's reaching out to those folks now, but it's not done. It's not
completed.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So the way that we've been talking about it, both Director
Williams and Director Menten want to do the calls or be part of the reference calls. But I shared
with them that that was fine as long as they knew that they had to fit in to the timeline of the
reference calls, that we couldn't schedule it around them. And they said that was fine. And if they
can't make it then, I would ask other board members who are interested.
So I know that Director Guissinger and Director Cook are interested. That's all I've heard from in
terms of who is-- and Director Buzek is interested in it as well. So we'll just keep on top of it, and
then just sit and call people to see-LYNN GUISSINGER: Are we limited to only two going?
Or can we call it an executive session and-BARBARA MCMANUS: No.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, only two people can do it.
SHELLEY COOK: Maybe split up or something. I wonder if we should ask board members if any
are interested, because I had asked in the meeting if we could have a process about that, and maybe
people are waiting to indicate interest.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, I'd like that.
PEGGY CATLIN: I have some concerns about - they're just observing only, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The board members who are calling? Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: I just want to make sure that it's clear that they cannot post questions--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: --that that's up to personnel to do their job, OK, or HR, because I would be-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: I would be concerned about that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But we're waiting on that one piece, so the surveys are out. The
press release is out. The resumes are out. And so people are responding pretty quickly, right?
BARBARA MCMANUS: We had a 112 responses as of this morning on the survey, and I have
about 30 responses to the RTD GM Search mailbox.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: It's been all over Facebook and LinkedIn today.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I mean, every time I get notifications, I'm like, how do they know? So
it's been everywhere today.
VINCE BUZEK: That's good.
PEGGY CATLIN: I will compile mine and get mine to you. Some of them will be duplicate. Yeah,
do you prefer the duplicates?
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, that's a good question. Do you prefer the duplicates, or do you want us
to try to figure out if they've got lots of people that you've already got probably?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Send them to me, and if it's a duplicate, I'll delete it and just keep one.
I would rather not miss any-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --if they weren't forwarded.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm just forwarding everything. The thing that I don't know how
to forward are like when someone calls me or I have a voicemail. Do you want us to-- what do you
want us to do with those?
BARBARA MCMANUS: If you could just list it in an email. Keep an email log, and then just
send it to me, and I'll add it at the end.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But do you want us to put in there what-BARBARA MCMANUS: What their comments were?

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. OK, got it. All right. Mr. General Manager, do you have
anything?
DAVE GENOVA: I have no matters or updates. And I just got Heather to join, just for transition
purposes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Great. Heather, do you have anything?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: No, I don't right this second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So please extend our well wishes to Bill Sirois and his broken
ankle from ice skating last night. [CHUCKLES] He got a hair fracture. That's what we've been
told.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, my goodness.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, so-- yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: There is a joint ASHTO, TRB, and IBTTA conference being held here in May.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, good.
PEGGY CATLIN: And they are going to be doing a tour of E47 ME and I don't know what other
HPTE thing that they're going to do. But they wanted to do a tour of the US 36 bus lanes, or US
36 project. And I brought it up to them saying, I wish you would include RTD, because that
corridor is a really good corridor to demonstrate absolute high performance, if you will. And they
said they would.
And so I'd be happy to coordinate that, but I just think that if they do a tour of US 36, we ought to
be a part of it, because one of the things that's coming up, they really want to now incorporate
more and more transit, BRT/Express and Planning. And in fact, in Atlanta, they call them Express
Transit Lanes. So-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Ooh, we need to start using that-I love that. I love that. But anyway, I just wanted to let you know that that's in May. I'll get the
exact date. Where
VINCE BUZEK: Peggy, you said, IBTTA, ASHTO, and who else?
BARBARA MCMANUS: TRB.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: TRB.
DAVE GENOVA: TRB.

PEGGY CATLIN: IBBTA, TRB, ASHTO International Transportation Finance Summit, May 7
through 9. Here's the number.
BARBARA MCMANUS: May 7 through 9.
PEGGY CATLIN: And so I think we may be posting our congestion pricing, which is now
incorporated into the transportation demand management fee. Our major meeting at the same time.
But they're going to be doing-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Shows the finance on it.
PEGGY CATLIN: Central 70 US 36, as well as some others, but because of US 36. RTB would
be incorporated, so I'll pass it around.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah? Maybe we can get more support for the
It's got transit lanes and other things that don't have to be separated for normal. I mean, that's where
we need to go so we can start being eligible for the used new starts.
PEGGY CATLIN: I was really interested in that.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Great.
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's really up your alley, madam.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Can you make a copy of this, send it out to all of them?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So John sent out an email yesterday afternoon about committee
assignments and people who are interested in which committees. I'm starting to get responses from
everybody, so I'm going to pull that all together and have you guys take a look at it because I think
we should take a look at it as an executive committee to move him forward. But we are starting to
get people.
We did the seating chart. It was really easy. What was so funny is Director Lewis wanted to move
to the other side so she can be by the new people. And she was like, I wanted to just meet with
new people, but Mihalik is next to her on the other side. So I think-[LAUGHTER] So that went pretty easy. It should be fun. You know what? I talked to, I think,
everybody here about being in favor of an executive search for the permanent general manager,
and everybody said they were OK with that. Correct?
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So here's what I'd like to do is I'd like to take the board list and
split it up amongst us to do the call, because we've got to do it next week. And so we're on a time
crunch. That's the first thing.
The second thing is, one the questions was, do we change the job description or update it or what
is it? How many of you think we need to do that?
LYNN GUISSINGER: I have to look at it again.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah, I think we need to look through-- yeah, take a look at it and see.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Could I have you take a look at it today and get comments back,
like in the next day, because we really need to move this process along just so we get it going.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I have copies for everyone.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I was going to say, a new copy would be appreciated.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Madam Chairman, may ask a question?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, ma'am.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So I need to move money around, and so I just want to know what the
best opportunity to do that is so that I can move sufficient funds to cover that. And I know there's
not a final decision, but I would like to have that money there when you guys make a decision. If
you don't end up using it, then you don't end up using it.
But I don't know if I-- I mean, we talked about maybe doing it the last FA&A meeting, and that
seemed premature based on not getting to that quite point yet. I don't know if we can bring it on to
the 28th's agenda as a-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We can bring it on as an action item in a special board meeting.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: When's the special board meeting?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: General Manager.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: OK. So if I prepare that and send it to Barbara-- I just don't want to get
to the point where you guys made a decision and then you go, oh, crap, there's not money to put
the requisition in, right? I'd rather be ahead of that. So I'll work with Barbara on a dollar amount,
and then we'll take it out of the contingency. And then if you don't use it, we put it back in the
contingency.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, that would be great.

VINCE BUZEK: Yeah, that'd be great.
DAVE GENOVA: Is it beyond the $250,000 threshold?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Probably, because I'm assuming it might be for the search firm and a
potential PR wing. At least that's what's been done in the past, so I just-- we can make sure we
have enough in there. And then if you don't use it, you don't.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think that's a great idea. If we could call everybody today just to
get a head nod of, yeah, we're going to move forward with this, I think that would be really helpful.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Is that the question? Are we good moving forward on the-- we're hiring aANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: An executive search.
LYNN GUISSINGER: --putting out an RFP.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: RFP, yeah. I think we just need to communicate with them. That's
really all I think. Go ahead.
SHELLEY COOK: Some of what we consider to be important in the job description may change
or evolve as we get through things. And is it true-- I mean, I'm recalling from prior executive
searches-- can that be part of what the executive search firm helps us to refine?
LYNN GUISSINGER: What was that you said?
SHELLEY COOK: Well, the parts of the job description may emerge as more important than
others right now, just because of-LYNN GUISSINGER: They can definitely help you work it out.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, so maybe we cannot firm up the job description.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Leave the job description alone.
SHELLEY COOK: And maybe build that into whatever we list as their work-BARBARA MCMANUS: They can add it to the RFP as an ask.
DAVE GENOVA: There'd be a lot of opportunity to do that.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, they'll help you work through by just listening to you, what things
appear to be important. And then they can put that in a-PEGGY CATLIN: So then the RFP needs to include refined job descriptions.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Exactly.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. so just so you know for the permanent general manager
search, Director Catlin is going to be the chair of that. And we had talked about it being a
committee of seven, which is what it was last time. And then people would have buddies. And so
that would incorporate the whole board. So I'll turn it over to you. What do you think you need in
terms of the committee salary? She just got a bite. [CHUCKLES]
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, the pickle.
SHELLEY COOK: Is there a way we could avoid some of the cost with Pauletta's heft in terms of
the outreach or anything like that? That would be a question.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I already spoke to her about that, and she said that if the board chose to
do that, then they would have to choose other things that she has been tasked with, that would not
have to happen this year.
SHELLEY COOK: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: To answer your question, I think we need you to gauge interest among other
board members to see-- I know there were some other board members who were interested. At one
time, we spoke about people that may or may not have time commitments to devote what was last
time 34 meetings to this out of respect for them. But they need to self-determine that. So-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: 34. 34.
PEGGY CATLIN: So I think we need-- when we call the board members about Okaying the
executive search firms and possibly PR, let's all ask them again if they would be interested in
serving on a committee that could consist of quite a bit of time and meetings, and if they would
like to, or if they would prefer to have somebody-- be a buddy that somebody else could
communicate with.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think it's a great idea.
PEGGY CATLIN: And if we don't get seven, then we may have to settle for five.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And just if we-- I know there was a little talk about it, but is it clear what
the executive search committee and the search committee bring to the board, really? Is the task to
bring the top 10 resumes or something? Or what happens?
PEGGY CATLIN: I want to look at the process that happened last time and then craft a --

SHELLEY COOK: I agree. That would be great too. Circulate-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I do think it's really important, though, to reiterate the amount of
time this is going to take. And if you're going to be on this committee, you really need to commit
to it. You can't just say yes and then not come.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And if we do reiterate it, I mean, if we can kind of say exactly what comes
back to the board. Where are the decisions being made and that sort of thing. That would be helpful
too.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I guess people are going to say, what's a buddy? And what
do I have to do with this person? It would be really helpful to have, so if you could just send us a
little blurb, Director Catlin. And then when we call, we could ask those questions. That would be
helpful.
PEGGY CATLIN: See what comes back to board and what is the buddy?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That would be, I think, really, really helpful.
PEGGY CATLIN: Little blurb is not going to come today. Sorry. I got home at 10:50 last night,
so I need time to catch up.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Got it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You've got it. So the other part of it is that looking at the board
list, before you leave, could you tell me who you'll call so that we have everybody covered? I made
all 15 last time. It took a hot afternoon minute.
[LAUGHTER]
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm sorry. Thank you for doing that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, no, that's OK, but I was getting really good at hitting-[CHUCKLES] of where to go. OK, just a couple of other things that I want to share, and then you
guys, I want to hear from you. I went to the metro mayor's caucus meeting last Saturday, and it
was very, very well attended. And I was able to really connect with a lot of different mayors, and
I'm having lunch with Mayor Atchison on Friday.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, great.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I tried to make-Atchison.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Act-- at-PEGGY CATLIN: Atchison I can't. I'm going to call him-VINCE BUZEK: Herb.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --yeah, Herb. I'll call him Herb.
[LAUGHTER]
And I talked to Mayor Hancock. And so I'm meeting with Sayers who's his new regional person.
And then Josh and I'm not going to say his last name right-- Lay-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Laipply.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The only way I know how to tell you is he's the new Diane Barrett.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And he's great.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, and so-PEGGY CATLIN: He used to be a Chief Engineer at CDOT.
LYNN GUISSINGER: What's the new Diane Barrett name?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, Diane Barrett was the overseer of all the big projects in the
city for the mayor. It's a pretty big deal. And he just came from CDOT. They recruited him from
CDOT.
LYNN GUISSINGER: What's his name?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Josh.
PEGGY CATLIN: Josh Laipply.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Laipply.
DAVE GENOVA: If I may, Chair, we meet every two weeks with him. So we were meeting every
two weeks with Diane. And so the critical things that kind of surface up between us, that's usually
the focal point, like if we can't get to resolution on working through things. Then they come up to
my level and Josh's level. But we meet every two weeks, and that's usually Heather, the GM, and
Bill Van Meter, and others, just dependent on the topic. But we have kind of a standing meeting.
We don't meet every-- sometimes we cancel them if we don't have an agenda item. But I just
wanted you--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. So it's the next one. It's the 21st for like at noon. Do
you want to go with me?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Sure.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. I'll send it to you.
DAVE GENOVA: That's the metro mayor's-- is that the transportation committee?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, that's Josh, the Josh meeting.
PEGGY CATLIN: Madam Chair, if I might-- you talked about you wanted to meet with each and
every mayor. But there are a number of jurisdictions that are not represented by a mayor, Jefferson
County being one of them, perhaps Douglas County, parts of Adams County. So we do need to
expand that-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I agree.
PEGGY CATLIN: --to include the commissioners.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, I agree. But being at the Metro Mayors Caucus, I did stand
up and say we wanted to meet with every one of them just to extend our hand of friendship and
collaboration. We really need to sit down and roll up our sleeves together.
PEGGY CATLIN: This is just for the record. I didn't want to exclude those-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, no. Thank you. So I also received a phone call yesterday
afternoon from Chris Nevitt, who oversees the TOD for the city and county of Denver. And he
shared with me that-- he said, I'm sorry that we haven't stepped up to the plate and supported RTD
as publicly as we should. And we're going to change that.
And so Jordan Sayers is the new regional director for the mayor. And he has tasked her with
working directly with RTD. And I know Jordan from working in the community. So having lunch
with Chris Nevitt to see what it is he's thinking about and Jordan and Josh. So I have a lot of
meetings with the City of Denver in the next couple of weeks. So I'll keep you guys updated. But
I think it's great that they're reaching out.
PEGGY CATLIN: Just food for thought, Director Walker has a really good relationship with Chris
Nevitt. And it might be worthwhile to ask Jeff if he would like to participate.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'll call him and ask him if he'd like to join. We haven't set it up
yet, so I can include him in that thing.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I also met yesterday with the Downtown Denver Partnership and
did a presentation, a lot of like what I did today for the Leadership Academy. And it was really a
great, robust conversation. And they had some things to say, and I shared with them that our vision
was really inclusion and openness. And I was able to give them the information about the survey,
which was kind of nice to have something right off the chute to say here, here's our first shot at
this as the new year executive committee and stuff.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Which survey?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The interim general management, because the press release had
gone out. So I was able to talk about that. But one of the things that I did share with them that I
shared with the Metro Mayors Caucus and that I shared with Senator Tate is really something I
want to use a lot, which is that RTD has not really been looked at as a viable member of these
plans of action. And so with all of this luring of businesses at the governor's office, the mayor's
office, and they're paying businesses to come to Denver and to Colorado and trying to lure them
in to be here.
Rather than doing that, funding RTD for infrastructure and capital components and really investing
in the transportation. That's what they really need because then businesses will come organically.
And actually, when I said that to Senator Tate about his bill, it kind of stopped him cold and he
said he never thought about that before.
But I do think that we need to start saying, it's going to take all of us to move this agency forward.
But all of us, not just RTD. It can't be a siloed thing anymore. We need to work in unison, because
if this transportation district is not successful, they're not going to be either. And so that is
something that I've been doing, so it's-LYNN GUISSINGER: Great.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I have met with a whole bunch of folk in the last week and two
days. [LAUGHS] But I think it's great. I think people are really supportive. They really want to
work with us. They've all called and said, you let us know how we can work together and how we
can move forward.
I met with the CAC yesterday. They really want to be involved. And Bill Sirois was there. I really
want them to go with us to pop-up sessions and different things. They were like, please use us. We
really are anxious to do this stuff.
PEGGY CATLIN: And by "we," you're really focusing on the board?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I am.

PEGGY CATLIN: Staff has done and have really worked hard to try and engage people, but the
board hasn't necessarily stepped up as much as we could have to make that mark.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, I think that's the message is that
PEGGY CATLIN: Wanted to clarify that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. We as the board need to step up and make sure that we're
working in collaboration with the CAC. And maybe we buddy up a CAC person.
PEGGY CATLIN: And one of the other stakeholders that you're talking about.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So Chair, a day after that, I just-- we talked this morning about when
they do the pop-up events for Reimagine, if we have a director and a CAC person at those pop-ups
to just sort of observe, hear what the community is saying, bring that back, one to the board and to
the CAC, that we thought that that would be helpful as well. And I'm going to work with Bill to
get that set up when those are put in place.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So that will be helpful. The other thing I just want to share with
you-- I wanted to thank you for sitting in on the CPR interview. I thought it was really great that
we all were there together. And I met with Tina Jaquez yesterday afternoon and asked her to talk
to Pauletta about doing the same thing with Andy from Street's Blog, since there was some real
inconsistent information. So I'm hoping to get that set up. And it would be the entire executive
committee again.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think that'd be great.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah I'll let you know
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for doing that. I appreciate that. I know that when CPR first reached out
to you, they just wanted to talk to you, and you included everyone. I appreciate that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Went that well?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I thought it went very well.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I just want to give you a heads up too that I've been doing some in-depth
meetings with Nate. He's the one that is receptive to them. We've hawked it to other people just to
spend more time going through the budget and how the whole processes work. So I spent a couple
hours with him a couple weeks ago, and he seemed very appreciative. But I just wanted to let you
know that was going on too so you weren't blindsided by that. But I don't know if it's going to help.

But if you guys have meetings with other people, you can always offer us up as staff to have those
more in-depth sidebar meetings too with them.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm sorry.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, go ahead. Is Pauletta going to follow up on his recommendations about
the CORA? It could be a dialogue if, wherever-- they don't want that to disappear, I guess, is my
question.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, they clearly have-- the recalled-- they compared us to CDOT.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Usually with CDOT, they're able to kind of
dialogue and figure out what's the information, the best way to get to it.
LYNN GUISSINGER: They would call back and say, I'm not sure this is what you really want,
but here's what you might want. And he said they get the stuff more quickly with-SHELLEY COOK: Sometimes less work, yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: That's actually under legal, not with Pauletta. And I actually had that
conversation with James because Nate told me that the other night when I was talking to him too.
And I think part of our situation has been is that we've had three people-- they were four people in
that position in the last year.
LYNN GUISSINGER: In the CORA position?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah. They've gone through a lot. Now I know they're in the process of
hiring them, so I think we could start out that conversation with the new person right off the bat,
to have that dialogue. But I think that's been part of our problem and also in our responsiveness,
because we send it to where we're supposed to send it to. And then we find out. Like I found out
from Nate he didn't get something I had sent, and I sent it a week ago, back to the CORA mailbox.
So I think that's-- I mean, not that it's an excuse-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, but it's good to know.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --that we've had a big turnover in that particular area, and we're bringing
on somebody new here shortly. So we could get them set off on a good foot with that. So I'll talk
to James about that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thanks for letting us know, because we didn't know.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. No, that's-- thank you.

PEGGY CATLIN: Sorry, microphone.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's all right. Do you have anything? Does anybody else have
anything? Yes, ma'am.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So we will need two executive committee members and maybe Director
Catlin is one with one other to oversee the legal contract for the negotiation if an external candidate
is chosen. I have a copy of-- we went through the hiring process, and we chose Davis Brandon
Stubbs. And the principal on that will be Brett Painter. So I have a copy of the RFP response here
for you, Director Catlin. So if we could make that decision, we'll have to set up a meeting to just
set expectations for him should we need that in the near future.
PEGGY CATLIN: So the decision is whether or not we do want to go with Davis Brandon Stubbs
or-BARBARA MCMANUS: No, they're already chosen.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's how we want to move forward with them.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: --negotiating the interim GM contract or-BARBARA MCMANUS: If it's an external person, yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: I kind of agreed with the idea of not paying the fees associated with any
attorney that the person selects, that Natalie brought up. I don't know if this is incorporated in thisBARBARA MCMANUS: Well, that would be part of the conversation we would have with Brett
Painter, that we didn't want to. We can't say whether or not that is a negotiation point or not.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, I think that's just a thing that you negotiate.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I mean, if it's this, that, the other.
SHELLEY COOK: I don't want to assume it, is what I'm saying.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Who else would like to work with Director Catlin on this?

PEGGY CATLIN: Don't all speak at once.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, did you see?
VINCE BUZEK: If it was anyone else-SHELLEY COOK: Two attorneys here could help, I suppose.
VINCE BUZEK: And we're not lying. I'd be happy to.
PEGGY CATLIN: That would be great.
LYNN GUISSINGER: He's a real attorney.
VINCE BUZEK: Aw, Lynn, you're an attorney too. Come on.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, so Director Buzek, thank you. Got him.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Once an attorney, always an attorney.
VINCE BUZEK: That's right.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Let's agree that we're going to move on.
LYNN GUISSINGER: He's got skills, but you don't want to be dealing without having malpractice
insurance and all that.
VINCE BUZEK: What? You have to have that? [LAUGHTER]
LYNN GUISSINGER: You don't need it.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah, that's right.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: This seems really short to me, but is there anything-- am I missing
anything?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, yes, because they're coming in to speak about Re-Imagine.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, that's right. There's that piece.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Let me just circle back and see where we references.
PEGGY CATLIN: Did we approve the board agenda?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, we did. OK.

LYNN GUISSINGER: Where we are on the references, are we going to-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So the references were from January 15th through the 22nd, but
Roger is still working on getting the references going, right?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. So we have-- I think he's going to try to get them done by the end
of next week.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And did you say you were going to-- I mean, I'd like to sit in on some of
them I know. How are we going to figure that out, I guess-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, we'll find out when they're actually going to be calling them,
and then we can let people know is how I think we can do it, because we're not asking the questions.
They are, but we can sit in on them.
SHELLEY COOK: Do we know what questions they're asking, or is it-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think they are the HR questions that they ask of everybody. So
we had our opportunity to do our eight questions. Now this is the HR department's place of how
they do their questioning of it.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Just to let you know, we can only ask certain questions that are legal to
ask.
PEGGY CATLIN: That's why I said, observe only.
SHELLEY COOK: Maybe we should get that schedule. We could see what they're planning to
ask. That would be helpful.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Maybe we could ask Roger what the questions are that they ask
ahead.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --give them to you. And I just also caution, too, that if the person on the
end knows that there's board members on the line, they're probably going to be more reserved in
their responses than they would otherwise be. I know I would be. When I get reference checks,
and if there was a board member, I would not say the same thing I would if there was not a board
member.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The next question is, if it was just the HR person, if the advantage
is greater candor, how do they then reflect that? Do we get a verbatim transcript? Or how is that
then sent back to us?
VINCE BUZEK: Are those recorded ? Could we record those?
LYNN GUISSINGER: They could be.

HEATHER MCKILLOP: You could, as long as you tell the person before you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That might be a way to do it, so then all board members could
hear them.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It might have a chilling effect, too, I think.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Absolutely will.
DAVE GENOVA: That could, yeah. Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I just think one of the things you get when you-- most of what you get
in those reference checks is people voluntarily telling you stuff, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Just because I do a lot of them.
PEGGY CATLIN: You can only ask the legal questions.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes. And so it just might have a chilling effect if they're recorded or
there are board members on there. That's all I offer up. I'm not telling you not to do it. I'm just
saying.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No, no, no. It's a good concern.
PEGGY CATLIN: No, I agree.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: I guess-- well, wrong question, that question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, I mean, I think clearly the board said that they wanted to
participate in the questions, like the HR reference checks. But I'm wondering when we're doing
our call about executive search if they would be OK since we're not asking any questions. We've
done our questions already if we recorded them. And then they'd be available for board members
to hear.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I just wonder if that's going to-- I mean, that's a reasonable solution.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It is.
LYNN GUISSINGER: It just may have the same chilling effect.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it's going to be chilly either way. So
do we-- maybe what we do is we can get a hold of the questions that are asked and tell the board

that these are the questions that will be asked. And we could ask for them to be recorded. But it
could really cause someone not to be frank.
SHELLEY COOK: Their ideas would go back to somebody listening in.
PEGGY CATLIN: I mean, HR knows how to do its job. And we know how to ask these questions.
And they know how to-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Interpret the response.
PEGGY CATLIN: And gather additional information just like pregnant pauses. It works. So I
mean, I personally trust them to do a good job and to document their discussions and report to us
what they learned.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And I think that-- I totally agree with you, that they're doing their job. But
what you lose are those pregnant pauses or the stuttering over-- I mean, to me, you only hire
someone who gets rave reviews. That's my bottom line when I'm hiring. But there is some loss in
not hearing it.
PEGGY CATLIN: That's true.
BARBARA MCMANUS: There will be some loss in interpretation as well. It's all different
directors just listening to all different candidates.
SHELLEY COOK: So back to the question of what Roger brings back to us, if he is the person
conducting all the interviews and then rendering some like, what does he bring to us is the question.
Is it just like these were good, generally? Or there was some concern about x. Or how does that
get reflected back to us? Or is it kind of a pass/fail thing. Do you know?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I didn't ask that question, because I thought directors would be there so
I can ask that.
SHELLEY COOK: I kind of agree with the idea of somebody listening in or having some way to
gauge that intangible piece.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Tell him what you want him to tell you. I mean, when he does reference
checks for me, I say, I want to know this, this, and this. How did they respond to-- I mean,
hopefully, people are not giving-- I mean, you've got a problem if somebody's giving you a
reference and they don't have glowing reports. And it's how you interpret those glowing reports
and what their strengths or weaknesses are, according to their references, versus what they think
their strengths and weaknesses are. But just tell Roger-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Can we get Roger to come down?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah. I mean, tell Roger what you're interested in hearing back from
them.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And then he can help make sure he elicits those responses.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I know what he's doing right now is just calling the references
to see when they're available to speak. So we have a little time to maybe talk to him and say, we
know you're the expert, but how are we going to know-HEATHER MCKILLOP: How are we going to get the feedback?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, how are we going to get the feedback?
PEGGY CATLIN: I still believe that there are a couple of board members who will insist on
listening in. So I don't think we can-- I think we should agree not to do that, since we've gotten
feedback that they want.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But do we have them actually physically come in and listen in?
Or do we have-PEGGY CATLIN: I think that's the only way they can do it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, we were talking about recording them, right?
SHELLEY COOK: There's an alternative-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: If there's an alternative where it can just be a recorded session,
then anybody, any board member, could listen to them.
VINCE BUZEK: But then the question is, which has the bigger chilling effect, knowing they're
being recorded, or knowing that there's just a couple board members listening. I would think the
recording would have a bigger chilling effect on people's comments. That's the only concern.
BARBARA MCMANUS: It might be true.
VINCE BUZEK: I don't know. Maybe they don't care.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I think it depends on the person.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I do too. And then I don't know about you. I always forget that
I'm being recorded, and I just start talking.
VINCE BUZEK: You'll never talk men into being recorded.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, for a hot minute, you'd remember it.

LYNN GUISSINGER: I'd probably lean towards sticking with letting a couple of people come to
the things. But that's just my vote.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And Roger said that would be fine. He said that would be great.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I think he thought it would be the same two for everyone.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think he did too.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I have to let him know it would be different ones, but I don't know
how he feels about that.
PEGGY CATLIN: Can you say Directors Menten and Williams have expressed a desire to listen
and observe, not participate?
Are you OK with them doing that?
LYNN GUISSINGER: No.
SHELLEY COOK: Or actually, a couple of us have said it also.
And I wouldn't be surprised if others on the board, but-BARBARA MCMANUS: But what I communicated to him was that it would be two, and that that
same two would be in each of those sessions so that it would be consistent. If it's going to be all
over the place, then I have to communicate that to him and-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And do we want to open it up to that? Because when we talked
about it in the special board meeting, and we said, this came up, the only two that said, I want to
do that were Director Menten and Director Williams. And nobody else said anything.
SHELLEY COOK: Actually, I requested a process back from him that would allow us to weigh in
if we wished or something.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, I think I had mentioned it at some point-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, then, OK, so then we need to go back and talk to Roger
about that and then get back to you guys.
SHELLEY COOK: See how important the consistency is, since they're not participating and what
he reflects, as well as the board members added element is fine if it's coming from different people.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, got it. So we can go talk to Roger after this.
SHELLEY COOK: And if it is a big issue, I'm fine with leaving it to those two but would be
interested in what Roger comes back with.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Great. Anything else? Yes. Oh, yeah, Reimagine. We have
Reimagine. I keep forgetting Reimagine. [LAUGHS]
You don't have class today, do you?
SHELLEY COOK: I do.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: What time?
SHELLEY COOK: I probably should get down there if I'm taking the bus back with that.
We're going to be meeting. Are you able to meet and spend a second with them?
BILL VAN METER: Yes, I'm Bill Sirois.
LYNN GUISSINGER: You're Bill Sirois?
SHELLEY COOK: You've grown.
BILL VAN METER: Yeah. [LAUGHS]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You got taller. [CHUCKLES]
BILL VAN METER: There you go, exactly.
[SIDE CONVERSATION]
We've all heard Bill Sirois broke an ankle.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So sorry.
BILL VAN METER: [LAUGHS]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Look at you laugh, Brian.
VINCE BUZEK: I told him, ice dancing.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: You told him?
[SIDE CONVERSATION]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Welcome.
BILL VAN METER: Thank you.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Sorry you had to wait.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
BILL VAN METER: No problem at all. We had a good time gossiping out there-- not about you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: That would've been boring.
BILL VAN METER: Yeah, that would. So would you like me to take it away?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Take it away. Start with introductions.
BILL VAN METER: Indeed. Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning and-BRIAN WELCH: Brian Welch. I'm the Project Manager for Reimagine RTD.
CHRISTINA ZAZUETA: Community engagement. I'm working with Reimagine Team
JULIE SKEEN: And I'm Julie Skeen. I'm the Deputy Project Manager on the consulting side for
Reimagine.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Welcome.
BILL VAN METER: Thank you. So thanks for taking the time in your busy day. I'll try to be
relatively brief, but I wanted to take some time to update you on where we are right now with
Reimagine RTD and where we're going over the next months and prep you a little bit for some
upcoming discussions that we'll have for you and give you an opportunity to ask some questions.
So given all of the issues that you are currently addressing and also kind of trying to time in
advance of the RTD Board Retreat we thought it pretty appropriate to just make sure you're all on
the same page regarding where we are on the Reimagine process. And as you all know, we're
planning on meeting individually with all board members, hopefully, before that meeting. So
you've got the chance to ask staff where are you, where are you going, and we got a chance to hear
from you, what your thoughts and input and direction is as well. So looking forward to that. That's
really going to be helpful for staff.
Another impetus for coming right now is the fact that some stakeholders-- we've heard it and
suspect that you have as well-- there might be some suggestions given the state of flux at the
agency right now that maybe we make changes to scope and schedule for Reimagine. We aren't
terribly supportive of that. We want to stay the course and so that's the key message that I want to
run through with you today as to why we think it's really important to stay the course, not just from
time, budget, and schedule, which is a key thing to the project manager and to me and to BTU as
well, of course. But a number of other points that we want to make related to that.

And first is really in light of and in relation to the current service adjustments and reductions that
we're considering for May. It's a pretty significant lift for staff and for the board to understand that.
We understand that.
The way we see Reimagine RTD fitting into that process is key and one of the key things I want
to communicate To you. So step 1 is already underway, and that is the May service adjustments
and reductions that will be bringing our service levels more in line with our labor resources. And
you understand the clear objective there is to reduce mandating to a more manageable-- I'll use the
word "manageable"-- level.
So then what Reimagine RTD gives us the opportunity to do and the timing to do is to bring the
System Optimization Plan component. That's step 2 of the process. So focusing on System
Optimization Plan, we think it's pretty key, how it's going to provide a target for a short-term, nearterm service plan to help-- addressing how to deploy our services and resources.
Once we've reached that more manageable level of service, it follows kind of directly on the heels
of the May service changes. And so you know the scope. We've talked with you. The scope clearly
lays out working with writers, working with our stakeholders. Of course, taking direction from the
board and working closely with you, elected officials, our employees, as well, to work through
that System Optimization Plan.
To call a target for that is to have the board adopt the System Optimization Plan and route changes
by the end of this year. So we are starting to crank up very heavily on the technical analysis side
toward that adoption by the end of this year. Recommendations this summer and prioritization for
late this spring and the summer, seeing the data and how it will impact our passengers. So that will
then align us for the capability to implement the second phase, the System Optimization Plan in
2021.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I'm sorry. What did you want to have done by the end of the summer?
BILL VAN METER: So by the end of the summer is a clear understanding of what our preferred
alternative is, taking that out and to the public in the fall and looking for board action by the end
of this year, of 2020, so that we can implement in 2021.
SHELLEY COOK: Bill, I'm going to have to leave pretty quickly, but I'm going to meet with Bill
Sirois next week with Angie. So when does the Reimagine part come in, the parts where we're
factoring in our new tool box, the flexible services, and stuff like that?
BILL VAN METER: Exactly. Well, that will come in, to some extent, as part of the System
Optimization Plan. And we have current tools in the tool box, Flex Ride, and others, that will be
analyzed, looked at, and we'll look at opportunities for expanding those, for expanding coverage.
We'll be looking at opportunities for focusing more service for cost effectiveness, the very sorts of
issues that Jarrett Walker kicked this thing off with. Those are existing tools in our tool box. They
will be part of the System Optimization Plan.

SHELLEY COOK: Do they reflect a conceptualization that goes back to basic assumptions about
what our service system and network should be like? I was thinking we would have a chance to
revisit that before we optimize.
BILL VAN METER: Yeah, that is part of the optimization process, exactly. That's what we'll be
doing this spring and early summer, leading to kind of the development of a final selection and the
trade-offs between those sorts of issues.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you very much. Yeah. And then the third step is mobility plan for the
future. One of the things that we've been observing in staff is that some of our stakeholders are
getting confused between System Optimization Plan, more specific, short-term, financially
constrained. We're also going to have a financially unconstrained version of that. If we had more
resources, what would we do?
LYNN GUISSINGER: That's the mobility plan for the future?
BILL VAN METER: No, I'm sorry. That's the SOP, the System Optimization Plan.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Financially planned, constrained and unconstrained.
BILL VAN METER: We're going to have both of those. Mobility plan for the future is saying, 3
to 30 years out, to 2050, where do we go? In the fiscally constrained, once again, and unconstrained
environment. So SOP, System Optimization Plan, we'll use that acronym indiscriminately. And so
I need to be careful and clear. Short-term, near-term action this year, a lot of considerations, a lot
of decisions to be made, a lot of dialogue and involvement to be had. But within our own resources,
it will also have a look at an unconstrained version. What could we do if we had more resources?
And then a longer term vision, 2, 3 to 30 years out. What more can we, should we be doing? That
also has a fiscally constrained and an unconstrained intent in element. I'm separating those two in
my discussion, because they're separated in scope of work. They're separated in schedule and how
we're planning to deliver them.
And what I want to make clear is our focus right now, we intend to be on the System Optimization
Plan. It follows naturally from the May proposed service changes and reductions. It gives us an
opportunity to kind of make the discussion more positive. It's going to be tough, because there will
be decisions to make. And you've heard that or reiterated, and then we'll be pushing you into it. So
part of what I'm doing right now is giving you a heads up on that.
Mobility plan for the future, it's confusing some stakeholders. They're thinking that what we're
diving into right now, System Optimization Plan near-term, is the long-term mobility plan for the
future. They're conflating the two. We want to slow down the discussion on that, because we see
near-term/short-term system optimization as a clear priority.
We don't want to confuse stakeholders. We don't want to confuse you. We don't want to confuse
the issues. And we want to give, frankly, the new general manager an opportunity to work with

the board and put their imprint on that longer range future. So there's some rationale and thinking
that we have for that. I want to be clear with you on that.
I think this is going to help engender trust from stakeholders. Our intent, we've discussed a number
of times with you, just to take direction with you. But make more clear board stakeholders' input
around our service philosophy and use this as a vehicle for those discussions.
Financial concerns, had a number of discussions with Heather. One piece that we're not planning
on slowing down is the financial analysis piece. So lining up with development of the mid-term
financial plan, the need for development of the long-range plan, and approval to conduct a COGS
2050 process, and for all our own good, planning, processes, and practices.
The intent is, this year, stay the course and get you the financial information, the opportunities and
constraints that we're projecting.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Is that underway?
BILL VAN METER: That is underway.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, mmm, hmm.
BILL VAN METER: Yeah, please.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So I think one thing I need to make aware is, even though we're really
concentrating on the near term of the SOP, we still have to produce a 2050 plan this year. So we
have to go out to 2050. We know that there are issues in that, based on not being able to adopt one
this year because of issues around service and assets.
And so I just want to prepare everybody. And that's why we're not slowing down, because we want
to make sure we have the financial information. We want to use the unfunded quarter matrix.
We've talked with a consultant about incorporating that into there. They're already started doing
the who's doing what around the country and the world right now analysis. So we want to keep
that going because we want that still to inform the constrained plan, even though it would be great
to also have an unconstrained plan. It would be helpful for the board, I think, to make decisions.
But we just can't get there from here.
So we'll still have to adopt something, but we want to inform as much as possible with the work
that the consultant's doing on. that. We also are running concurrently-- because I get a lot of
questions about the fare issue-- we're running concurrently a discussion around fares. And we're
going to be using some of the board workshops that we usually have around budget. We have five
of them set up to help us have some special breakouts with the consultant and you guys, which is
a different consultant, on the fare discussion too.
PEGGY CATLIN: Forgive me. Are those calendar plus five workshops?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes. Yes. They're all on the first week calendar.

PEGGY CATLIN: I have. I've printed that out. I have a question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes please.
PEGGY CATLIN: A number of us have been interviewed by state auditor staff. And they have
not formulated their plan yet. And they're also getting some input from external folks. So that being
said, I am all for sticking with it. Personally, I'm all for sticking with the course, proceeding as
planned. But given the outcome of some state audit on legislation we may have to be nimble and
adjust scope and schedule. I just think that wouldn't be.
BILL VAN METER: Or direction of the analysis-- I hope not.
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, who knows?
BILL VAN METER: A curveball may come our way.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
BILL VAN METER: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Heather, I just wanted to clarify, I was specifically told that an examination of
fares was not going to be part of Reimagine.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: It's not part of Reimagine, but because of things doing with the accountbased ticketing system, and we might have to make some adjustments to fare policy to make that
work better and be more easier to use for our customers. [CHUCKLES] In addition to, I've heard
loud and clear the board wants to have that conversation. We set up these workshops with our
other consultant that's doing that work for us. And so we'll be holding those. And then that
information will feed into the Reimagine process. But it's part of the Reimagine's consultant work.
It's not in their scope of work. It's in a different scope of work.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks for the clarification.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, cool.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think that pulling the two apart like you're doing, Bill-- and I know it's
been pulled apart all along, and we've been telling people it's pulled apart-- but I think that's a big
piece of the problem, where people say, why is it taking RTD two years? And I have to say, well,
there are two big pieces in the System Optimization Plan, which is this whole coverage. That's this
year.

And then we're looking at a longer term strategic plan sort of thing. But I think the more-- I don't
know if we create a part one, part two kind of thing. And I know we've been saying this, but I do
think that that's a big piece of the confusion that's going on out there.
At the same time, I think that there is-- having an advisory committee meeting every two months,
there is some loss in continuity, and memory. And I asked somebody on the committee the other
day, who's very knowledgeable, about the last meeting and that whole matrix. And she's like, oh,
god, I didn't know I've got to what we were, you know. So we don't want to take too much of their
time, but two months is a big time lag.
BILL VAN METER: Yeah, good point. And so some of the things that I've been thinking about is
perhaps midpoint or alternating months, updates.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BILL VAN METER: Informational update. Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: What we did last time and here's how we're using it with our consultants.
BILL VAN METER: Exactly, something to follow up and keep where we were and where we're
going.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And I would offer a-- and maybe this doesn't fit into the plan-- but in
the past working group, what we did too is we had people that were interested in working in just
little pieces of it, and providing input. And what that allowed is people to stay engaged. No
decisions were made in those groups, but they did a lot of brainstorming, research.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yep, they did homework for everybody.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Homework, that's a good way of saying it. And I was shocked, people
that were not very engaged in the beginning became much more engaged and they got to
participate.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It did. It was very interesting how people got involved, and then
they got involved in the issue they were most interested in. And so-- because I used to have three
of those.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: But another way maybe to think about keeping people engaged in
between, like I said, maybe that doesn't work. And it kind of naturally fell out in our group because
we just-- it was hard to accomplish so much as part of a bigger group, and so these groups naturally
formed, got together, had they met lots.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We did. [CHUCKLES]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So I don't know.

LYNN GUISSINGER: I think that's a great idea too, because coming in for whatever-- we'll be
there for three hours. Obviously, we hear more of it on board. But for them, it's sort of like, you
just give a little feedback, and the consultants go off and do a thing. So I think that's a good-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, like I said, I don't know if it worked, but-- I didn't mean to get
anymore work.
BILL VAN METER: Yeah, no.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: [LAUGHS]
PEGGY CATLIN: How much engagement are you getting off of that site?
JULIE SKEEN: We're getting quite a bit right now. We don't have a lot for people to react to, so
we've opened up. So we're getting just a lot of feedback. It's very broad feedback on what your
thoughts are, what your concerns are, what your suggestions are. But over the next couple months,
we're going to have a lot more to react to, when we can actually put out more in the spring, when
we actually have route maps and things for these different alternatives. That's really where that's
going to be a major source of outreach.
PEGGY CATLIN: Maybe those can be partitioned more of the interest areas so people can focus
on one area, or just a suggestion. Not make more work with it.
JULIE SKEEN: No, the website is designed to be-- little sections in and out, we can divide it up
in a lot of different ways, so that doesn't really get in the way.
PEGGY CATLIN: Right. I just didn't know what kind of interest.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, and I'm sharing with you that after the last meeting, people
were concerned about, wait a minute, that's not what I wanted to hear. So there was a disconnect
on their expectation as well. We talked about that. And I heard it both not just from the advisory
group and the people I was sitting around, but also got calls from the technical working group of
people going, whoa, wait a minute, this is-- why did we focus on this when this was clearly what
we wanted to talk about?
So I think that smaller working groups where people can delve into it would really be helpful so
they would feel engaged and could bring it to the whole group would be a way to do that as we
move forward as well.
JULIE SKEEN: And I do think a lot of that was related to this confusion between short-term and
long-term. We got a lot of discussions about climate change, for example, which is really a longer
term discussion, when we're focusing on the short-term. So that's something where we're taking it
has to talk about how to sever those pieces and be very clear to people.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well. And that's the other part-- yeah, small groups because
climate change has really bubbled to the top. And the city of Denver is really hitting it hard. And

I think-- yeah, but people are engaged in that right now, so they're seeing this as an extension of
that.
BRIAN WELCH: I just wanted to supplement a little bit of what Bill described between the System
Optimization Plan and the mobility plan for the future. And I'll give you two examples to see how,
while they're sequential, there's going to be quite a bit of overlap. One is this location-based
services work that we're going to present you with. We're going to learn a lot about travel markets.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Say it again, the vocation-based what?
BRIAN WELCH: Location-based services, that's the cell phone data that we have from millions
and millions of trips. The board will see a comparison between where we currently provide service
and where some of the key travel patterns are you will not be able to address all of those as part of
the System Optimization Plan, because that's really looking at a shorter term view.
However, you're going to be starting to think about, in the future plan, beyond, say 2021, where
are we headed? So those discussions will start, and we won't curtail them. But we'll need to say,
this is something that the board will pick up on.
Another example is you're going to be confronted with the cost per trip issue. And in a district like
ours, we've got some real challenges in terms of parts of our district that-- FlexRide has been
around for 20 years, but is FlexRide really the best way to do that for the mobility plan for the
future? We know that's going to come up. But what we'll tell people is that, yes, you have now
recognized something that the board knows. We'd like to figure out how to get the cost per trip
down. We probably can't do it next year, but we're definitely going to say, what's the future for
first and last mile for those shorter trips to get to our stations?
Again, that is going to come up, because the data will be right there in front of you. And you're
going to have to make some short-term decisions. And I don't think you're going to get rid of
FlexRide next year. But the mobility plan for the future may be something that's very different.
Who knows?
So there is some-- I mean, we're not going to make this strict, cut off, and say, don't talk about that
now. We'll just be kind of focusing our energy first to get to 2021 with the idea that there's going
to be a lot that's pointing us into the future by nature.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And the long-term is what, 2050?
BRIAN WELCH: Yeah. [CHUCKLES]
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Brian. The cell phone data, that will give us data on the commuting
population-- where they are, when they are, is that right?
BRIAN WELCH: All trips, yeah.

VINCE BUZEK: Because then we'll be able to determine where congestion is, where transit can
help with congestion, improve air quality, reduce that congestion.
BRIAN WELCH: That's right, yes. Cool.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And we'll be looking at where people are coming in from outside the
district too, I assume.
BRIAN WELCH: Yes, we've got a very large study area, so we're going way, way south, way
north, east and west.
VINCE BUZEK: Good.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, I think the good news is that everybody now has a
smartphone, everybody, every economic, whoever, everybody. For a long time, we were always
concerned that communities who were struggling couldn't afford cell phones, but now everybody
seems to have one. Yeah, so we're good there.
JULIE SKEEN: Well, there is something about above 65 and older. That is the only group that we
don't feel is necessarily as well represented with the cell phone data. So we are definitely going to
do some additional outreach and discussions around that population. But yeah, to your point lower
income, minority populations, absolutely everybody has got a cellphone.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
BILL VAN METER: So that's really it. Wanted to come back and have this sort of dialogue, get
some initial feedback from you as to what you're hearing, give you assurance that we are staying
the course and pushing hard and forward on this with those goals and that schedule, but working
on distinguishing more clearly between what the System Optimization Plan is and the mobility
plan for the future, and to even further kind of try to calm down some of the concerns that we've
heard.
We've heard from various stakeholders in confusion regarding what we're doing. We're going to
work on the same sort of messaging. We just spent a fair amount of time on, how do you boil that
down for various audiences so that they understand that we're doing both? There's a distinction,
and our focus right now is on the near-term/short-term mobility plan.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I think that perception might be that you guys are doing a lot of stuff, but
the stakeholders aren't seeing all that stuff that's going on. And so the momentum and maybe the
energy isn't perceived. So whatever can be communicated, just-HEATHER MCKILLOP: That might be good, because energy is really high internally, but we are
not getting that as a process.

PEGGY CATLIN: It's not being shown. It's not being demonstrated. I think that's a perception,
but it might lead to what to this point that they become engaged and then that second month. So I
think that's an issue.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Maybe that's just me.
BILL VAN METER: That's fair and accurate.
JULIE SKEEN: We have things that aren't necessarily ready for prime time yet, so that's part of
needing just a little bit more time to really start getting some exciting information that people can
react to. We're just not quite there yet, but that's because in the next months we will have a lot
more to show people.
PEGGY CATLIN: And we've been saying that. We know that you guys are really itching to get
this stuff done.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And we are too.
BILL VAN METER: We also don't want to distract you or stakeholders from service changes and
mid-February through early March, nor confuse it. So as I described, we've got three steps. We've
got May. And between now and March, that's where your focus is, appropriately. That's where our
stakeholders, our riders, our employees, everyone's focus is.
And if we start yammering about something that's coming later this year in the System
Optimization Plan, why are you guys trying to insert that into the conversation when this priority
is clear, first one? And we recognize that as well. And fortunately, it does work well in the timing.
Internally, staff, we're driving ahead. I'm pretty excited. We don't have that much to share yet.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you. Vince, did you have something?
VINCE BUZEK: I did, yeah. And I know this goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway.
[LAUGHS] The process of Reimagine and the System Optimization and mobility plan for the
future and the messaging behind it are critically important. And that's great, and I know that will
help build trust in our stakeholders, that they see that we're engaging in this appropriate process.
But obviously, delivering in what we decide to do is [LAUGHS] even bigger things. So make sure
we can have a plan that's deliverable.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I would just say, keep it simple, the messaging simple,
because short-term/long-term works more than System Optimization Plan.
BILL VAN METER: You don't like all those words moving?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, and people are really focused on specific things. And if you
can do them in specific buckets that people know, oh, this is going to impact the way our employees
feel. This is going to impact affordable housing. This is going to impact climate change, I think
that would be helpful for them in terms of being able to decipher what they want to participate in.

But they are confused and a little put out that, well, wait a minute, this is not what I signed up for.
So I think this sounds great.
BILL VAN METER: Cool. So I'll look forward to meeting with you and the other board members,
and we'll work back for themes and what we hear as well from those meetings.
PEGGY CATLIN: I spoke with Bill Sirois two days ago on the phone, and he wanted some dates.
Is he going to be out for a few days.
BILL VAN METER: I spoke with him today. He says he'll be back in the office tomorrow. It was
a hairline fracture, and he didn't need drugs, and his-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, well, that was this morning. [LAUGHS]
BILL VAN METER: And he's raring to get back in the office.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Is he in a boot?
BILL VAN METER: Is he?
JULIE SKEEN: He's in a boot, and he's got the little stroller.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Oh, gosh. [LAUGHTER]
So, he's got some mobility issues.
JULIE SKEEN: He is going to have mobility issues.
VINCE BUZEK: Like Director Folska says, you're either disabled or you're going to become
disabled.
[LAUGHTER]
LYNN GUISSINGER: She said that?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, thank you for coming.
BILL VAN METER: Thank you. Thanks for your time and attention.
BRIAN WELCH: Cool.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thanks so much. I have just one more agenda item to go over.
[SIDE CONVERSATION]
[DOOR CLOSES]

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Something to pass out to you guys. Thanks, Christina.
CHRISTINA ZAZUETAS: OK, guys.
PEGGY CATLIN: Madam Chair, could you-- Vince wanted to see that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No.
[LAUGHTER]
VINCE BUZEK: No?
PEGGY CATLIN: There are a couple of other ones, so we'll be passing this around, sustainability
and energy and transportation technology conference.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, good.
PEGGY CATLIN: And a conference on advancing transportation equity.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I thought I might share those with you.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Equity is one of your goals for 2020.
PEGGY CATLIN: So I've got-- there are a couple more that I'll share with you that we could-BARBARA MCMANUS: I'll copy them and hand them out.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I do have an update for you guys that's going to make you all sad,
and that is Streets Blog is closing down today because they don't have money. So I guess we don't
get to talk to them. Yeah. It was just announced.
VINCE BUZEK: Can we make a-- let's go do a GoFundMe or a bake sale.
[LAUGHTER]
DAVE GENOVA: So he had [INAUDIBLE], didn't he?
PEGGY CATLIN: I could donate a couple of smart cards.
VINCE BUZEK: I could donate something to what's his name I tell ya.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I just wanted to give you that sad news.

VINCE BUZEK: Closing? Streetsblog. You mean across the country or just here? Just here, Angie,
or across the country?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think it's just here.
PEGGY CATLIN: Did they send a text or something?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, Laurie Huff, said Streetsblog Denver is shutting down
today, money ran out.
VINCE BUZEK: What's Andy going to do? He could go work for The Enquirer or something.
[LAUGHTER]
Appropriate. Oh, it's were recording. Never mind, Angie.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, so we have one more agenda item I'd like to just share with
you to see how we're going to move forward, and that has to do about the plan for the general
council structure and search. So we also have that position coming open. And I wanted to touch
base with you to see what you think about that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: What's the typical? What have we done? How much is the national search
where we live?
DAVE GENOVA: Yeah, typically, what we've done is to do a natural search like we do for any
senior position. We don't hire-- we haven't typically hired a search firm to do those. We've just,
through HR, have done national recruitment. and we get pretty good activity on all of those. And
it's traditionally been a position the general manager has hired with input from the board. So the
last time we recruited the position, we had one board member sit on the interview panel.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And we will advertise. Because it's a specialty area, it helps us with the
advertisement, because it would to all the bars.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: To the bars, huh?
[LAUGHTER]
HEATHER MCKILLOP: May I clarify that on the record?
[LAUGHTER]
May I clarify that?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: The Bar Association.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, OK, got it. Thank you.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So has the American bar the Hispanic bar, the Women's bar, the-- yes,
I'm sorry. That did not come out properly. Not the bar staff. The non-drinker. So that, because it's
a specialty area, not only would we go in transit areas, but we would go to all the bar associations
too. And that lends itself to that pretty easily.
And I can tell you we've gotten lots of interest already. I know just by the sheer number of phone
calls I've gotten from people.
DAVE GENOVA: From when we originally posted?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes. Yeah. But that's how we would normally do it. We can do it
however you want.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that's a good process.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: The only thing, because I'm here, and you probably don't care what I
want to say here, but I would just advocate-- and Dave can follow up with this-- the longer you
have somebody in an acting position, the more internal strife it creates. So the sooner we can get
that position hired-- and I know there's all kinds of issues with the interim, and them doing the
hiring with the board, whatever you want to do, I would just say whatever we do, the sooner the
better, because we have had considerable angst when an acting person is acting for-PEGGY CATLIN: A long period of time?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, and the volume of work in that department minus one person is
really a consideration as well.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And the fact that we're going to court in May, one of the largest cases
we've ever dealt with. And I think that's why we were trying to get it done as quickly as possible.
LYNN GUISSINGER: How long do you advertise?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So we would typically do a position at that level and nationally probably
three to four weeks.
LYNN GUISSINGER: And then do the interviews and-HEATHER MCKILLOP: And then we would be working on getting those interviews scheduled
ahead of time to depending-- because typically, it'd be the GM and a board member, a higher level.
Then your calendars are booked a little bit more. So we would typically try to get those interviews
scheduled ahead of time, anticipating when it closed, how long it would take us to do the resume
review and those type of things.

DAVE GENOVA: The original plan was to do those this week, in the original recruitment that we
posted.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: We would've done it.
DAVE GENOVA: --get through that this week.
PEGGY CATLIN: Would it be premature to start the advertising process now, though, just
understanding the timeline?
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah, but coincide appropriately with a new interim coming in, on board.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, we can do that. I can work with our HR department in getting that
all laid out. And then I don't know if you saw the job description, but I can get Barbara-LYNN GUISSINGER: I'd like to see that.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And then you guys can see the job description before we send that out.
PEGGY CATLIN: You said you have that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, Barbara.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Like the general manager.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You have the general manager's.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I have the general counsel. I can send hers.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Shelly had some thoughts that probably draw in, and there was some
discussion of whether in other places, it's a job that reports to the board.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
DAVE GENOVA: I think it would be interesting for you to hear from Rolf, because there are some
issues when you have employees that report to the board, as opposed to reporting-- and that was
one of the reasons we changed a number of years ago, administratively, how Barbara's position
reports, because there is some liability risk there.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Oh, is that right?
DAVE GENOVA: Yes. And so I think it would be interesting for you to hear from Rolf to give
you a short description about that.

LYNN GUISSINGER: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But in the meantime, couldn't we go ahead and do the-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Start advertising?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --start advertising?
VINCE BUZEK: I think so.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And then could we maybe-- I don't know if this is the right
process, call a special executive committee meeting to meet with Rolf to talk about these specific
pieces?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I don't know we need a special meeting.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I can look. If we sit down with Rolf, I would like for everybody
to hear what he has to say about the process. So that's why I'm asking. That would be a special
meeting, right, when we have to call it because he would not be here?
PEGGY CATLIN: Transit agencies typically do have a general counsel.
DAVE GENOVA: You'll see all kinds of different things.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yeah, it's because a lot of transit agencies are county, so it's the county
attorney that represents. If they're associated with the state, it's the AG's office that does it.
Sometimes they report to the board. Sometimes they report to the GM. So I think you guys are just
going to have to decide what you feel is best for this organization, because I don't think you're
going to find a norm.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And is that in the job description, who it reports to and all of that?
DAVE GENOVA: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Vince.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah, and I know Shelley, and I come from a prior-elected city councils. And
that's how we always did. We hired our general manager and our counsel, so that instructs our bias,
I suppose, toward that kind of thing. So it'll be interesting to hear what Rolf has to say about
potential liabilities and all that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And were they both contract employees?
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.

DAVE GENOVA: OK. So that makes a difference too.
VINCE BUZEK: So they're both contract employees.
DAVE GENOVA: OK.
VINCE BUZEK: And the reported, we evaluated. We gave them their raises. We did everything .
LYNN GUISSINGER: With a contract. Is that what you're trying to say? Not a contracted
employee.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Not an employee.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: This would be an employee here, right?
DAVE GENOVA: And that's an important distinction, and that was one of the reasons we made
this change a number of years ago, because I'm the only-PEGGY CATLIN: Because you had one contracted employee reporting to another contracted
employee, which-HEATHER MCKILLOP: Well, I think the issue is if they report directly to the board. Right now,
we only have one person under a contract, and that's our GM. All right, our general counsel is
considered an employee, non-contracted. So they fall under all the-PEGGY CATLIN: OK, my personal experience with RTD, having dealt with Marla for many
years, and which I loved.
[LAUGHTER]
I did, got a lot done.
VINCE BUZEK: You always knew where she was coming from.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: I got a lot done.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: And she could be persuaded.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: But anyway, but I think there's something to be said for some continuity to
command a new contract right now. Or a contract might not. And who is the general manager?

LYNN GUISSINGER: There's some confusion here because they're either a contractor or-- you're
still an employee. You just have a of contract. You're not under full hire.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: --all kinds of employment rules that we employ-LYNN GUISSINGER: He has to abide by his contract guidelines.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: But currently, Rolf falls under the employment rules of RTD.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Work for hire.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right, he works for RTD.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And we're still all at at-will. It's just a whole different set of employment
rules that apply to us, liability, and what we're covered as an employee versus a contractor.
PEGGY CATLIN: But I would like to understand the liability of the whole agency, which is really- that's huge. And then there is some liability associated with the board. So he advises us on them.
But I think when you look at the risks, it seems to me that having an attorney as an RTD employee
would be-LYNN GUISSINGER: They're still an employee.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So it's not like they're an independent contractor. It's just whether they-- I
think there's some confusion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I do too, because what I heard from people was, could we
have an attorney for the board? That was-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
LYNN GUISSINGER: Whether respond to them, reply to the she, or whoever who is inquired.
DAVE GENOVA: So now there's a dotted line relationship.
PEGGY CATLIN: Which is-- let's make it a double dotted relationship.
[LAUGHTER]
BARBARA MCMANUS: And in the past, if the board decided that they needed outside counsel,
we went out to RFP and got an outside counsel for that period of time. And I have money in my
budget for that. So maybe that lumps in the decision-making as well.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So that might change the dialogue, do you think, which you and
Shelley?
VINCE BUZEK: No, I don't, but I appreciate it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, then I'm wondering if I could set up a meeting with maybe
you and Shelley and Rolf?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Well I'll come to that too. More like seven executives were supposed to
meet.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think we should all sit in.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Attach it to something else.
DAVE GENOVA: I think it'd be good to hear from Rolf.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I do too. I think we should bring him in and let's all meet and talk
about it. I know you guys have to.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: OK, I'll have her send out and give you guys like a week or something
to respond to any input, and then we'll wait for your direction to advertise it. And we could leave
that mushy.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I thought we were going to go ahead and advertise.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah, but we need to get that defined, whether it's, yeah.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Or we can just leave it mushy and says that it has a relationship with
both the board and the GM.
PEGGY CATLIN: A reporting relationship with the GM.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: And not say specifically the direct.
PEGGY CATLIN: You need to move to adjourn?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We need to move to adjourn.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So move.
VINCE BUZEK: So move returned. Second.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Second.
VINCE BUZEK: Third.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All in favor?
VINCE BUZEK: Aye.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Aye.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: He's calling board members today about the executive search.
