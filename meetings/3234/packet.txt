BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Approval of Bridge Inspections On-Call Services Contract
Change

Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to increase the oncall bridge inspection contract with Alfred Benesch & Co. by $600,000 for a total amount not to exceed
$2,160,900.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry J. Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD contracts for inspection services for all its 109 bridges, including light rail, pedestrian, commuter
rail and Amtrak bridges; as well as 14 freight rail bridges along the Southwest Corridor through
agreements made with the railroads during construction.
The current on-call bridge inspection contract is held by Alfred Benesch and Co. (Benesch) which was
awarded on August 25, 2017. The initial contract was for three years, plus two, one-year options. All
the options have been exercised. The current contract is set to expire on August 25, 2022, at which
time staff will solicit proposals for bridge inspection services. Over the five-year contract span, three
new rail corridors opened and required inclusion in the agency’s bridge inspection program. Thus, the
original contract value will be exceeded before the inspections are completed.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the contract value be increased at this time, which will allow Benesch to perform
the 2022 bridge inspections, prior to the contract expiration date. This will allow continuity of
inspections and processes under the current program.
Staff is currently updating the current bridge management program for compliance with recent Safety
Management System and Transit Asset Management requirements. These additional requirements
would be ready for inclusion into RTD’s bridge management program in the second quarter of 2022.
Contingent upon completion of the bridge management program, staff anticipates soliciting for a fiveyear inspection contract.
FINANCIAL AND OTHER IMPACTS
Bridge inspections are budgeted annually as an operating expense line item. Funding for this contract
change will be included within the expense budget request for 2022.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
29th and Welton Property Disposition

Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and/or her designee to negotiate and
execute all documents necessary for the disposition by lease or sale of the real property located at
2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver, Colorado (the “Property”), including execution of any deeds,
covenants, and other property conveyance documents.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Transit-Oriented Development Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the Equitable Transit-Oriented Development (eTOD) Policy, approved by the Board
in February 2021, as well as the policy goals of Resolution 17, Series of 2010, the Strategic Plan for
Transit-Oriented Development, by supporting creation of mixed-income housing near transit stations.
RTD acquired the Property located at the corner of 29th Street and Welton Street for $97,000 in 1993
to replace the on-street parking for local businesses that was lost during the construction of the Central
Corridor. The Property is currently a vacant parking lot used for neighborhood retail parking and is not
managed as part of RTD’s parking management system.
In 2010, the Board adopted the Strategic Plan for TOD to create a more focused policy that guides
RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. The Board also
approved the TOD Pilot Program to test implementation of the new Strategic Plan for TOD. Pursuant to
that policy direction, RTD selected the Welton Corridor as one of four Pilot Program sites because of a
combination of favorable market conditions for redevelopment and the City and County of Denver’s
(CCD) commitment to revitalization of the Welton Corridor, a commitment that continues today.
In 2013, the Five Points Business District published its Vision Plan Implementation & Revitalization
Strategy, which called for removal of vacant parking lots along the corridor, including activation of the
Property. The plan emphasized the need to retain housing affordability in the Welton Corridor.
Beginning in 2014, RTD staff and the Denver Office of Economic Development (OED) began discussions
around how to partner to implement the community vision established in the Five Points Business
District plan as part of the RTD Pilot Program implementation. CCD determined that attainable for-sale
housing was the preferred strategy for the site.
In December 2016, the Board approved an option agreement for CCD or its assignee to purchase the
Property at fair market value, for the development of mixed-income housing. The exercise of the option
was contingent on the mutual selection of a development partner. A developer was selected in
December 2017 but could not secure adequate financing, prompting RTD and CCD to dismiss the

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

developer and the project in January 2020 prior to closing. Later in 2020, the Board affirmed its
preference to ground-lease, rather than sell, this property for redevelopment. The Property was appraised
in January 2020 at $2.4 million. In 2021, the Board approved a resolution committed to promoting
affordable housing as detailed in the agency’s eTOD Policy.
RTD and CCD have outlined a competitive process to solicit developers to build a mixed-income
condominium project with affordable units on the Property. RTD would lead the Request for
Qualifications (RFQ) process and CCD would participate in the developer selection panel and provide gap
financing for the project. A letter from Denver Mayor Michael Hancock expressing CCD’s commitment to
this project is attached to the Board packet. It describes CCD’s willingness to contribute substantial gap
financing to support an appropriate development on the Property.
To aid in the successful completion of the developer selection, RTD must establish certainty for potential
bidders that the property will be available at previously agreed upon terms. Therefore, staff has
requested authority to dispose of the Property according to the terms below.
DISCUSSION
This action would give authority to dispose of the Property to the selected developer conditioned upon
meeting the following requirements:
1. RTD will successfully procure a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium
project with affordable units.
2. The selected developer will secure the financing necessary to complete the project.
3. The final lease or purchase price for the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of
the Property with a potential for reductions in purchase price or rent in exchange for affordable
housing development or other benefits to the agency pursuant to the eTOD Policy.
4. Lease signing or closing will occur a maximum of two years from the date of developer selection,
with the ability to grant two 90-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction.
5. RTD will grant property rights to the development partner via a ground lease rather than a sale
unless a ground lease structure is financially infeasible; or if a sale structure substantially
increases the quantity, depth, or length of the term of affordability; or a sale structure is
financially beneficial to RTD, as determined by RTD.
If a selected developer fails to complete the transaction, RTD would remain the property owner and any
subsequent decisions about the Property would be subject to Board approval. RTD staff will keep the
Board apprised of the developer selection process and project implementation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,500 per year maintaining the property. If the property is
disposed of, RTD will no longer have this maintenance obligation and will receive the amount determined
by a fair market value appraisal of the Property.

Board of Directors

To the RTD Board of Directors:
This letter is to express the City and County of Denver’s strong and enthusiastic support for the
proposal before you to approve the disposition of RTD-owned property at 2907-2915 Welton
Street for the development of mixed-income housing.
Since the fall of 2014, Denver’s Office of Economic Development (OED) and now the office of
Housing Stability (HOST) has been working closely with the RTD Transit-Oriented
Development team to plan for the development of mixed-income for-sale housing on this
site. We look forward to continuing to collaborate on this joint effort to provide critical
affordable homeownership opportunities in the Five Pointsneighborhood.
As part of HOST’s mission, we invest federal and local funds in the development and
preservation of a variety of income-qualified housing throughout the city. Each year, HOST
invests millions of dollars of gap financing in non-profit and private-sector-led development
projects that add to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
Housing costs in the Denver region are rising out of reach for even moderate-income residents,
with an estimated 100,000 households in Denver County alone paying more than 30% of their
income for housing costs. We recognize the need to invest in affordable housing options not
only to provide shelter for our region’s most vulnerable residents, but also to support the
economic mobility of Denver’s low- and moderate-income families as they become ready to
move into homeownership. To achieve this goal, HOST invests in affordable housing units
ranging from supportive housing for the lowest-income residents to for-sale units for
households earning up to the median income.

Michael B. Hancock

Due partly to construction defects restrictions, very few for-sale units have been built in Denver
over the last several years, limiting the entry-level housing options available to lower- and
moderate-income homebuyers. The city is eager to continue to collaborate with RTD and a
mutually selected developer to pilot on this site a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction at this location. We are prepared to contribute substantial gap financing to an
appropriate development on this site to support this effort.
We look forward to the opportunity to continue to deepen and strengthen our relationship
with RTD as a key partner in innovative development throughout Denver.
Respectfully,

Michael B. Hancock

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail, RTD and
CDOT Commission Cooperation Agreement

Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to execute the Cooperation
Agreement between Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger Rail Commission and Regional
Transportation District and Colorado Department of Transportation for Accomplishment of Shared Goals
(Cooperation Agreement).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
William C. Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In a February 2021 meeting with the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Southwest Chief and Front Range
Passenger Rail Commission (Commission), the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) raised the possibility
of entering into an agreement between RTD and the Commission.
As discussed, the agreement would formalize the intent of both parties to work collaboratively in the
preliminary operations planning and related activities, including outreach and design, for passenger rail
service along the Northwest Rail Alignment in concert with the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study.
Subsequent discussions with the Commission and the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT)
led to mutual agreement to add CDOT as a signatory to the agreement as CDOT has an established
working relationship providing staff time in support of the Commission.
Through March and April 2021, staff from the three parties collaborated in the preparation of a draft
Cooperation Agreement and on April 22, 2021, the GM/CEO provided the Board a first draft of the
proposed Cooperation Agreement for review and comment. The Commission and CDOT have also had
the opportunity to review and provide input throughout the development process.
Concurrently, the Commission and CDOT have been jointly pursuing development of a scope of work for
a federal grant-funded Service Development Plan (SDP) for Front Range passenger rail, with the
Northwest Rail Corridor identified as one potential alignment in the northern Denver metro area. The SDP
will outline a business plan, operating plan, and capital plan and investment case for a proposed
Passenger Rail service. This includes an evaluation of operation feasibility, financial feasibility and overall
value and merit of the proposed service.
On June 30, 2021, Governor Polis signed Senate Bill 21-238, creating the Front Range Passenger Rail
District (District). Per this legislation, the Commission will be terminated effective February 15, 2022
with the District effectively acting as the successor to the Commission. The District will hold its first
meeting no later than May 15, 2022.

Packet Pg. 18

1.B.3

The District was created for the purpose of planning, designing, developing, financing, constructing,
operating and maintaining a passenger rail system. The District is also authorized to exercise powers
related to these purposes, including the ability to propose taxes, subject to voter approval, to fund a
front range passenger rail system.
Following review, edits and comment resolution by representatives of the legal teams for RTD and
CDOT, the Cooperation Agreement is ready for Board consideration and execution.
DISCUSSION
The Cooperation Agreement formalizes a cooperative partnership on behalf of the parties to work
towards completing a unified, single preliminary operations plan for passenger rail service along the
Northwest Rail Alignment, consistent with the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study and the
Commission/CDOT-sponsored Front Range Service Development Plan. The Cooperation Agreement
identifies opportunities for cooperation in planning, stakeholder engagement and public involvement,
media relations, legislative and policy development, budget and funding, staffing and oversight and
management.
Although the Commission will be superseded in early 2022 by the District, all parties agree in principle
that the execution of this Cooperation Agreement will be of value in the interim. Additionally, the
cooperation agreement sets a strong template for a potential future agreement between RTD, CDOT and
the District, which is also consistent with the intent of Senate Bill 21-238, in that the bill specifically
requires the District to work collaboratively with RTD to ensure interconnectivity with any passenger rail
system operated by or for RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021

Colfax Bus Rapid Transit

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brian T. Welch, Senior Manager, Planning Technical Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The City and County of Denver (CCD) is preparing to initiate the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
Small Starts Capital Improvement Grant (CIG) process for its Colfax Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project.
CCD has requested that RTD act as the direct recipient of FTA capital funding for the project, minimally
for the project development phase, as CCD itself cannot receive the funding directly.
Over the past few years, RTD has engaged in multiple discussions with the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG), Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the FTA regarding the BRT
project and has consistently expressed its willingness to act as the direct recipient of CIG project dollars,
although not unconditionally. During these discussions, RTD has communicated that the agency’s
financial obligations must focus on continued revenue hours of service. The agency has not committed
to financial participation in construction or maintenance of new facilities.
DISCUSSION
As CCD is not a direct recipient of FTA grants at this time, RTD will serve as the sponsoring agency
with the FTA and will undertake work in pursuit of FTA funding for the project, with an application to
enter Small Starts Project Development. RTD will submit grant application(s) to the FTA, with agreement
from CCD, for project implementation needs and will agree to pass through to CCD any FTA grant funds
awarded for the project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There are no financial impacts.

Common Questions: Col-FAQs
How were station locations identified?
The East Colfax BRT project developed preferred BRT station locations as part of
the Alternatives Analysis. These locations are viewed as crucial to the success of the
project. However, through the Alternatives Analysis process, as well as for the East and
East Central Neighborhood Planning Initiative (NPI) efforts, a few locations/areas have
been identified for consideration for future station changes/additions. They include:
•

•
•
•

Replacing Steele. St. Station with two stations at 1/3 mile spacing between
York/Josephine and Colorado, specifically at Fillmore and Madison
Adding a station east of Colorado, specifically at Cherry
Adding a station east of Quebec, specifically at Syracuse
Connecting service to Denver Union Station

The current preliminary engineering and environmental phase will incorporate these
changes into the design process and identify the final station locations.

Common Questions: Col-FAQs
Has the pandemic changed plans for Colfax BRT?
Simply put, no. Over 75% of Denver voters overwhelmingly approved $55 million infunding for Colfax BRT in the
2017 Denver Transportation and Mobility System Bonds.

Ridership on the 15/15L remained extraordinarily high throughout the pandemic, dropping by only 39% (over
12,000 people per day compared to over 20,000 pre-pandemic). This made Colfax one of the strongest
performing transit corridors in the country during COVID. Nationally, transit ridership in 2020 dropped by 79% on
average compared to 2019 levels.

What have you been doing for the past several years and why is it taking so long?
Certainly, there was a longer than anticipated gap between the prior planning work for center-running BRT on
Colfax and the current process. With a project of this size and scope there is always a significant amount of interagency coordination and planning involved…and the global pandemic did not do our schedule any favors.
The good news is that a process and schedule is now in place to take us through:
• Preliminary engineering and environmental clearance by the end of 2022
• Final design by 2024 with construction starting as early as 2026
• BRT service operating by 2028

How will dedicated transit lanes on Colfax help regional mobility?
The corridor is one of Denver’s busiest transportation networks for all modes of travel, especially transit. The
bus routes serving East Colfax have the highest ridership of all RTD routes - more than 20,000 riders per
weekday. Current bus service in the corridor is near capacity and even small service interruptions can result in
passengers being left at stops to wait for the next bus.
The City is moving forward with BRT on Colfax because doing nothing is not an option. Over the next 20 years,
the corridor is expected to experience 25% growth in the number of travelers, 67% growth in employment and
25% growth in population. Denver cannot continue to grow and create more people-friendly spaces without
efficiently moving more people through the East Colfax corridor.

How will dedicated transit lanes on Colfax affect traffic on adjacent streets?
Traffic data shows that congestion and diversion to adjacent streets occurs today and, unfortunately, will only
increase with or without the project. Investing in Colfax BRT allows us to better manage those existing
challenges and meet future demands by:
• Creating the capacity to move more people more efficiently through the same amount of space
• Facilitating a shift from vehicles to transit due to improved travel times, reliability and convenience
• Addressing diversion to adjacent streets with a number of operational and safety improvements
As our city continues to grow and evolve, doing nothing to address congestion and traffic diversion isn’t a viable
option. With Colfax BRT, more people utilizing transit means fewer vehicles on the road, fewer emissions and
less congestion along Colfax and parallel streets.

This demonstration of Colfax’s ability to equitably serve our essential frontline workforce and transit dependent
population has only further proven why Colfax is a perfect candidate for BRT.

1.C.1.b

Common Questions: Col-FAQs
What Happens to the 15L Enhanced Stops being installed now?
• The stops are constructed in a way that makes the shelters easily maintainable, and repairable, which also
makes them easy to move.
• There is no proposal to change or move the shelters east of Yosemite, in the Aurora portion of the corridor
because Aurora prefers to keep the service side-running
• Denver has additional corridors being improved, so the shelters between Broadway and Yosemite can be
re-positioned on another corridor. A specific corridor has not been identified at this time, but should be
identified over the next few years prior to the BRT being constructed.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
RTD Board Redistricting Process

Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to CRS 32-9-111 (1)(a), following each federal decennial census, the RTD Board of Directors
“… apportion the composition of the Board into compact and contiguous director districts so that the
fifteen directors will represent, to the extent practical, the people of the district on the basis of
population."
This redistricting must be completed before March 15 of the second year following the year in which the
federal census is taken. The approval of the redistricting requires a two-thirds majority of the full Board.
If this deadline is not met, the Colorado Legislative Council, with assistance from the Director of
Research of the Legislative Council and the Director of the Office of Legislative Legal Services, must
oversee the redistricting.
DISCUSSION
Following the recent completion of the 2020 decennial census, RTD has engaged the consultant services
of Farnsworth Group to assist with the preparation of the redistricting map for the Board's review,
comments, and approval. On July 7, 2021, Chair Angie Rivera-Malpiede appointed Directors Broom and
Whitmore to the Redistricting Ad Hoc Committee to coordinate with staff and the consultant to review
alternatives and to recommend to the full Board a new Director District map.
The Redistricting Ad Hoc Committee is scheduled to begin meeting in September 2021 and solicit input
from each Director.
The general guidelines for preparation of these alternatives will include the following parameters:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Redistricting map must be adopted by the Board before March 15, 2022
Districts must be comprised of whole voter precincts (required by statute)
All current Directors remain in their existing Districts following the adjustment of boundary lines
Plus, or minus five percent deviation from the average population variation between Districts
Jurisdictional lines must be followed when possible
Irregular boundary lines should be avoided
