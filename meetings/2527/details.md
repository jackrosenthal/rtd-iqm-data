There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Planning Department

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, said General Manager Genova wanted this update so that the Board could be informed on the key activities for the Planning Department.  He added that Bill Sirois and Brian Welch will assist him with the presentation tonight.

Brian Welch, Senior Manager of Planning and Technical Services, stated that the Southeast Rail Extension was the first project accepted into the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) New Starts Project Development in 2013.  He remarked that the SE extension moved into New Starts Engineering in 2015, and reauthorization of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act expedited approvals, resulting in a one-time $92 million grant in April of this year.

Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Communities, commented that an independent consultant came in and performed a system wide assessment of RTD’s Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and made recommendations for moving forward.  He added that staff has been working on the recommendations in various forms over the past several months.  He noted that staff completed the North Area Transit Study (NATE) earlier this summer and recommendations include a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) alignment from Brighton to the University of Colorado A line.  He remarked that the completion of this study allows local jurisdictions to plan for the future and to reserve right-of-way.

Brian Welch remarked that another item staff has been working on is documentation for Congress regarding new starts.  He stated that the After Study for the W line, and Before Study for the University of Colorado A line are underway and commented that the purpose of the studies are to document actual outcomes and monitor the accuracy of predicted outcomes for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).

Bill Sirois commented that the SH 119 BRT Budget Transfer was tabled at last month’s Board Meeting, but staff is hopeful that the Board will approve the transfer later this month.  He stated staff has been working with the City of Longmont to come up with a mutually agreed upon concept.

Bill Van Meter stated RTD pursued multiple discretionary grants in 2016 and noted there is an application that is currently under review.  He added that RTD helped the City and County of Denver with their Smart City Application, and although it wasn’t successful, it did open the door to other programs.

Bill Van Meter stated RTD is looking to improve the Pass Program Study to better serve our customers.  He noted that staff wants to revisit and refine the individual pass program goals, refine the pricing and administration of each pass program and eventually recommend policy revisions to the Board for adoption.

Bill Van Meter commented that staffs other planning efforts include:

- Denveright process

- Colfax Connections

- State Hwy 7 BRT

- Speer/Leetsdale Plan

- National Organization of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) South Broadway Transit Accelerator Demonstration Project

- Rail~Volution 2017 Planning

- Interregional Connectivity Study

Bill Van Meter added that internally, staff is also working to identify and eliminate waste while providing tools to innovate.  The Continuous Improvement Implementation is a strategic commitment plan to attract and retain a dynamic workforce to improve communication and collaboration.

Committee Chair James thanked staff and commented that this was a lot of information.

Chair Tobiassen noted one of the challenges for FasTracks was overmatching.  He asked staff to explain what exactly overmatching is, and what makes it difficult.

Brian Welch explained that in 1989, the FTA introduced an initiative to encourage local transit agencies to provide a greater local share for capital projects.  Known as overmatch, this larger local share was expected to result in greater local flexibility in transit planning and additional consideration in Federal review and decisions for capital project approvals.  He stated that on Small Starts projects, the Federal Government will pay up to 80%, but that makes the local commitment of 20% or more much higher than it has been previously.  He added that Federal funds are extremely competitive because projects that require fewer Federal dollars with a higher local overmatch percentage are usually granted the funds they need.

Chair Tobiassen commented that funds are limited because regions are contributing more than the required 20% to be competitive.

Committee Chair James asked how much the local match was for the SE rail extension.  Brian Welch indicated the local match was 60%.

Director Bagley indicated he had sent General Manager Genova an email last month discussing the new zoning for the City and County of Denver.  He said the entire Platte Facility was re-zoned and asked staff to come back at the next committee meeting with a report on what is being proposed.  Bill Sirois commented that RTD staff had not been engaged with the City or County regarding any re-zoning of RTD property.  General Manager Genova added that what Director Bagley is referring to might be a concept, but staff will research this item.

Director Francone noted she did not see any mention of Jefferson County.  She indicted all of the plans seemed to only include Denver or Denver County.  She asked for a discussion off-line about Jefferson County plans, and inquired about the Funding Advancements for Surface Transportation and Economic Recovery Act (FASTER) Funds use.

Bill Van Meter stated that CDOT has a very well defined criterion as to how FASTER funds are allocated.  He added that RTD has always aligned projects with CDOT’s priorities.

Director Francone asked if RTD has considered monetizing the innovations that have come out of the Process Improvement Process.  Bill Van Meter stated it is difficult to quantify a dollar amount, but it is on staff’s radar.

Director Anderson said this is an excellent conversation that a former finance manager at CDOT used to have about the color of money.  She noted it is important for the Board to understand the transportation planning process from the bottom up.  She said it begins with the city planners and commissioners who decide what a city’s transportation needs are.  She added that all she is hearing is that funds are becoming more and more competitive and Board members need to work within their own communities because that is where it starts.  She stated the Board needs to understand how the money flows, where it comes from, what it is for, and where it goes to.

Director Sisk stated that RTD has committed to hosting Rail~Volution next year.  He said this is a tremendous opportunity, but if any Directors have concerns, they need to be flushed out early.  Secondly, he stated he is concerned with the current budget constraints and remarked that the Pass Program needs to be integrated with the rest of the budget.  He remarked that the Board and Staff needs to focus on the current economic situation as it appears it is not going to change drastically.

Director Menten asked what RTD is looking to spend to host Rail~Volution and requested that staff follow up with her off-line.

Committee Chair James inquired about what opportunities have been done to provide the local match that would make the central rail extension occur.  He also asked about the acquisition of Burnham Yard, and contemplated if Value Capture could assist with those two projects.

Bill Van Meter explained that the Central Rail Extension has been discussed extensively, but in terms of Burnham Yard, staff has not had the chance to review property values or other opportunities.

General Manager Genova stated that with the current status of RTD’s financial condition, the cost associated with that kind of movement does not fit in the current financial plan.

Committee Chair James remarked that RTD is cash short, but land rich and encouraged staff to broaden their thinking in order to find other opportunities.

Director Bagley commented that he supports Value Capture and stated it is an option to enhance funds to the corridors that need to be completed.  He added that Value Capture should be studied as a much more possible opportunity than previously considered.
