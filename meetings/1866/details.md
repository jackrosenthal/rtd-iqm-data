#### 1. I-225 Rail Line Fitzsimons Alignment Update

Chuck Culig, I-225 Engineering Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the January 7, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Tobiassen mentioned that Directors Deadwyler, Folska and he pretty much live and breathe this project every day since they live in the I-225 corridor.  He thanked Cuck Culig and his entire team for the great job they do.  He informed the Board that the PI and Construction teams are out more than twice a week briefing different organizations, committees, etc.  Director Tobiassen reiterated his thanks to the I-225 team for all their hard work and great progress.  He stated that it is no small task to keep everyone informed about what is going on and he really appreciates what they are doing.

Chair Sisk stated that it is incredible what has taken place; however, he noticed that missing from the presentation was information about the continuing of our conversation with the University of Colorado.  He commented that there were many questions brought up by the Board when the decision was made to change the alignment.  He hopes that RTD is engaging with them on a regular basis because he believes it is critical for them to be involved, especially in terms of the transportation they are providing from the train to campus.  General Manager Washington stated that CU President Bruce Benson is thoroughly engaged in this project.  He shared with the Board that he met with Mr. Benson several times since the new alignment was approved.  General Manager Washington said that CU is looking at preliminary information and data on the shuttle service and are committed to providing it.  He reiterated that CU is heavily involved from the top down.

Director Walker noted that in looking at the walkable area around Fitzsimons Station it is easy to see how the street pattern can cut off people who could be a 5 or 10 minute walk from the station.  He thought it may be something to look at how those people can make the connection since it is not beyond the realm of a reasonable walk.  Director Walker commented that he is also not a fan of screening.  He believes it is hard to maintain so he asked staff to consider other options.

Committee Chair Hoy asked the following questions:

1)      He noted there was a lot of controversy when the alignment change was made because of the need to remain on-time and on-budget.  He asked if this has delayed the completion date.  Chuck Culig stated that at this time it has not.

2)      He commented that the contractor is responsible for the land acquisition for this project.  He wondered if we are on schedule with acquisitions.  Chuck Culig stated that acquisitions are on schedule.

3)      He asked if the flood plane would require a concrete land bridge.  Chuck Culig said no.

4)      He commented that Chuck Culig said the background noise level was 50 decibels in the area.  He asked how the additional 40 decibels from the train would affect the background noise.  Chuck Culig said that the noise just disappears; it has no affect nor does it raise the level of background noise.

##### a. I-225 Fitz Board Meeting 1 07 14

### C. Other Matters

General Manager Washington reminded the Board that several weeks ago he informed them of the departure of Jim Starling, Project Manager for North Metro.  He said that since then RTD has gone through the recruitment and interview process and has selected Ashland Vaughn to be the new North Metro Project Manager.  General Manager Washington shared with the Board that Ashland was working on the Eagle P3 project and goes all the way back to T-Rex.  He noted that while Mr. Starling leaves big shoes to fill General Manager feels confident Mr. Vaughn will be able to.

Committee Chair Hoy stated that he was glad to hear the position has been filled.  He recognized that a lot of consideration was given to the choice and shared that he has heard great things about Mr. Vaughn.

### E. Adjourn

Committee Chair Hoy adjourned the meeting at 7:37 p.m.
