### 1. Citizens Advisory Committee Update

There was no CAC Update.  Chair Cohen reminded the Board members that the Annual Get Together with the CAC will be on December 19th.

### 1. Moving Forward: Filling the FasTracks Internal Savings Account

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Any funding realized through these activities will be tracked separately and added to a new budget account, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). The status of the FISA will be reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly basis, and the FISA will be incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan and Annual Budget. Expenditures from the FISA will be subject to Board approval, with the staff recommended project goals identified below in the Background section of this report confirmed as the current RTD Board project goals for the FISA.

Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:

Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system operations at the rate of inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI):
- Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;

Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction milestones have been reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant funding has been received and RTD has better information on the growth of sales and use tax:
- Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;

Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from three to two months:
- Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;

Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation – complete once funding is identified for the entire project:
- Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;

Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under contract:
- Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;

Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
- Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;

Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current level of 2.5%:
- Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;

Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and provide RTD with parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure exemptions are the same for both RTD and the State in all cases). Establish this as RTD’s number one legislative priority. Begin working immediately with government relations staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to initiate and support the introduction of a bill(s) on these topics during the 2013 legislative session:
- Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the FasTracks capital program through the establishment of the FISA with a goal of achieving $300 million by 2017. It is anticipated that these eight highest priority opportunities alone could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million by 2017. The Board directs staff to continue working to identify other funding opportunities through the RAM analysis process in 2013 for potential Board consideration at a later date.

Motion:               Director Malpiede made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 18th, 2012 Board meeting.

Director O’Boyle seconded the motion.

Discussion:              General Manager Phil Washington stated that he had asked staff to review these items with each Board member and that the most frequently asked questions have been addressed in the presentation that is part of the packet.  He stated that in November staff presented the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the RAM. For each of these opportunities, staff identified an estimated contribution to the FISA by 2017 and a level of risk.

Director Tayer complimented the staff for another great implementation plan and for taking the time to walk him through the list.  He wants to confirm that the funding of this initiative will not have any impact on the frequency of services for US-36 BRT.  Staff stated that for all FasTracks programs for both rail and bus rapid transit and the downtown circulator they have identified funding for all the operations and maintenance and there is not impact to rubber-tire allocation or steel wheel allocation.  This remains in the budget including US-36.

With regard to the 2.5% match, Director Tayer also asked if there are any expectations that the staff would prioritize or give favoritism to corridors based on that contribution.  Bill Van Meter stated that the Board adopted FasTracks plan establishes the 2.5% match and that’s the only enforceable expectation.   He does not anticipate any prioritization by the staff as that would be a Board decision.  Rick Clarke stated that financing is tight and any outside money will help, however that would be voluntary and that’s why we can’t count on it.  T-Rex is a good example; 30 million in cash came from the community.   Communities are willing to participate in order to get those lines in their area.  But the money could help move those corridors faster.  Based on the support and responses from the staff, Director Tayer stated that he will support the RAM.

Director Bagley asked GM Washington if based on Patton Boggs report, and if sequestration happens, would this money be used for the Eagle P3 project since this is the number one project.  GM Washington stated that there are some contingencies outside this process that can be used to cover if there is a shortfall.  That’s part of the reserves on the FasTracks side are for.  Staff feels confident that they will able to continue if there is a shortfall.

On item four “Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation – complete once funding is identified for the entire project”,  Director Bagley mentioned that when the $305 million fund was made available because of the savings for the Eagle P3 project, there was $90 million for the I-225 corridor, $90 million for the BRT to Boulder, $90 for the North Metro, $10 for the Southeast Corridor for different activities, $9 million for the Southwest corridor for the relocation of the Union Pacific railroad tracks, and about $1 million for the Central corridor.  He stated that that is what was stated from those corridors as to how the money would be allocated.  He has talked to Rick Clarke and they had agreed that they would go to the communities in the Southwest corridor and explain this.  He understands that until the construction of the Southwest corridor is fully funded, it is not viable to use the $9 million.  He wants a commitment from the staff that they will explain this to the Southwest area communities including the extension through Littleton from Mineral down to C-470 and Lucent, the Highlands Ranch Community Association, Highlands Ranch Metro District, the Highlands Ranch Chamber of Commerce as well as the South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce and the Denver South Economic Development Partnership so they understand what we are doing.  He will support this initiative with the understanding that this communication will take place.  GM Washington stated that the staff will go and explain that and reinstate the quarterly meeting with all the corridors.  He wants to make sure they understand that the deferral of the relocation does not negatively affect the construction of that extension.  He also mentioned that he had met with the VP of Union Pacific today and does not believe that the provisions of this initiative will change from the perspective of the railroad.   Director Bagley stated that he will participate in the outreach to the community.

Director Hoy thanked Director Bagley for his statement and appreciate that he is looking to the big picture.  With regard to project underruns he asked if there are funds available at the end of the projects such as I-225 and P3, will this go to this fund.  GM Washington sated that they will look at funds from all small and big FasTracks project and will present that to the Board and ask for a decision about the funds going into the internal savings account.

Director Hoy also asked if there has been any consideration to put the million dollars a year derived from turning Denver Union Station (DUS) over to our partners.   GM Washington explained that in lieu of that being a Base System project they would have to look at that and also take into consideration that there are some federal requirements in terms of what is left.  Again, these items would be brought to the Board for decision.

Director Hoy said that on the sales tax he is not clear which level it would be.  He asked if we would be auditing the state books on what is being collected and given to RTD.  Another aspect is to audit if they are correctly collecting the money from the businesses, or auditing the businesses and see if they are collecting and paying the proper amounts of taxes to the state.  Terry Howerter stated that those are the different levels; however the first thing is to get through the confidentiality agreement that will allow RTD to share the data received from the State with a third party or bring it in-house and do the data mining and then identify what the next steps are.  We would probably have to start with our records to compare with what the state has and look for any discrepancies and make the necessary adjustments between the state records and RTD’s.  If we could get self-collection it would take out the allocation risk; however, it has come back strongly that it would not pass through legislation.  The first step will be deciding how RTD will audit the data, in-house or through a third party or send it back to the State.   RTD pays the state for that service, but at this point we don’t know what they audit or what the results are.

Director Hoy asked if with regard to auditing the vendor, will we be going into the vendor and checking their record to see if they paid the proper taxes.  Terry Howerter affirmed that it would be just like what the State or cities do.   Director Hoy also asked about the estimated amount derived from this, which seems like it has not been defined.  Terry Howerter stated that from the $127 million there is $23-24 million that goes to parity and they want to have parity with the State.  The second part is going to the collection period where we will see and improvement in the audit and so the first year we might pick up $25-$30 million that would be there on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th years.  The total amount is accumulated overtime.  Bank Counsel has stated that school districts and municipalities they have worked with have seen a 20% increase on their sales taxes.  An outside vendor has stated that amount would run between 15% and 30% depending on how the records are retained and how good the job of the current collector is.  Staff is estimating 17% for the audit.  Director Hoy requested to have some time to discuss this further.

Director Deadwyler thanked staff for their patience and going through the process with her.  She wanted to make sure the staff addresses the questions she has presented and will wait for their responses before she can support this initiative.  Her concern with option one with regard to rubber tire services is that she had asked for different scenarios in terms of what it would look like.  She has found that one of the scenarios might throw RTD out of budget for 2014-2017 and would probably have to look elsewhere to find money to cover that shortfall.  One of her questions with regard to the $300 million is when the work will actually start.  If it starts now, and the money is being spent upfront because it will take a couple of years to save the total amount, based on underruns mentioned, RTD might have to reach into this money to cover for the shortfall and it would take even longer to save the money.  This brings another issue because there is no sunset and this could go on forever which is not fair either.  She stated that the Fiscal Sustainability team worked so hard to put the current policy together and now this initiative is throwing that out.  RTD would end up having no policy in place or change the entire policy to include this.  She has asked to see if something different can be done to include some language that under certain circumstances we would be able to revert back to where we are now instead of having to rewrite policy to go back if this doesn’t work.  She had proposed to separate the reserve funding out of this package.

Director Deadwyler thinks the Board needs to look at this very carefully before putting it in place.  Bill Van Meter stated that on the topic of sunset, the intent is for this is to be a short term commitment to expedite the FasTracks project.  Even though there is no specific date for the sunset it would be a Board option at any point to change it.  It is also noted that the intent is to get to the full rubber tire commitment as originally established; this is just a deferral in time and it will be articulated in the plans.  Director Cohen clarified that the commitment is not forgone, it’s only being deferred.  Bill Van Meter also stated that the reserve policy change from 3 months to 2 months is only for the FasTracks for the short term period 2014-2017.  Staff agreed they will provide more information for Director Deadwyler.  Director Cohen also clarified that on the 1% rubber-tire service the FAQs establish that it will still see a commitment at the CPI level and any year that there is a negative CPI there will be a 0% change in the rubber tire commitment.  Staff affirmed Director Cohen’s statement.

Director Deadwyler stated that even with the deferral it still throws the budget out because we would not be able to balance the budget from 2014-2017.  Terry Howerter stated that he did not see the sheets that Director Deadwyler mentioned that staff produced.  The sheets that they generated in answer to a GMR show that any year where there is a deficit in 2014-2015 created by the reduction of rubber-tire, they took money out of the Capital Acquisition fund to rebalance the budget.  That grew the Capital Acquisition fund slower overtime and he believes that what staff did is that they let the budget go negative.  Bill Van Meter also stated that what staff provided were two scenarios, one based on the SBP based on the earliest CU Leeds forecast and the second scenario with the same budget but using the updated August CU Leeds forecast.  This along with the actuals to date turned the negative balances to positives.  Terry Howerter will review the sheets and sit down with Director Deadwyler to make sure they understand and address her concerns.

Director Cohen stated that when he sat down with staff he understood that the RAM, while aggressive in some respects, has latitude for some flexibility and if the landscape would radically change we could revisit it but that is within the Board purview.

Director Deadwyler stated that she still has questions and is not ready to support it yet.  She doesn’t want it to go to unanimous consent until her questions are answered.

Director McMullen stated that he understands Director Deadwyler’s concerns and hopes the Board can be unanimous when this item is voted on at the December Board meeting.  This is a road map and the Board needs to see that FasTracks gets done.  It is the General Manager’s job is to show the Board how to get there.  This can be achieved without having to go back to the voters.  He is excited.  With regard to the Union Pacific, he doesn’t see a problem in the Southeast.  Value engineering was a great lesson in the West corridor and we have learned a lot.  In terms of the sunset, RTD as an organization does not have a sunset.  He congratulated GM Washington and the staff and stated that he will support the initiative.

Director Bagley thanked Director Hoy for his comments.  He stated for the new members that there is a reason why this is called the Regional Transportation District; we all need to think regionally.  The FasTracks program will make a difference for the next century.

Director O’Boyle thanked the GM and staff for seeking new ways to fund the FasTracks projects.  However, he is disappointed that the Southeast corridor is not identified as part of the priorities.   Also on the Southwest corridor, he believes deferral of the relocation falls into the same category as purchasing right of way or completing the federal environmental review process as they don’t provide immediate mobility benefit.   He takes note that the issue might raise concern from stakeholders for the reasons stated by Director Bagley.   He does not think it is a good move to reduce the support that we have for one area in order to relocated the funds to another area.  He wants to make sure that the concerns generated by the stakeholders are addressed.

On the concerns about the going over the cliff is the possibility of a recession.  Director O’Boyle remembers that the last recession was not fun and will not be fun for anybody including this agency.  He would want a caveat in the plan so that we do not put in concrete something that is dependent on the fiscal cliff that is far above our pay rate and beyond our control.  We need to wait and see what D.C. does.  On Director Deadwyler’s comments in terms of fiscal sustainability, we must increase service measurably.  We should not spend what we have just because we have it; that way we are not overextended.   He thinks that tailoring additional rubber tire services to the curtail FasTracks programs is a good move and consistent with what the agency should do with respect to increasing services.  He suggests that we should try to qualify for some of the rubber tire service expansion because we have cut steel and wheel service and if ware going to regain that service, it would require funds from our base system.

Director O’Boyle stated that there are a number of things to like; however, he will not support it tonight in order to have the discussion continue.

Director Walker stated that he thinks the strategy allows enough flexibility to change our position and move money around.  There is a risk on doing anything or not doing anything and he would rather air on the side of action.  He had some concerns about the relocation delay of the UP lines due to the traffic load.  He will support the recommendation and hopefully the neighboring communities that are eager to get service will participate to get those services in their area more quickly and put people on our buses and trains.  He will support the initiative.

Director Gore stated that with all the awards this agency has received both nationally and internationally, he looks forward to the day they receive an award for the boldness of moving this initiative forward.

GM Washington stated that when they put this exercise together they looked at risk versus reward and that is why they assigned a level of risk to each action.  They built in a level of flexibility to each item.  When we talk about sequestration and all the federal issues, we can turn around quickly.  The reward of accomplishing these projects is greater than the risk.  They would never come to the Board with initiatives that would decimate bus or rail services.  They would not come to ask for a deferral of the extension if they thought they could not do it in the future.  Getting FasTracks built as much as we can, as fast as we can is part of the mandate for the organization.  They would not bring something that will jeopardize the base system or derail the budget.  The amount of reward for getting I-225 or US-36 completed will be great.

Director Cohen thanked Director Gore for his comments.  He thanked the staff for the innovative thinking and acknowledged he is confident that the staff would not lead the Board into making decisions that are not financially prudent.

Committee Chair Cohen declared the motion PASSED.

### 2. Approval of the Purchase of Six Electric Multiple Units (EMU) Vehicles for the North Metro Rail Line

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the purchase of six Electric Multiple Units (EMU) vehicles for the North Metro Rail Line through the Denver Transit Partners (DTP) Rolling Stock Option in accordance with the EAGLE Concession Agreement (CA) Section 31.1, for an amount not to exceed $24 million.  Funding to purchase two of the vehicles is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North Metro Corridor project.

It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to transfer $16 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to the North Metro Corridor project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU vehicles.

Motion:               Director Tayer made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 18th, 2012 Board meeting.

Director Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director McMullen asked if there are any savings involved in this action.  GM Washington stated that there is a timeline to exercise the option to get these vehicles at the lower price.  Rick Clarke stated that if they do not exercise the option they would have to go out and bid it separately.  For such a small order the cost could be at least $25 million instead of $16 million and they would be a different type of vehicle, which will also impact the mechanics and train operators.  After December they would have to order a minimum of 8 cars for the option and there is no money for that in the budget.

Director Bagley stated that he thinks this is the most prudent thing to do.

Director Deadwyler asked why these vehicles are needed.  Rick stated that they will be used to provide service for the North Metro line.  Two cars will be for the Northwestern Stock Show and we need six cars to provide the service to 72nd.

Committee Chair Cohen declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

### 3. Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements and Indemnification of Claims with Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt the attached resolution.  The resolution authorizes the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute two easement agreements with Suncor; one agreement that grants an easement to RTD for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”) project through Suncor property in Adams County (the “Bridge Easement”) and another agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a pipeline in the RTD owned Boulder Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”).  The Bridge Easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable, and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in an amount up to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that amount from the date of commencement of construction of the bridge and to maintain it through termination of the Bridge Easement.  RTD would receive $10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement, and would pay Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement.  This would result in net revenue of $9,163,580 to RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.

It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve for the acquisition of the Bridge Easement.  These funds would be replenished out of the $10,000,000 to be received from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 18th, 2012 Board meeting.

Director Gore seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director James stated that this looks like a very good deal.  Staff stated that Suncor approached RTD with a price since they are trying to build the pipeline.  In addition to them paying RTD we are able to get an easement through their property.  Director James asked about sovereign immunity.  Marla Lien stated that RTD is subject to sovereign immunity and under state law there are caps to items for which RTD is liable up to $150,000 a person $650,000 per incident on liability.  Under federal law, it has not been tested against a governmental entity such as RTD; there is liability for passenger rail accidents for up to $200 million.  RTD is required to maintain $200 million of passenger rail liability on its entire corridor so we will not be increasing our insurance coverage.  RTD did something similar in agreeing with Union Pacific that as long as we have operating rights RTD would have $400 million for insurance.  A condition of this deal is that Suncor stated that since we are going through a refinery we are indemnifying them for our negligence only.

Director Daly asked if running a pipeline so close to the track is safe.  John Shonsey stated that the engineers feel that it is not a risk based on the specifications and location.  They kept it 25 feet away and buried 5 feet below ground.  They go through safety precautions and do continuous testing in the pipeline to ensure its integrity.  Director Daly asked if this is a regular practice.  John stated that in this corridor there are several similar conditions that have oil lines and gas lines.  Director Daly requested clarification about the amount stated in the first paragraph of the discussion.  It stated that Suncor agreed to pay $10 million for the bridge easement but Director Daly believed it should read for the pipeline easement.  John clarified that they are paying $10 million for the 15 miles easement for the pipeline.

Director Gore also asked for clarification on the feet information shown in the last paragraph of the Background Section.  John stated that the actual bridge is 5300; however, we only cross the property for 2200 feet.  Director Gore also asked about far away the neighborhood property line is from the pipeline.  He knows that the corridor is very narrow.  John estimates that it is 20 feet from the property line.  Director Gore asked who is responsible for notifying the cities or the public.  GM Washington stated that they would investigate to see who is responsible.   Gene Putman from the City of Thornton stated that Suncor talked to the City of and has been discussing this for almost 4 years.  The City has requested that they would not go through the subdivisions but through RTD right of way.

Director O’Boyle asked if this is a technical solution to put the pipeline under the tracks.  John clarified that this is not under the tracks; this is a safe distance away from the tracks.  From the engineering perspective they think it is a good and safe position.  Director O’Boyle also asked if the $10 million is included in the fiscal budget.  Staff stated that it would go towards the expansion of the North Metro Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility if approved by the Board.

Director Hoy asked if HUD allows for pipelines to go through residential areas.  Staff stated that they think HUD allows pipelines within 10 feet of the house.  This should not be an issue.

Director Walker asked if we know if the pipeline has been approved in the other communities.  Marla Lien stated that a representative from Commerce City came with Suncor to request RTD to approve the easement.  Director Walker also asked if the gravel access road is for RTD use.  John stated that it is for RTD use and it is over and above the $10 million.

Committee Chair Cohen declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. December 4 2012 Board Report Exhibits_Updated 2012-12-11

## IV. Other Matters

Director O’Boyle requested that since each Board member has each Board Report in front of them as part of the new eBoardroom system that Committee Chairs no longer read the Recommended Action language into the record.  Committee Chairs could simply state something like “is there a motion to approve the motion as outlined in the Board Report”.

## VI. Adjourn

Committee Chair Cohen adjourned the meeting at 9:23 p.m.
