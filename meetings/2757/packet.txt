G Line Safety Outreach Plan
BACKGROUND:

GOALS:
•

To inform schools, residents, stakeholders and the disabled community along the G Line
about commuter rail safety and provide tips for staying safe around the operation of the
commuter rail and its crossings.
• To provide an opportunity for students to experience rail grade crossings through
crossing mock-up at demonstration events
• To reach out to special interest groups and include them in safety messaging
• To provide real-life demonstrations at an actual crossing when possible and appropriate
for audience

AUDIENCES:
Focus on groups located within a mile radius from the centerline of the trackway.
Events and groups to target include:
• Safety demonstrations- RTD mock crossing
• Safety Days
• Back to school nights, school events
• Neighborhood Meetings
• One-on-one meetings
• School Bus Transportation
• Senior Centers
• Disabled Community, meetings
• Home Owner Associations
• Suicide Prevention Associations and Meetings
KEY MESSAGES:
Stop, Look, and Listen prior to crossing any railroad tracks. Commuter rail trains are quiet
and can approach from both directions.
•

•
•
•

Never play near commuter rail tracks or trains and do not walk on the rail tracks.
Switches on the tracks move automatically and can cause injury. In addition, you would
be breaking the law by trespassing.
Be safe near commuter rail platforms – there is a 4 foot drop from where you board the
train to where the actual tracks are.
Before crossing rail tracks at a road crossing, make sure to use the gate and that the
crossing gates are all the way up, and that there are no flashing lights or bells.
Keep yourself and all objects away from the overhead wires.
11
Packet Pg. 15

Attachment: G-LineCommPlan-Board (3520 : G Line Communications and Events)

Safety is a number one value for the Regional Transportation District. Commuter rail presents a
new technology to the region, making it important to educate communities on the differences
between light rail and commuter rail and how to be safe around the system.

1.C.1.a

•
•
•
•
•

Get off your bike, scooter, or skateboard before you cross the tracks. Wheels can get
caught in the opening next to the track.
When crossing the tracks, PAY ATTENTION – Don’t let your cell phones, headphones,
texting or game playing divert your attention.
Never chase a moving train.
Never play on or around construction equipment.
Always stay in public areas and don’t cross fences or barriers.

NORMAL PATTERN FOR GRAND OPENING ACTIVITIES

Thursday evening VIP Event
Friday Morning Station Opening Ribbon Cuttings, Grand Opening Ceremony and Public
Event
o Free Rides on G Line
Saturday Station Parties [hosted by cities; supported by RTD]
o Free Rides on Rail System

Through prior discussions with Senior Leadership, the events team is aware that lead time for
event preparations will be dramatically shortened. Past events have had up to a year’s worth of
lead time preparation [W Line], and as little as 6 weeks [R Line]. Discussions have centered
around 2-4 week lead times being expected for RTD to notify the public before entering revenue
service on the G Line.
Discussions with G Line stakeholders [Denver, AdCo, Wheat Ridge and Arvada] have indicated
the entities are committed to holding some form of smaller station parties ICW the Grand Opening
Celebrations [Saturday following Opening] rather than delay these for additional prep time.
One additional challenge with this line opening is a venue for the VIP Event. The event team
recognizes there is not a hotel or conveniently located venue adjacent to the G Line [Arvada
Center for Performing Arts is a good venue, albeit, 3-4 miles off the line, requiring bus shuttling].
We are working on setting up a discussion with the City of Arvada to provide access and assistance
with a proposed VIP event to be held on the second level of the Olde Town parking garage [this
provides existing cover and environmental stability with the least amount of modification to the
premises]. We are reaching out to the City this week to initiate this discussion – which we
anticipate going well, as Arvada has clearly indicated it wants to host events related to the Grand
Opening.

our light rail trains but larger vehicles meant to go longer distances and faster. They
feature storage areas for bags and bike and level boarding. Level boarding trains are
helpful for passengers in wheel chairs and passengers traveling with luggage.

CHALLENGES
•

The EAGLE P3 Project is a $2.2 billion Project involving the design, construction, finance,
operation and maintenance of three new commuter rail lines and a commuter rail facility.
RTD engaged Denver Transit Partners (DTP), a consortium led by Fluor and Balfour

Beatty as the Concessionaire. The Project was slated for completion and revenue service
in 2016, with a 29-year concession period.
DTP committed to design and construct a modern Positive Train Control (PTC) system
with a first of its kind Wireless Crossing Activation System (WCAS) functionality to meet
regulatory requirements for Quiet Zones and grade crossing safety. The system was to
provide a constant warning time to ensure a reasonably uniform warning time, regardless
of train speed, to reinforce crossing safety and discourage unsafe behavior at grade
crossings.
DTP experienced a variety of issues during design, construction, systems testing, and
operation that impacted DTP’s ability to obtain regulators’ acceptance of the new system.
In April 2016, the University of Colorado A Line entered revenue service under an FRA
waiver and employing grade crossing attendants at the crossings. Since that time, DTP
has taken steps to optimize the system, hired outside consultants to review the system,
and respond to regulators’ questions about the grade crossing warning system. The
system continues to operate under an FRA waiver.
Both the FRA and the CPUC have utilized their existing processes to ensure, based on
credible, measurable data that the grade crossing warning system operates safely. In
addition, DTP experienced further delays in completing field inspections, obtaining
approvals of testing protocols and completing operational verifications with trains to
ensure the warning system operates as designed.
Now, most of the field verifications are complete, and RTD expects the CPUC to accept
the remaining University of Colorado A Line crossings in the next 2 or 3 weeks. Upon FRA
approval of the grade crossing attendant removal plan for those crossings, RTD will begin
a public notification campaign reminding roadway users to obey the warning devices at
the crossings, after which the flaggers will be removed from the crossings in a controlled
manner.
DTP has not yet obtained approval from the FRA to begin the final testing necessary to
begin revenue service on the G Line.

• Parking fees at RTD Park-n-Rides depend on if your car is registered within RTD district.
o In-District: first 24 hours free, $2/daily after first 24 hours
o Out-of-District: $4 daily fee
• Being in-district or out-of-district depends on where your car is registered, not where
you currently live.
• You can pay for parking at the pay station, pay by phone or download the app.
• Vehicles may not be parked continuously for longer than 30 days.
Safety
• Safety is RTD’s number one priority and we want to remind people to be safe around
trains
• Stop, Look, and Listen prior to crossing any railroad tracks; commuter rail trains are
quiet and can approach from both directions
• Never play near commuter rail tracks or trains and do not walk on the rail tracks.
Switches on the tracks move automatically and can cause injury. In addition, you would
be breaking the law by trespassing
• Be safe near commuter rail platforms – there is a 4 foot drop from where you board the
train to where the actual tracks are
• Before crossing rail tracks at a road crossing, make sure to use the gate and that the
crossing gates are all the way up, and that there are no flashing lights or bells
• Keep yourself and all objects away from the overhead wires
• Get off your bike, scooter, or skateboard before you cross the tracks. Wheels can get
caught in the opening next to the track
• When crossing the tracks, PAY ATTENTION – Don’t let your cell phones, headphones,
texting or game playing divert your attention
• Never chase a moving train
• Never play on or around construction equipment
• Always stay in public areas and don’t cross fences or barriers

Service Changes
When the G Line opens the following bus routes and Park-n-Rides affected:
• New routes – 53, 55, 99, 125
• Discontinued routes – 31L, 55L, 72L
• Route modifications – 8, 17, 19, 31, 50, 51, 52, 72, 76, 100
• Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride will be moving across the street to the Olde Town
Arvada Station
• Ward Road Park-n-Ride will be closing and replaced with Wheat Ridge/Ward Station (1mile away)
Positive Train Control
• As part of the commuter train safety, the trains use Positive Train Control Technology
(PTC).
• If a train is traveling too fast, a train is stopped ahead or a maintenance crew is working
on the track, PTC signals the operator to slow or stop the train.
• If the operator doesn’t respond within 8 seconds, the train will automatically slow or
stop.
• PTC technology is a Federal Railroad Administration requirement for all passenger rail
systems in the country. RTD is the first in the U.S. to have PTC built into a commuter
rail system “from the ground up”.
Commuter Rail
• The University of Colorado A Line is the first rail line to have commuter rail trains.
• Each railcar is 85 feet long.
• Runs in “married pairs”- two vehicles attached at once
• LCD screens and overhead announcements provide updates on current location and
upcoming stations.
• They have some different features than light rail trains:
o Designed to travel faster, longer distances with less stops
o Max speed is 79 MPH (light rail is 55 MPH)
o 91 seats
o Level boarding
o Luggage racks, overhead carry-on storage areas and areas for skis/bikes
o Two ADA/handicapped seating areas per train car
• The vehicles will be maintained, serviced and cleaned at the commuter rail maintenance facility
(CRMF) at 5151 Fox St. in Denver’s Globeville neighborhood.

Quiet Zones:
•
•

•

•
•
•
•

Federal Law requires all trains that travel on or adjacent to freight tracks to sound
their horns when the train approaches a railroad crossing. This falls under the
Federal Train Horn Rule (49 CFR Part 222).
Quiet Zones are railroad line segments where train operators don’t have to sound
their train horns at the crossing on a routine basis. Horns will continue to be used for
emergency situations and if there are maintenance workers along the tracks, as
required by the Federal Regulation.
Quiet Zones are not guaranteed to be implemented by opening day on any corridor.
The zones will be established once all regulatory approvals are processed which
could be after each opening of any rail line. However, all entities are working hard to
certify the railroad crossings so that Quiet Zones can start by the opening day of the
Gold (G) Line.
Adams County and the City of Arvada have already both submitted applications for
Quiet Zones along the entire Gold (G) Line; RTD assisted in the application process.
The public should expect to hear train horns during the testing of the Gold (G) Line
until the Quiet Zones are approved and established.
Until Quiet Zones are established, locomotive engineers must begin to sound train
horns at least 15 seconds, and no more than 20 seconds, in advance of all public
grade crossings.
If a train is traveling faster than 60 mph, engineers will not sound the horn until it is
within a 1/4 mile of the crossing, even if the advance warning is less than 15
seconds.

At-Grade Crossings:

1.C.1.a

•
•

•
•

•

There is a "good faith" exception for locations where engineers cannot precisely
estimate their arrival at a crossing and begin to sound the horn no more than 25
seconds before arriving at the crossing.
Train horns must be sounded in a standardized pattern of 2 long, 1 short and 1 long
blasts. The pattern must be repeated or prolonged until the lead locomotive or lead
cab car occupies the grade crossing. The rule does not stipulate the durations of
long and short blasts.
The maximum volume level for the train horn is 110 decibels which is a new federal
requirement. The minimum sound level remains 96 decibels.
RTD’s Responsible Rail Amendment: Federal regulations require cities and counties
to file the application for requesting a quiet zone. In 2007, the RTD Board adopted
the Responsible Rail Amendment, which calls for active involvement from RTD in
helping communities establish Quiet Zones along commuter rail lines.
To qualify for a quiet zone, many safety measures were built into the crossings and
include exit gates, pedestrian gates, channelization, safety signage, and
audible/visual alerts.

Even when the Quiet Zones are approved, the operator is obligated to use their horn in
any event they consider “unsafe” or if there are maintenance workers along the tracks.
Likewise, at any time the FRA deems it necessary, the quiet zone can be eliminated and
horn use resumed due to an increase in unsafe incidents at the crossing(s).

Re:

Service Availability - June 2018

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 98.98% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in June 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons did increase as follows:





June 2018 – 1,444.99 hours
June 2017 - 203.13 hours
Year-to-date numbers 2017 – 1,421.75 hours
Year-to-day number for 2018 - 8,740.53 hours

While RTD did provide in excess of 98.98% of all scheduled hours of service in the
month, it was necessary to cover 2,195 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 17,560 hours of service being
provided by a “6th day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours
provided by our Contractor Partners, First Transit, and TransDev.
Contributing to our service challenges in June were multiple bus bridges and special
events. Staff continues to work with Human Resources and other departments to address
ways to improve recruitment and retention among bus operators.

Approval of ERP Licenses

CFO/AGM,

GM
Board Meeting Date: July 17, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to Mythics for licenses for the ERP Replacement Program for an amount not to exceed $2,000,000
over 5 years. Subscriptions for the ERP Replacement Program will be paid annually.
This recommendation addresses two of the General Manager’s 2018 goals:
Financial Management and Task Goal #1 Fiscal Sustainability.

Core Goal #3 Strong

BACKGROUND:
The current Oracle e-business suite (EBS) enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation at RTD is
approaching end of life. Oracle will end support for the EBS system in 2021.
Starting in 2017, the Information Technology team began researching various approaches for the ERP
replacement. Modern ERP solutions are moving toward a cloud-based, specialized solution. Three options
for replacement were presented to the AGM’s for consideration:
1. Upgrade the existing ERP Oracle system to Oracle Cloud
2. Implement another vendor’s single cloud ERP solution (such as SAP or Workday)
3. Use a best-of-breed hybrid approach by implementing ERP cloud-based solutions for specific lines
of business (such as finance and human resources)
The options were presented to the AGM’s and they determined to use a best-of-breed, hybrid approach.
This enables RTD to take advantage of the strengths of various cloud-based solutions to improve
business operations and more closely align the cloud/software solution to business process. Cloud tools
make it easier to implement a best-of-breed approach and they also allow for integration between the
differing systems.
During the research phase, demonstrations of several vendor’s solutions were held with RTD business
units to determine the functionality needs and best fit for RTD business processes. Through this series
of demos and requirements gathering sessions, the determination was made that finance related
modules would stay in one cloud-based solution forming the ERP backbone, or backend system. The
solution that was chosen was Oracle cloud. The human resources and payroll modules will utilize a
different cloud-based solution that has not yet been determined. Some examples of the finance related
modules (and those that are dependent on finance modules) include:





General ledger
Accounts payable
Account receivable
Assets

Packet Pg. 38

2.B.1






Procurement
Inventory planning and forecasting
Public sector budgeting
Sourcing, supplier, and contract management

The first phase of the ERP replacement project includes the following modules:
1. Public sector planning and budgeting
2. Inventory planning and forecasting
3. Sourcing, supplier and contract management
The current Public Sector Planning and Budgeting module is outdated and does not provide the
functionality needed by RTD. It is no longer supported by the vendor. The Inventory Planning and
Forecasting module is outdated and does not provide advanced functionality that enables efficient
business performance. This module will reach end of life and no longer be supported by the vendor after
2021. Sourcing, Supplier and Contract Management is a new module that will be added to the ERP
program once licenses are procured and will allow for easier management of contracts and vendor
interactions.
Over the past eighteen months, multiple vendors were invited to demo their solutions for these three
modules with RTD business units. The Oracle solution best fit the needs of the business units as well as
the specific public-sector business needs of RTD. In the case of public sector budgeting, Oracle is the
only solution that performs the functions needed for public sector. Oracle was also chosen because of
the dependence and integration needed between these modules and the finance backbone.
The Board previously approved a total of $15,000,000 for the ERP Replacement Program in the 2018 2023 Strategic Budget Plan. The contract authority recommended in this board action will use a portion
of this approved funding for this first set of ERP program licenses.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an RFI to obtain pricing for these three modules with the National Association of State
Budget Officers (NASBO), US Communities, and The Cooperative Purchasing Network (TCPN). Each of
these organizations have pre-negotiated contracts with the State of Colorado. The State bid and
awarded these contracts through their standard procurement processes and these contracts allow other
governmental agencies to utilize them. Two firms submitted proposals. The criteria used to evaluate the
proposals was license cost.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $2,000,000. Funding for these licenses is included in the approved
ERP Replacement Program budget.

The yearly breakdown for the licenses is as follows:
2018
2019
2020
2021
2022

$400,000

2. Remain on our existing ERP implementation with one module currently out of support and the
remaining modules no longer supported by the vendor after 2021.

Analysis

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a five-year contract to Active Navigation in the
total not-to-exceed amount of $869,539 for a data and content analysis software (record crawler).
This recommended action addresses the General Manager’s 2018 goals - Task Goal #1 Fiscal
Sustainability, and Task Goal #3 Asset Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
Since RTD began using personal computers and related technology to support its mission, our employees
have created, received and saved electronic files on RTD’s network shared drives. Today, there are
more than 9,000 – nine thousand – gigabytes (GB) of electronic files in RTD’s shared drives alone.
Translated to paper, that is 8 billion pages, 8 million file boxes (at 1,000 pages per box), or more than
4,500 round trips to the moon if each page is placed end-to-end.
In this digital age, all organizations including RTD are facing steadily increasing information management
challenges. These challenges include increased regulatory requirements that now focus on information
assets more than ever before, security and privacy issues, and email and web communications. To
support best practices in information governance, lifecycle management, and records management, and
to most efficiently leverage the information and data in our custody, RTD must take control of this
tsunami of data. A well-established software tool called a “crawler” is a standard method to identify and
flag files for transfer or deletion, helping reduce the total volume of electronic files to manage while
ensuring that the information RTD relies on is quickly accessible.
DISCUSSION
In August 2016, IQ Business Group (IQBG), a highly respected information governance consultant,
presented RTD with recommendations to improve our records management program after a careful
assessment of the existing program. IQBG’s recommendations included combining RTD’s various
document control and information governance staff into a unified Information Governance &
Management (IGM) Division, creating records liaisons within each department, and other
recommendations.
The purchase of a data and content analysis tool – a crawler – was one of IQBG’s recommendations
after a pilot crawl of a small portion of RTD’s network revealed that roughly 40% of the total content
fell into the category of low value. For this exercise there were five classifications that made up the low
value category:



Temporary – 2% of files were created by system processes (i.e., .tmp file extensions)
Duplicates – 30% of the files assessed were duplicates

Packet Pg. 41

2.B.2





Non-Business – 24% files identified as multimedia content named in a way that indicates it is not
related to business (Christmas, holiday, vacation, etc.)
Old – 26% content with a modified date greater than ten years.
Identified low value – 18% content identified in the name or by folder as being a first draft, or an
older version, of content that should be deleted.

Another factor in the analysis was the risk content that was identified. Approximately 280,000 files on
the network showed a number that appears like a social security number or a credit card number.
The term “crawler” is most often seen in the context of internet searches: a “web crawler” – also
known as a “spider” – is an automated tool that browses through the internet in a systematic way,
creating an updating a search engine index and helping make sense of the huge amount of online
information. Google and Bing would not exist without automated crawlers.
For individual enterprises like RTD, crawlers serve similar indexing and search functions for data in a
variety of formats, but they also perform the crucial task of identifying files that can and should be
deleted. Appropriate deletion of data is important because data costs potentially enormous sums of
money to manage – especially in the context of litigation e-discovery – and value can only be derived
from data if the information is accessible and usable. Not all data has equal value – to a computer, an
employee’s vacation snapshot can take up just as much space on RTD’s files and require just as much
management as critical operational data – but all data must be evaluated for its value (or lack of value)
and retained or deleted based on that evaluation. A crawler is the key automation tool to perform such
evaluation and promote efficient retrieval of valuable data. A crawler can also identify information that
needs to be secured. Conducting such searches and evaluation manually is virtually impossible given the
amounts of data at issue, while an automated crawler uses algorithms to quickly and accurately identify
files that can and should be deleted.
To more efficiently and securely manage RTD’s data and information, and optimize storage in
compliance with RTD’s records retention policy, subject to approval of this Recommended Action the
IGM Division will use a crawler to search and analyze RTD’s structured and unstructured electronic
information. IGM’s goal is to reduce storage of information in unauthorized locations, identify and
remove duplicates (de-duping), reduce storage costs, identify the most current version of duplicates to
preserve as the record copy, and improve current processes and practices when it comes to managing
information as an organization.
The crawler is one strategy that IGM intends to use to reach these goals by better identifying redundant
information. Another strategy is to implement a records liaison program to interface with IGM as the
Division’s eyes and ears. A third strategy is the assessment program to determine compliance of
departments across RTD with the records management and information governance policies and
procedures.
This technology will be used in conjunction with RTD’s Enterprise Content Management (ECM) tool,
Laserfiche, to capture the original and authentic record. Duplicate and redundant files will be flagged for
destruction in accordance with RTD policies and procedures. These actions will help reduce the cost of
doing business, minimize the risk of keeping records past their retention period, and lower legal
expenses.
The RFP was advertised on October 16, 2017. RTD received five proposals. Active Navigation was
selected as the best value based on software features, functionality, maintenance and support, and
price.

Packet Pg. 42

2.B.2

The proposed contract with Active Navigation is for a not-to-exceed amount of $869,539 covering all
five years, and includes a five-year licensing agreement, implementation, testing, maintenance, training,
and support.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Most of the funding is accounted for in the 2018 - 2023 Strategic Budget Plan within IGM’s operating
budget and approved capital award. Crawler software Award #LC-01-3309-16 and Award #LC-013309-15 have cumulative funds at $650,000; implementation and integration Award #LC-01-3309-16
has $74,880, and Support and Maintenance from the expense budget has $100,000 for a grand total of
$824,880. The balance of the funds will come from the Data Processing budget line in the IGM O&M
budget.
The cost savings/avoidance to be realized is significant. The Crawler will:
 Reduce the volume of electronic files to review during eDiscovery.
 Decrease time spent searching for information. An estimated 15–25% of employees’ time is
spent on nonproductive information–related activities.
 Eliminate redundant, obsolete and trivial files (ROT) to keep storage costs down.
 Identify the authentic record for business and engineering decisions to avoid costly mistakes.
 Eliminate shadow systems that hold duplicate information.
 Provide the legally defensible deletion of e-trash, ROT, stale and low value content.
 Effectively identify and protect personally identifiable information, personal health information,
sensitive security information, and protected critical infrastructure information.
 Move the authentic records to the correct repository to reduce duplication of files, or re-creation
of the record.
 Enhance compliance with current processes and practices to manage information overall at RTD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a five-year contract to Active Navigation in
the total not-to-exceed amount of $869,539 for a data and content analysis software (record
crawler).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to
award a contract to Active Navigation in the amount of $869,539 for the data and content analysis
software. This alternative is not recommended because without a crawler, RTD would continue to
generate and store data and information at an exponential rate, with lessened security and increased
search and e-discovery costs. RTD would have to rely on costly, inefficient and less reliable manual
methods to try to manage electronic information, resulting in greater personnel costs, reduced
effectiveness, and greater risk of liability.

(2) Variance is due to the timing of rail line openings and parts and wages being lower than expected
(3) Variance is due to the timing of payment for management services

(5) Variance is primarily due to the timing of payment for outside security services and contracted maintenance in which accruals are recorded at year-end
(6) Variance is primarily due to higher-than-expected self-insured claims for liability and worker's compensation
(7) Variance is primarily due to the timing of purchase of data processing services in which encumbrances have been incurred
(8) Variance is primarily due to the timing of production of outside promotional and informational materials and costs related to rail openings
