GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

VIII.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A.

Authorization to Appoint RTD Representatives for Denver Union Station Project
Authority
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Chairman of the
RTD Board of Directors appoint two RTD representatives to the Denver Union Station
Project Authority (the Authority) Board of Directors. The Authority will be a non-profit
corporation formed under the authority of the City and County of Denver for the
purposes of issuing revenue bonds, receiving revenues and paying expenses for the
Denver Union Station project.

B.

Conveyance of Easements or Leases to the USNC for Purposes of Creating Denver
Union Station Metropolitan District
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the General Manager
be authorized to convey five easements or leases to USNC or its designees for the
purposes of creating elector’s parcels for an election for the formation of the Denver
Union Station (DUS) Metropolitan Districts (the Met Districts) which will include a
management and four taxing districts. A TABOR election will also be held. The Met
Districts will be authorized to establish mill levies for payment of debt service for
capital projects and for their operation and maintenance at DUS.

C.

Proposed Amendment to CDOT/RTD IGA for Funding for US36 BRT Phase 2 Final
Environmental Impact Statement
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors authorizes the General Manager to proceed with an amendment to the
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with CDOT to fund the preparation of the Final
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the US36 Corridor. RTD’s total funding
share for this action for the US36 BRT Phase 2 would be for 25 percent of the cost of
preparation of the FEIS and Record of Decision (ROD), not to exceed $1,000,000. This
action is necessary to continue the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process,
and to develop and assess the impacts of the Preferred Alternative and to prepare the
ROD.
It is further recommended that the Board of Directors authorize a transfer of
$1,000,000 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to fund the preparation of the
FEIS and ROD. This will accelerate funding that was provided for the corridor in 2009
in the FasTracks Financial Plan.

D.

Recommendation for Contract Award to Kumar and Associates, Inc. for the FasTracks
Owner’s Materials Verification Testing Services Contract
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract to the most qualified proposer, Kumar and Associates,
Inc., in an estimated not-to-exceed amount of $5,000,000 for Owner’s Materials
Verification Testing Services for FasTracks. This is a multi-year contract spanning
2008 – 2013, with the provision for additional five one-year options. The work scope
will be negotiated annually to allow flexibility in supporting the FasTracks projects, and
funded through project budgets that will require separate RTD Board actions. Funds for
the initial contract award of $50,000 are contained in the 2008 RTD Budget for the
West Corridor.

E.

Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. (ACS) (CAD/AVL) Sole Source Fixed End Upgrade
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award
a sole-source contract to Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. (ACS) in the amount notto-exceed $2,700,000. The procurement is for fixed-end hardware and software
system updates to the agency’s computer aided dispatch and automatic vehicle location
system (CAD/AVL).

F.

Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the
“Agreement”).

IX.

G.

Modification to RTD Investment Policy
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Investment Policy (the “Policy”), modified to change the
title “Senior Manager of Finance” to that of “Chief Financial Officer” and to authorize
Terry L. Howerter, as Chief Financial Officer, to transact investment business on behalf
of the District (please see Appendix I to Policy).

H.

State Legislative Liaison Services
It is recommended by the Legislative Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into Contract No. 17-DX-001 with
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs, which is an agreement for state legislative liaison
services for one year (July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009) at a cost of $95,000 and
four (4) additional one-year options to renew at prices specified in the Contract, each
option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors.
