BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Date:

Subject:

Modeling On-Call Contract Amendment

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: March 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract
with AECOM for travel modeling services. The current contract value is $355,706.62. This
amendment increases the value by $535,000 to a total of $890,706.62. Funding is included in the
2017 expense budget and the budget for the SH 119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.
BACKGROUND
In 2013 RTD awarded a contract to AECOM to perform travel modeling on an as-needed basis, The
contractor performs work when required due to limitations of RTD resources and/or expertise for the
particular task and time. Work has been performed in the context of National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) studies; Federal Transit Administration (FTA) New Starts submittals; Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) regional planning activities as required by Federal planning law; RTD internal
planning studies; RTD budget development and contract analysis; and preliminary engineering, final
design, and construction of FasTracks corridors.
The contract is for three years with two one-year renewable options at RTD’s sole discretion. RTD has
exercised these options and 2017 is the last year of the contract. The initial contract value was
$309,706.62. A previous amendment in 2013 increased the value by $46,000 to reach the current
value of $355,706.62.
DISCUSSION
One key purpose is to provide travel modeling services for the SH-119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Planning and Engineering Study. That study will require travel modeling for numerous BRT
alternatives to develop ridership and related data for decision-making.
A second purpose of this contract amendment is to make travel model updates. The Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) requires recipients of Full Funding Grant Agreements (FFGAs) to regularly
update travel forecasting models for the projects receiving grants. RTD makes use of three travel
models:
1. A traditional four-step model originally developed by DRCOG called Compass
2. A state-of-the-art tour-based model developed by DRCOG called Focus
3. A transit ridership forecasting model developed by FTA called Simplified Trips-on-Project
Software (STOPS)

Packet Pg. 3

2.B.1

Of the $535,000 being requested for this contract amendment, it is expected that $285,000 will be
used for travel model updates and $250,000 will be used for the SH-119 BRT Environmental
Clearance project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2017 expense budget and the budget for the SH
119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to
execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with AECOM for travel modeling
services. The current contract value is $355,706.62. This amendment increases the value by
$535,000 to a total of $890,706.62. Funding is included in the 2017 base system expense
budget and the budget for the SH 119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it will delay the
completion of travel model calibration and the SH 119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX
• No rate-making policy in original parking program
• Cumulative CPI for 2008-2016 was 17.5%
– $2.00 X 1.175 = $2.35
– How would 17.5% increase impact ridership and parking?
– Recent RTD Study (elasticity of parking demand):
– 17.5% increase in parking rates has potential:
• Loss of parking from 6% to 18%
• Loss of ridership from 3% to 18%

– Offset by site specific conditions that will backfill losses
• service alternatives, distance, traffic conditions
• latent demand for parking…system-wide15 p-n-r over 93% usage

Local Government Relations Update

The following are items for March 7, 2017:
1. Transportation Funding – The Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) continues to be actively

engaged in discussions regarding increased transportation funding for Colorado. As I
have reported previously, the MMC reconvened the MPACT64 Coalition, which has met
three times since December. MPACT64 members are focused on ensuring funding for
mobility infrastructure (transit, pedestrians, and bicycles) is a part of any statewide
solution.
2. Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) – The next full caucus meeting is April 5 from 7:30-10
A.M. Meetings are held at the Metro Denver Chamber, 1445 Market St.
3. Citizens Advisory Committee – Eight CAC/Board member meetings will have been
completed by March 7 with three more scheduled. I am still working to schedule the
remaining four directors. The Committee will be updating the Board at the Planning/
Capital Programs/FasTracks Committee meetings on a quarterly basis beginning in April.
Director Lubow agreed to have the update occur quarterly, rather than monthly, so they
can be more substantive.
4. APTA Legislative Conference – I will be in Washington, D.C. for two days overlapping
the APTA Legislative Conference (I’m not registered to attend) and hope to have the
opportunity to visit with attending board members and staff.

Re:

Update

Congratulations on the opening of the R Line! It was great to see RTD Board Members,
Executive Staff, State and Local Elected Officials at the event to celebrate this great
achievement.
BBMK continues to schedule and attend meetings with General Manager Genova to update
newly elected legislators on the District’s activities.
BBMK is working with the Chair of the House Transportation Committee Representative Diane
Mitsch Bush to coordinate a P3 discussion during the interim. We had orginally planned it
during the discussion but the Chair asked us to move the date as to not distract from the larger
transportation funding conversation under the dome.
BBMK monitors and attends transportation committee meetings as well as continues to
participate in discussions regarding state wide transportation infrastructure funding needs.
SB17-153 Southwest Chief and Front Passenger Rail Commission sponsored by Senators Garcia
and Crowder and Rep. Esgar passed the Senate. The bill replaces the Southwest Chief Rail Line
Commission housed in CDOT with the Southwest Chief and Front Passenger Rail Commission.
The new commission will assume the duties of the old commission which was set to repeal on
July 1, 2017. These duties include the coordination of efforts to ensure that track repairs and
upgrades required for continuation of existing Southwest Chief Rail service in Colorado are
completed, extending rail service to Pueblo and exploring the benefits of extending service to
Walsenberg. The Commission is also tasked with developing draft legislation that facilities the
development of a passenger rail system that provides service in and along the I-25 corridor. An
appointee from the District would be a member of the Board. This bill supported by CDOT is
a way to have all stakeholders involved in this discussion formally at the table.
HB17-1171 Authorize New Transportation Revenue Anticipation Notes sponsored by Reps.
Carver and Buck is scheduled for a hearing on March 29th at 1:30pm in the House State
Veterans and Military Affairs Committee. This bill requires that the Transportation Commission
submit a ballot question in November of 2017 asking voters to approve $3.5 billion in bonds for
transportation funding. The bill would also set aside 10 percent of all future state sales tax for
transportation projects.

SB17-040 Public Access to Government Files sponsored by Senators Kefalas and Gardner and
Rep. Pabon is scheduled for a hearing on March 1st at 1:30pm in the Senate State Veterans and
Military Affairs Committee. The bill concerns public access to digital database records. The
Secretary of State is supporting this legislation. Several organizations such as the Colorado
Counties Incorporate, Sherriff’s Association and Colorado Water Congress have opposed the
bill. The AG’s office will be offering amendments to the bill which BBMK forwarded to the
district for review.
HB17-1177 Mediation for Disputes Arising Under CORA sponsored by Reps. Wist and
Garnett and Senator Cooke is scheduled for a hearing on March 16 upon adjournment in the
State Veteran’s and Military Affairs Committee. This bill is intended to encourage records
requesters and government entities to resolve disputes through mediation rather than in the court
system. The bill would require the requesters and records custodians to evenly split the cost of
hiring a mediator.
In addition to monitoring transportation related legislation BBMK continues follow closely any
sales tax bills which have a direct operational impact on the district.
HB17-1103 Sales and Use Tax Exemption for Historic Aircraft sponsored by Reps. Nordberg
and Pabon and Senators Moreno and Gardner passed the House Appropriations Committee this
morning. This bill is trying to address an issue of out of state historic aircraft owners wanting to
loan the aircrafts to museums in Colorado and want to make sure there is no tax imposed during
this process. The fiscal note only mentions a “potential impact.” BBMK will monitor the bill
however does not think it would have a significant impact on the District.
HB17-1127 Exempt Feminine Hygiene Products from Sales Tax sponsored by Rep. Lontine
and Senator Martinez Humenik passed the House Finance Committee. The bill creates a state
sales tax exemption, commencing January 1, 2018, for all sales, storage, and use of feminine
hygiene products. The bill has a large fiscal note and will likely not survive the appropriations
committee because of the current makeup of the legislature.
HB17-1195 Create a State Sales Tax Exemption for Diapers sponsored by Rep. Winter and
Senator Martinez Humenik was introduced and assigned to the House Finance and House
Appropriations Committee. The bill creates a sales tax exemption, commencing January 1, 2018
for the sale, storage and use of diapers. The bill further allows local taxing jurisdictions to adopt
the same exemption.
BBMK is monitoring bills related to Construction Defects and have included them for board
members that are interested in this issue.
SB17-045 Construction Defect Claim Allocation of Defense Costs sponsored by Senators

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: MARCH 7, 2017
President Trump’s Infrastructure Proposal

Trump announced he “will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion
investment in the infrastructure of the United States — financed through both public and private
capital.” It is important to note that the President did not pledge $1 trillion in direct Federal funding or
finance tools (such as Federal loans), but instead called for support for legislation that “produces” a $1
trillion investment, showing that he apparently intends to leverage limited Federal funds with both nonFederal public funding and private investment.
One question that remains unanswered is how this infrastructure package will be paid for. The two
largest revenue sources that have been identified as palatable by some Congressional Republicans – a tax
on earnings held overseas by US companies and the so-called “border adjustability tax” on imports –
have both been viewed by tax-writers as ways to pay for lower tax rates – not infrastructure spending.
Another outstanding issue is the timing for moving infrastructure legislation. Amid struggles by
Republicans in both the House and Senate to craft legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, reform
the tax code, and pass spending bills for the remainder of FY 2017 and FY 2018, some sources are
reporting that passage of any large infrastructure bill could be pushed back to 2018.
Transportation Appropriations and the President’s FY 2018 Budget
For fiscal year 2017 (ending September 30, 2017), nearly all agencies and programs of the Federal
government continue to operate under a Continuing Resolution through April 28. Accordingly, the
Federal Transit Administration released partial-year apportionments of transit formula funds in January,
but New Starts funding – which is derived from the General Fund, not the Highway Trust Fund –
cannot be awarded until passage of a full-year appropriations bill later this spring.
For fiscal year 2018, Congressional leaders await the release of the President’s budget, set for March 16.
It is expected to be a so-called “skinny” budget with few details, due to the limited time the new
President has had to develop it since taking office. Trump is reportedly relying on budget advice from
the Heritage Foundation, which has called for deep spending cuts in both entitlements and discretionary
spending, and the conservative group has targeted Federal transit funding in the past. At this time, there
is no reliable information on how Federal transit programs (or other popular discretionary programs like
TIGER) will fare in the President’s 2018 budget proposal.
Regulatory Reform Task Forces
President Trump has committed to advancing infrastructure projects more quickly by streamlining
Federal permitting processes. Consistent with that aim, on February 24, Trump ordered all Federal
agencies to identify for elimination or revision those agency rules that stifle U.S. jobs and economic
growth. Trump made clear he supported environmental protection and safety, but was concerned with
regulations that burden U.S. competitiveness. Task forces will be created within each Federal agency to
oversee this regulatory reform effort.

Attachment: Federal Update 3 7 2017 (3066 : Federal Update - Patton Boggs)

Declaring that “the time has come for a new program of national rebuilding" akin to President
Eisenhower’s Interstate construction program, President Trump used the occasion of his first address to
a joint session of Congress to call for greater investment in the nation’s “crumbling” transportation
systems.
