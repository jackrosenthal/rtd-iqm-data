BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Low/No Emissions Bus Study Session

Committee Meeting Date:
June 7, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Frederick Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
50 minutes
BACKGROUND
Over the past decade, public transit providers throughout the United States have adopted policies
incorporating low-emission and/or zero-emission fleet technologies (low/no emissions technology) with a
goal of promoting environmental sustainability through daily transit service delivery. RTD has operated a
sub-fleet of 36 battery electric buses (BEBs) along the 16th Street Mall since 2018. RTD is in the
process of acquiring 17 additional BEBs that are anticipated to integrated into the existing fleet in 2023.
The Board of Directors has expressed an interest in participating in a study session to garner an
understanding of low/no emissions technology in the public transportation realm; the performance of the
agency’s existing sub-fleet; and, how these technologies support the agency’s strategic priority of
Community Value, which is, “RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to
customers as well as the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth.”
DISCUSSION
The study session will cover:
• Low/no emission fleet technologies
• Environmental impacts
• Existing fleet performance
• Lessons learned
• Current fleet/infrastructure implementation status
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no immediate-term financial impact.

Environmental Impacts
“When looking at the deployment [environmental] benefits, consider “well-to-

wheel emissions.” While ZEBs [Zero Emission Buses] have no harmful tailpipe
emissions, there will most likely be upstream greenhouse gas emissions from
electricity generation for charging BEBs [Battery Electric Buses], production,
and delivery for fueling.”
