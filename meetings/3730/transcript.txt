advice related to workplace investigations. I would like to append the motion to move into executive session
to state that the special board meeting will be deemed adjourned after it adjourns into the executive session.
For public transparency, this means that once the Board moves into executive session, the main meeting
will be adjourned. I will now entertain a motion to move into executive session to discuss the following.
Pursuant to Section 24-6-402, subsection 4, paragraph B CRS to receive legal advice regarding workplace
investigations.
DOUG TISDALE: So moved. Tisdale.
TROY WHITMORE: Second.
PEGGY CATLIN: Second.
ERIK DAVIDSON: I have Tisdale as the movement. And the second is Whitmore. Is there any one
opposed? Seeing none. That will be 11 votes yes, with four absent. That will pass at this time. All those
entitled are expected to remain. Please remain seated. For those of you that are attending on Zoom, please
leave this Zoom room and move into the executive session Zoom room.
Please allow about five minutes for us to transition the technology between sessions, and then we will
reconvene in executive session. For all those who are to be here, please just remain patient for the next
five minutes and stay seated. Thank you.
