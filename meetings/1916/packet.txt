BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 15, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 14, 2014

Board Meeting Date: May 20, 2014

Subject:

Approval of August 2014 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2014 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A and,
further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary
for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will adjust services in response to
changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. As part of an overall
effort to maintain our light rail system in a state of good repair, we are proposing changes to the late
night service on light rail, which will create a wider maintenance window for repairs to infrastructure.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate impacts on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Six public hearings were held between May 7 th and May 14th in Evergreen, Aurora, Commerce City
Denver and Boulder. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in
Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
August 2014 service change. Also included in these changes are items changed by amendment of the
initial proposal, through actions of the Board of Directors:

1.B.1.a

Route 6 – East 6th Avenue/North Pecos
This proposal adds a 5:19am eastbound trip from Wewatta/16th to Centrepoint & Sable,

analysis will also be conducted to improve on-time performance. Cost estimated to be
approximately $10,300 annualized.
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron
It is proposed to realign trips after 6:30 p.m. and all day weekends and holiday service to
operate into Civic Center Station. Southbound buses would enter from Broadway,
northbound buses would travel via West Colfax and 15th Street. An additional trip in the
PM peak, leaving southbound at around 5:26pm, from Wagon Road Park-n-Ride is also
proposed to cover a current service gap in the schedule. Saturday running time
adjustments are also needed. Cost estimated to be approximately $10,300 annualized.
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue

reliability. Cost is estimated to be $103,300 annualized.
Route DASH – Boulder/ Lafayette via Louisville
The city of Boulder is installing a traffic signal at South Boulder Road and Manhattan Circle
which will allow us to move the layover/recovery for Route Dash short-turn trips back to
this location. It is therefore proposed to change the current layover from Table Mesa PnR
back to Manhattan Circle, for the DASH short-turn trips. It is also proposed to separate
interlines on Sundays, which will require an additional bus to improve recovery time on the
service. Weekday peak running time adjustments are also proposed. Cost is estimated to

Nine Mile at 7:13 and terminating at I-25 & Broadway at 7:35 with connections to the
7:38 0Ltd and other routes. This will help relieve overcrowding on the 7:04 and 7:19
northbound trips, which are each experiencing Weekday average passenger loads of over
420 and thus nearing Service Standards. This trip would run Mondays-Thursdays, in
conjunction with the new fourth day of service. Anticipated cost is estimated to be
$70,800 annualized.
W-Line – it is proposed to discontinue four of the most unproductive round-trips of the
Weekday: Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:01 AM, 3:00 PM, 3:15 PM,
and 6:45 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 5:40 AM, 2:25 PM, 2:55 PM,
and 6:25 PM. This proposed change effects 355 passengers that will need to take a WLine 7.5 minutes earlier or later. Cost savings are estimated to be -$276,853 annualized.

C/E/F-Line – It is proposed to continue the peak C and E Line service through the midday,
with each line alternating every 30 minutes. The F-Line would also run through the
midday with 30-minute service. This would create a combined 15-minute headway on the
Southeast Corridor between Belleview Station and Lincoln Station.
This proposal
increases connections to and from the W-Line at Auraria West Station and provides more
service to the Auraria at Colfax Station for students at the campus and helps alleviate the
pullin and pullout issues at the end of the morning peak period and before the afternoon
peak period. This operation requires 10 trains instead of the current 6 during the midday.
Anticipated cost is estimated to be $590,000 annualized.

Weeknight (Sunnday-Thursday) Service
D/E/H/W-Line – To provide longer windows for maintenance-of-way it is proposed to
adjust late night and early morning service. Late night service is proposed for changes
Sunday through Thursday nights. This change continues the span of service Sunday
through Thursday nights through 1:00 AM and reduces the frequency from 30 minutes to
60 minutes after 11:00 PM. This proposal will impact approximately 442 passengers on
Sundays and 358 passengers on Mondays-Thursdays.
D-Line - It is proposed to discontinue the 11:30 PM, 12:30 AM, and 1:30 AM southbound
D-Line trips (from 30th & Downing Station) in addition to the 10:46 PM, 11:46 PM, and

(from Lincoln Station).
W-Line - It is proposed to discontinue the 11:32 PM and 12:32 AM westbound W-Line
trips (from Union Station) in addition to the 12:30 AM and 1:15 AM eastbound W-Line
trips (from Jefferson County Government Center - Golden Station).
Total hours saved: 18.58 daily, 4,738.75 annual. Anticipated savings of approximately
$695,000 annualized.

Additional 15-minute Service
D/E/H-Line – It is proposed It is proposed to extend the current 15-minute headways
ending at approximately 9:30 PM from downtown Denver another hour to approximately

C/D-Line – it is proposed to make minor adjustments in running times in both directions
between Mineral Station and I-25 & Broadway and also reschedule the bus connections at
Mineral Station to the Routes 77, 401, 402L, and 403 to improve transfers and make the
service more reliable. No changes in hours proposed.
H-Line – it is proposed to make minor adjustments in running times in the southbound
direction between Dayton Station and Nine Mile Station and also reschedule the bus
connections at Nine Mile Station to the Route 35, 121, 130, 131, 133, 135, and 139 to
improve transfers and make the service more reliable. No changes in hours proposed.
W-Line – it is proposed to adjust running times on the W-Line based on modifications in
regards to the quiet zone crossings. It is anticipated that up to one minute will be saved in
both directions, which will also help with the layover/recovery time at Jefferson County
Government Center Station. This adjustment will save an all-day train on Weekdays and
Saturdays/Sundays.
Total anticipated cost savings is estimated to be -$1,157,000 annualized.

School trippers added/adjusted:
D-Line (train 14), H-Line (train 57). Both are proposed to operate on Monday-Thursday
only, utilizing the new fourth class of service schedule.
Special Services
BroncosRide
It is proposed that RTD discontinue the following RTD BroncosRide Routes for the 2014
season: Federal Center Station BroncosRide and Market Street Station. Alternative for
the Federal Center Station will be the West Line Light Rail. With the closing of Market
Street Station, the Market Street Shuttle would be discontinued. Alternative service will
also be the West Line Light Rail (W-line), Southeast Light Rail (E-Line), operating out of
Union Station.
Due to bus constraints associated with week night games, it is also proposed that RTD
discontinue service to the Alameda & Havana PnR and East High School for weeknight
games only. Currently these two locations do not have preseason service. This proposal
will extend to any regular season weeknight games only. Alameda & Havana alternatives
will include BroncosRide out of South High School or any station along the Southeast Light
Rail Line. East High School alternative will be the Route 15Ltd which is being extended to
the Decatur-Federal Station. Approximately 150 customers will be effected each game.
Savings: Annual Savings -$6,100.

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: May 20, 2014

Subject:

Longmont fare Buy Up Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Boulder County to allow the
County to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route services, herein referenced as “The 300
series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride
services for an initial period of 6 months with options to extend the buy-up period up to two years.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County, in cooperation with the City of Longmont, has requested that they be allowed to “buy up”
all fares on the 300 series routes in Longmont. Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of
the major reasons that ridership has declined in Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective
of this action is to build ridership and prevent future service reductions by the RTD.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County has agreed to reimburse the RTD up to $286,000 on an annual basis (staff estimate is
$210,000 for fixed-route plus approximately $10,000 for ADA annually) for fares on the 300 series routes
and any additional dollars for Access-a-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300
series routes. This dollar amount was established based on 300 series fare revenue from 2012. Originally,
this program request was for a two year period. However, the FTA felt that this would constitute a fare
change and therefore required a fare equity analysis. The program was scaled back to a 6 month
promotional period that would run from July-December 2014. This promotional period is in line with FTA
policy and will not require a fare equity analysis. This request is for a 6 month period but would be extended
an additional 18 months if Boulder County can receive FTA approval. During the dates specified above, there
will be no fare for any passenger boarding any 300 series route. All passengers will be allowed unlimited
boardings on all 300 Series routes, in both directions, throughout the day and throughout the promotional
period. Ridership is currently about 600 boardings per day from previous highs of over 800 boardings per
day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be the same as if passengers were paying fares.
Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law enforcement will continue to have the discretion to
refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued
to any passengers requesting a transfer. This program will not include the Call-n-Ride or regional routes
operating within Longmont. The purpose of the program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The Calln-Ride ridership should not be affected by this program. The County has also agreed that RTD will not be
responsible for any additional operational costs required to stay within RTD service standards should ridership
increases generate a need for additional service; any new cost will be borne by Boulder County. The local
agencies, specifically Boulder County and City of Longmont, will perform the majority of the marketing and
publicity for this program with the approval of RTD Marketing. RTD will promote this program at appropriate
locations on the RTD website. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will hold quarterly meetings to
discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program. Boulder County will take the lead
organizing and hosting these meetings.

CCDC Settlement Baseline Complaint Report

One of the requirements of the CCDC Settlement Agreement is for RTD to “provide CCDC with an Initial
Report. The purpose of the Initial Report will be to determine a data baseline and to assess, in both data
and other subjective evidence available, the effect of the policy and training as required by [the]
Agreement.”
An additional requirement of the Agreement is to provide the Initial Report to the RTD Board of
Directors.
Accordingly, attached to this memo is a copy of the Initial Report. This report provides information on
(1) each incident in which a bus operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button, and (2) each
incident in which a passenger complained that an operator violated the Policy.
The data contained in the Initial Report covers the period from the Effective Date of the Policy (March
22, 2014) through April 30, 2014.

Analysis of CCDC Agreement Securement Area Issues Data

As you are aware, RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Association (CCDC) entered into
a joint Settlement Agreement in an effort to resolve issues related to availability of the
securement area on board RTD buses for passengers who use mobility aids. One of the
requirements of the Settlement Agreement was for RTD to adopt a policy to ensure
individuals who use mobility aids, including wheelchairs, have equal access to its buses
and to the securement area. The key components of this policy are as follows:






Large items cannot block the aisle of the bus
Large items must be collapsed prior to boarding, and passengers must use the seats
behind the securement area for themselves and their items
If large items cannot be collapsed and stored behind the securement area, those
passengers will not be able to board the bus
Large items must be readily moveable and stowed behind the securement area
Passengers with mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, will be given priority boarding
at bus stops

Starting with the effective date of the policy (March 22, 2014), RTD has been tracking 1)
each incident in which a bus operator presses the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button on board
the bus and 2) each incident in which a passenger complains that an operator has violated
the policy. The data for RTD and the private contractors combined resulted in 161 total
incidents reported for the period. Investigation into each of these incidents showed
several that were duplicates, i.e., the operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button
multiple times thinking he/she would get a quicker response from Dispatch. There were
also several incidents that did not result in a passenger using a mobility aid getting passed
up. In these cases the operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button in error. After
subtracting these incidents from the total number of incidents, the data showed 101
actual incidents either involving a passenger pass up or a complaint about the policy that
was called in to the Telephone Information Center (TIC). Over half of the actual passenger

Customer Service Report (reported to TIC)
 Passenger w/stroller claimed she was disabled
 Video evidence did not support complaint
 Passenger claimed back brace was a mobility aid
 Passenger w/large bags refused to move
 Operator allowed 3 passengers in wheelchairs on bus
 Passenger w/walker asked to move out of aisle

One additional statistic that was tracked was the number of times an operator pressed the
lower priority “Request To Talk” (RTT) button in order to contact Dispatch regarding a
passenger pass up instead of the high priority “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button. During the
reporting period of 3/22/14 through 4/30/14, operators used the RTT button 14 times.
The routes generating the highest number of “ADA PAX PASS-UP” incidents were as
follows (includes both actual pass up incidents and those identified as “not a pass up
incident”):
Route 16 – 22 incidents
Route 15L – 20 incidents
Route 15 – 15 incidents
Route 0 – 8 incidents
On average, RTD carries approximately 345,000- 350,000 passengers per day. The
average number of operator-related complaints received per month for both RTD and the
private contractors for 2013 was 1,860. 2014 ridership and complaint numbers were not
available at the time of this report.

Resolution No.___, Series of 2014 Related to
the Issuance of RTD Certificates of
Participation

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
BACKGROUND:
The Board adopted Resolution No. 1744 (Series of 2013) on November 26, 2013 expressing its
intent to raise capital to finance the North Metro Rail Line to 124th Avenue through the issuance of
Certificates of Participation (COPs).
DISSCUSSION:
This action item discusses the financing of the North Metro Rail Line project and provides a
Resolution authorizing staff to proceed with issuing COPs to fund the portion of the project between
Denver Union Station and 104th Avenue. The portion of the North Metro Rail Line project between
104th and 124th Avenues is being funded with other funds available to the District including
previously issued FasTracks Sales Tax Revenue Bond proceeds, local government in kind
contributions and RTD unrestricted cash.
The Resolution provides for (a) a principal amount of the Base Rentals payable by the District
pursuant to the Lease of up to $515,000,000 (b) maximum annual amount of Base Rentals payable
in any Fiscal Year of up to $44,000,000 and (c) a maximum net effective interest rate of 6.5%. The
District intends to reimburse itself for certain prior expenditures related to the project with the
proceeds from these COPs as outlined in the Reimbursement Resolution adopted by the Board in
December 2013.
The resolution authorizes staff to determine if obtaining municipal bond insurance for all or a portion
of the 2014A COPs is in the best interests of the District and if so, to select a bond insurer to issue
a municipal bond insurance policy and execute any related documents or agreements required to
obtain the insurance.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
COPs, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a Preliminary
Official Statement, Ground Lease, Lease, Continuing Disclosure Agreement, Certificate Purchase
Agreement, Indenture and the Certificate Resolution. The Board is being requested, through the
Certificate Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the parameters and to approve
agreements required in connection with the issuance of the COPs.

2.B.1

Drafts of documents in substantially final form referenced in the Certificate Resolution including the
Preliminary Official Statement, Ground Lease, Lease, Continuing Disclosure Agreement, Certificate
Purchase Agreement and Indenture are available for review in the Board Office.
The Chief Financial Officer has also hosted meetings with Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch to
provide an overview of the plan of finance for the North Metro Rail Line. A credit rating has been
requested from each of the three rating agency for these COPs.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisor, Butler
Snow LLP as Bond Counsel and Hogan Lovells and Bookhardt & O’Toole as Co-Disclosure Counsel in
regard to the COPs. The COPs will be underwritten by a team including J.P. Morgan (55%), Piper
Jaffray (15%), BMO Capital Markets (15%), Loop Capital Markets (10%) and Harvestons Securities
(5%).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the financing are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and
miscellaneous costs. Total costs of issuance are expected to be approximately $2.7 million.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2014, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2014, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Certificates of Participation, Series 2014A.
This is not the recommended action.

Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the

current fiscal year. The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to
the 2014A Certificates except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in
the Lease) and certain other payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by
the District in accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Ground Lease, the Lease
nor the 2014A Certificates shall constitute a mandatory charge or requirement of the District in
any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general
obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within

indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond those budgeted and appropriated
for the District’s then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the Leased Property and do not
exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to renew
the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the Corporation’s interest in the Leased Property

pursuant to the Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which
the District has an option to purchase the Corporation’s interest in the Leased Property (i.e., the
entire maximum term of the Lease) does not exceed the useful life of the Leased Property.
Section 9.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2014A Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2014A Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.
Section 10.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are
hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as
reviving any bylaw, order or resolution of the District, or part thereof, heretofore repealed.
Section 12.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or
provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.
Section 13.
Effective Date. This Resolution shall be in full force and effect
immediately upon its passage and adoption.

Subject:

Acceptance of 2013 Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The District is also
required to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual
documents. The accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2013 audit. In addition to the
requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the
federal Single Audit Act of 1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
A confidential electronic copy of the 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) has been
included in MinuteTraq. Bound copies will be provided at the meeting on May 20. We have been
advised by the auditor’s that the financial statements in the enclosed CAFR present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the District as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its
operations and its cash flow for the 2013 and 2012 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is the recommended action, state statutes and other sources, such as
rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited financial
statements into the record.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2013 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District’s independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources,
such as rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited
financial statements into the record.

First Quarter 2014 Investment Report

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the first quarter of 2014 attached.
The U.S. economy expanded modestly (0.1 percent) during the first quarter of 2014. The unemployment
rate declined modestly over the period to 6.7% but still remains elevated and general inflationary
pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy and leave the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the first
quarter noting that this level will continue to be appropriate “for a considerable time after the asset
purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2
percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”

The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

2.C.1

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the first quarter of 2013 was 0.20% which
would produce annualized earnings of $573,719 million. The current return for the month of March was
0.21%.

IN-KIND IGAs
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-12-09

IGAs are a common method used by neighboring jurisdictions to cooperate with one
another. The most common form of IGA involves a formal contract for services. One
government agrees to provide a service to another for some form of return including
cash or service exchange without any payment. In addition governments may also enter
into various types of service exchanges under which participating partners agree to lend
services to one another, generally without any payment being required. This Audit was
selected by the Auditors.
SCOPE
The Audit will include review of a sample of In-Kind IGAs in which RTD takes the lead
as well as IGAs in which RTD is a participant or partner.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:






Determine whether In-Kind services provided by various IGAs were appropriate.
Determine whether In-Kind services were provided.
Determine whether the In-Kind services were fairly valued.
Ensure that the participants are complying with the terms of the agreements.
Ensure that the agreements are formally signed by all participants.
CONCLUSION

The process for In-Kind IGAs is very complicated. Staff at RTD and FasTracks does an
excellent job of preparation and negotiation to ensure that the benefit is mutual. The
policies and procedures should be updated to include, in full detail, how the final IGA is
determined. The conduct of the meetings should also be documented including a list of
those whose presence is necessary.
Management committed to having the Manual updated this year by December 31.

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

2.C.3.a

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 MANSFIELD FUEL CONTRACT
AUDIT REPORT # 14-02-01

RTD contracted with Mansfield Oil Company of Gainesville, Inc. to supply three types of
diesel fuel for RTD buses. The contract was signed in December 2012 with prices that
would be in effect for calendar year 2013. The document includes a ‘not to exceed’
amount of $17 million for the twelve month period.
Fuel is delivered by local transport companies to various RTD sites and deposited into
designed storage tanks. Deliveries are generally between 7,000 and 7,500 gallons each
and are ordered by RTD supply clerks who also monitor storage tanks to ensure that
RTD does not run out of fuel.
AUDIT SCOPE

Our review included the process to develop an RFP within RTD, obtain and evaluate
proposals from firms expressing an interest in bidding, and selecting the winning
contractor. We also reviewed the controls over RTD fuel ordering, receiving, and
invoice processing during the second half of 2013.
CONCLUSION

The contract award process was appropriately followed as an RFP was prepared,
newspaper advertisement was provided, and numerous companies were individually
contacted by RTD Procurement. The selection of Mansfield Oil was properly justified.
Our testing of paid invoices indicated that fuel charges were in agreement with contract
pricing and invoices were appropriately approved at RTD before issuing payment.
However, we have suggested that the present process to review, approve, and pay
invoices be analyzed in an effort to improve efficiency and timeliness of payment.
CURRENT STATUS

Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.
