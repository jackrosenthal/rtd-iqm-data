BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Public Opinion Polling Presentation

May 14, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
Discussion by the Board of Directors during its March 25, 2023, Retreat resulted in a policy goal to
shore up RTD’s financial position and outlook with a policy goal to create a long-term, sustainable, and
resilient funding model. During the May 9, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, Director Erik
Davidson and the Chief Financial Officer presented a Discussion Item regarding a Board revenue
diversification policy goal. To support the Board’s policy goal, on August 22, 2023, the General Manager
and CEO (GM/CEO) informed the Board via memorandum that a cross-matrix Revenue Diversification
Working Group (RDWG) was formed. Following a Discussion Item at the September 12, 2023, Finance
and Planning Committee meeting regarding the need to investigate revenue diversification and other
financial risk mitigation strategies, the RDWG began meeting in October 2023.
The RDWG is charged with making informed recommendations to the Board regarding opportunities for
revenue diversification, fiscal policy enhancements, and other financial measures to support the longterm fiscal sustainability of RTD in accordance with the Strategic Priority of Financial Success. This
includes an assessment of means to address possible financial impacts to RTD related to the Taxpayer’s
Bill of Rights (TABOR). One potential strategy to ensure the agency’s financial sustainability is a ballot
measure that would continue the authorization originally approved by voters in 1999 for RTD to retain
sales and use tax and other revenues (ballot measure) without imposing a new tax or increasing the tax
rate.
On September 26, 2023, the Board approved a summary scope of work and authorized the GM/CEO to
enter into a contract for consulting services for strategic advice, development of a survey instrument,
and public opinion polling related to revenue diversification and RTD finances to garner an understanding
of public opinion related to a potential ballot measure. RTD contracted with New Bridge Strategy.
DISCUSSION
During the Finance and Planning Committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 14, 2024,
representatives from New Bridge Strategy will present information and key findings from the public
polling, including core perceptions of RTD and reactions to a potential ballot measure. The information
being compiled by the RDWG and the polling results presented by New Bridge Strategy are exploratory,

Packet Pg. 3

and no decisions have been made on what, if any, funding avenues to pursue, including whether to
submit a ballot question to registered voters in a future election.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Discussion Item.

Methodology

New Bridge Strategy conducted a survey among N=600 Colorado registered voters
from April 17-23, 2024.
Interviews were conducted via live telephone interviews (both cell phones and
landlines) and online. Interviews were distributed proportionally throughout the
District. Quotas were set for key demographic sub-groups, such as gender, age
and ethnicity.
The survey was also translated into Spanish by GP&P Communications Consulting
and respondents had the option of taking the survey in either English or Spanish.
The margin of error is +4.0% for the overall sample. The margin of error will vary
for sub-groups.

It’s critical that we continue to provide more transit options to relieve the pressure on our roads
and highways. Without mass transit options provided by RTD, our roads and highways will only
get more crowded and congested, impacting driving times for everyone in the area.

less money spent buying gasoline.

Every county in the Denver metro area received a grade of F for failing by the American Lung

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR)

May 14, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
TABOR is a 1992 voter-approved amendment to the Colorado Constitution that generally limits the
amount of revenue Colorado governments can retain and spend. TABOR requires voter approval to
increase taxes or retain excess revenues as well as to issue new certain multi-year obligations such as
bond debt.
TABOR allows governments to retain and spend an annual amount based on the prior year’s actual
revenue or TABOR limit, whichever is lower. For RTD, the TABOR annual revenue growth limit is
determined by the sum of the change in the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus
the net change in new property construction or by actual prior year revenue, whichever is lower.
Revenues collected in a fiscal year that exceed these limits must be returned to taxpayers.
Colorado governments can and have implemented voter-approved exemptions from some or all TABOR
limitations, generally for a fixed period of time. Exemption from TABOR is referred to as being “deBruced” in reference to the author of the TABOR constitutional amendment, Douglas Bruce.
In 1995, District voters exempted RTD from TABOR’s limitations through 2005. In 1999, District voters
further exempted RTD from TABOR’s limitations through the period required to pay bond debt issued to
finance the construction of certain light rail lines but not past 2026. This voter-approved structure that
includes the 0.6% RTD sales and use tax and is referred to as the Base System. The Base System bond
debt will be fully repaid in November 2024 which will subject all of the TABOR-applicable Base System
revenue to TABOR growth limitations beginning in 2025.
In 2004, District voters authorized RTD to collect an additional 0.4% sales and use tax for the FasTracks
Project. Approval of this ballot measure also authorized RTD to issue a fixed amount of FasTracks bond
debt to finance the construction of the FasTracks transit expansion elements. The approved ballot
measure requires the “sunsetting” of any excess FasTracks sales and use taxes collected, after the debt
is repaid, to the extent that only an amount necessary to operate and maintain these FasTracks elements
is retained. The FasTracks debt will be repaid in 2050. Further, the FasTracks voter authorization only

Packet Pg. 38

1.F.1

applies to the 0.4% sales and use tax resulting in all other TABOR-applicable FasTracks revenues being
subject to TABOR limitations in 2025 in addition to the Base System revenues.
All of RTD’s TABOR applicable revenues, except the 0.4% FasTracks sales and use tax, will establish
the basis for calculating revenue limits for 2025.
DISCUSSION
Consideration of this item demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the Strategic Priority of Financial
Success. The purpose of this Discussion Item is to provide the Board with information regarding TABOR
and its potential financial impacts to RTD in anticipation of staff presenting recommended actions in the
coming months to mitigate TABOR ramifications.
The attached presentation materials provide additional information regarding TABOR’s impact to RTD as
well as potential mitigation options for consideration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this Discussion Item.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis and Mid-Year Program
Evaluation of Zero Fare for Youth Pilot

May 14, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides recipients of financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In this circular,
the FTA requires transit agencies, such as RTD, to evaluate fare changes, prior to implementation, to
determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or lowincome populations. The FTA defines a fare change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in
the price of fare media, creation of new fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare
media are defined as forms of payment for transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.). The Zero
Fare for Youth (ZFY) program includes a proposed fare change that meet this definition. Thus, an
analysis is required to be brought before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Fare Equity
Analysis report is included in Attachment A.
RTD’s Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Policies
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. On May 24, 2022, the Board approved and adopted the Title VI Program
Update and required policies. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating
fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which difference
shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is
defined as all persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.
Disproportionate Burden Analysis
A disproportionate burden analysis is an examination of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed
by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes,
which difference shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership.

Packet Pg. 54

1.F.2

A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150% of the Department of
Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects. The agency will then analyze the
modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a
less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate
justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed
change.
DISCUSSION
On July 25, 2023, the Board approved a new fare structure, policies and programs that included one
year of zero-fare transit for youth throughout the district. The fare changes were developed as part of
RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project, a yearlong review aimed at creating a fare
structure that is more equitable, affordable, and simple. Most of the fare changes were implemented in
January 2024.
The ZFY pilot program was made available for youth customers starting September 1,2023, through
August 31, 2024. Individuals 19 of age and younger, regardless of residency or school enrollment, are
eligible for participation in the pilot. Absent this pilot program, RTD collects a fare for children and youth
ages 6-19. Hence, funding for this one-year pilot program was included in the Board-approved budget.
For long-term sustainability, RTD is seeking funding partners to support the continuation of the program
after the pilot.
In January 2024, Colorado lawmakers introduced Senate Bill (SB) 24-032, Methods to Increase the Use
of Transit. Section 3 of SB 24-032 seeks to establish a new grant program that would allow Coloradans
ages 19 and younger to ride for zero fare year-round on services provided by regional transportation
districts and transit associations. As of the date this report was prepared, the bill had not yet been
passed by the General Assembly. Should the bill be signed into law, RTD will be positioned to apply for
grant funding in July 2024 to secure monies for the adoption of this zero-fare program. RTD would
proceed with final public engagement and a public hearing to be held between May 2024 and June
2024. In turn, staff will bring the ZFY program as a formal fare change proposal to the Board in July
2024 for its consideration.
The following discussion is divided into three sections:
• Draft Title VI fare equity analysis
• Public outreach and engagement efforts
• Mid-year program evaluative summary
Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis
Per the FTA, promotional fare reductions or pilots are excluded from being subject to a fare equity
analysis if the pilot does not last longer than six months. On June 22, 2023, FTA officials approved
RTD’s request to extend the pilot beyond the six-month period permitted under current federal regulation

Packet Pg. 55

1.F.2

to a 12-month period, through the end of the 2023-2024 school year and concluding August 31, 2024.
If ZFY is sought to be adopted beyond the pilot period, a fare equity analysis is required to be completed
prior to the fare change and would require Board approval.
In accordance with Title VI and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD conducted an equity analysis of the ZFY
program to ensure that the change in fare policy does not unfairly impact people of color and low-income
populations. The analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride complementary paratransit
services, as they are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements. However, individuals 19
years of age or younger who are certified to use Access-a-Ride are eligible for zero-fare transit under
ZFY.
Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD must analyze any available information generated
from passenger surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately
more likely to use the mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the
fare change.
Based on the Federal Guidance and RTD’s Title VI Policies, RTD must:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed
Review fares before the change and after the change
Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users

A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change
as well as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a
determination is made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are
disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also
used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit the overall population, including
non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Summary of Findings
• Disparate Impact Analysis: The analysis found that minority customers are expected to
experience a greater average fare decrease compared to all customers. While both groups
experience a decrease in their average fare, minority customers are expected to benefit
somewhat more than all customers as a result of the proposed fare change. Therefore, the
proposed fare changes do not present a Disparate Impact.
•

Disproportionate Burden Analysis: The analysis found that low-income customers are expected to
experience a greater average fare decrease compared to all customers. While both groups
experience a decrease in their average fare, low-income customers are expected to benefit

Packet Pg. 56

1.F.2

somewhat more than all customers as a result of the proposed fare change. Therefore, the
proposed fare changes do not present a Disproportionate Burden.
Conclusions
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI
Policies. Additionally, minority and low-income customers benefit more than the overall population. As a
whole, minority and low-income populations experience a greater decrease in their average fare than the
overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 5.2% decrease in their average fare per
boarding and low-income customers experience a 5.1% decrease, compared with a 4.2% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population. No groups are anticipated to see an increase in their
average fare with the proposed change. As such, no mitigations are needed in order to proceed with the
establishment of a longer-term ZFY program following the conclusion of the pilot.
Public Outreach and Engagement Efforts
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter III.5-8, RTD must promote inclusive public participation,
provide meaningful access to limited English proficient persons, and perform appropriate methods to
facilitate the public comment and community engagement process. The current and planned public
engagement activities and public hearings comport with the federal guidelines and are illustrated in
Section 7 of the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report.
Mid-year Program Evaluative Summary
An evaluation of the ZFY pilot is necessary to determine the effectiveness of this program and to
understand impacts of the proposed fare policy change developed for youth customers. This in-progress
review of the pilot program documents the analysis completed to date and will assist in program
reporting.
Beginning September 1, 2023, through February 29, 2024, bus operators manually recorded the total
number of youth customers they observed boarding with a specially recoded button in the electronic
farebox system (farebox). This data was tabulated by route, month, and operating division and resulted
in an estimated monthly count of youth customers on 98 bus routes (there were 113 routes operating in
the September 2023 schedule and 109 operating in the January 2024 schedule). Systemwide fixedroute bus boardings for the same time period as the farebox counts were reviewed to allow for a
comparison of youth counts to total bus ridership.
The data collected thus far, while only estimates, has provided valuable insights into the number of
youth customers by route. Because of the unique way the data has been manually collected through the
Farebox system, some youth customer counts could not be associated by route. These counts are still
reported within the total counts by month and are still included in the presentation of totals.
Error! Reference source not found. shows the total observations of youth customers from September 1,
2023, through February 29, 2024. Observations of youth customers trend upward against general
ridership data that show decreases from summer into winter before increasing again in spring. The
observed youth counts see ridership increases nearly every month except for December, which is

Packet Pg. 57

1.F.2

historically and generally the lowest month of ridership (schools also observe two weeks of break during
this time).

At the commencement of the observation period, youth boardings began at around 105,000 and ended
at nearly 165,000, representing a 57% increase. The observations would indicate more awareness
among youth of RTD’s zero fares, increasing recordings of youth by operators, or both. The SKIP saw
over 11,300 average monthly youth boardings. Several other routes with the highest average of youth
boardings s were in the east metro area including Colfax Avenue routes 15 and 15L and routes 105,
121, and 153 in Aurora.
Nearly all of the 10 routes with the highest observed youth ridership serve both high minority and/or
high low-income populations. Route populations within one quarter mile of route bus stops are used to
determine equity populations. Table 1 indicates the top 10 bus routes with targeted school schedules
and high youth ridership are also nearly all equity routes based on their underlying demographics. Blue
percentages represent equity populations above the system average of 37.5% for minorities and 14.2%
for low-income population based on American Community Survey (ACS) 2018-2022 five-year estimates.

1 Introduction
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”) ensures that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The Regional Transportation
District (“RTD” or “The District”) has committed to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI objectives set
forth in Circular 4702.1B, ensuring that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are
equitably distributed without regard to race, color or national origin.
On June 2, 2023, RTD formally requested authorization to proceed with a 12-month Zero Fare for Youth pilot, as
well as a time extension for completing a fare equity analysis of a potential permanent Zero Fare for Youth change
since the pilot extends beyond the normal six-month period allowed under Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
rules. The FTA approved RTD's Title VI Fare Equity Analysis extension request on June 22, 2023, in order to ensure
all critical tasks associated with the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program were completed. This analysis of the Zero
Fare for Youth program was prepared in conformity with the guidelines laid out in Chapter IV and Appendix K of
FTA Circular 4702.1B, Service and Fare Equity Analysis Questionnaire Checklist.
The Fare Equity Analysis described herein assesses whether the proposed fare changes for fixed-route services
would result in either Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. The proposed fare changes being presented by RTD are the basis of this Fare Equity Analysis. The
analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride services, which provide complementary paratransit
services within the RTD service area, as they are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The Average Fare Analysis conducted as part of this Fare Equity Analysis found that the proposed fare change
would not result in a Disparate Impact on minority customers or Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. Given that there were no findings of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden, no mitigations are
needed to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare change.

2 Overview of Proposed Fare Change
On July 25, 2023, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new fare structure, policies and programs that included
the one year of no-cost transit for youth throughout the district. The fare changes1 were developed as part of
RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project, a yearlong review aimed at creating a fare structure
that is more equitable, affordable and simple. Most of the fare changes were implemented in early 2024.
The Zero Fare for Youth pilot program was made available for youth customers September 2023 through August
2024. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency or school enrollment, are eligible for participation in
the pilot. RTD is funding the financial impact resulting from implementation of a Zero Fare for Youth pilot program
for the first year. For long-term sustainability, RTD is seeking funding partners to support the continuation of the
program after the pilot. RTD will be positioned to adopt this zero-fare offering if funding is secured. Thereby, the
zero fare for youth program will be brought forward as a fare change proposal in June 2024. Final public
engagement and a public hearing is scheduled to be held between May 2024 and June 2024.

3 Title VI Policies
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 601 states:
“No persons in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
It is RTD’s objective to avoid, minimize or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority and
low-income populations. As a recipient of financial assistance from the FTA, RTD is required to comply with Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its own Title VI Program adopted in accordance with same by evaluating
major service and fare changes at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those changes
have discriminatory impacts, including Disparate Impacts on minority populations and/or Disproportionate
Burdens on low-income populations.
According to the Federal Department of Transportation, equity in the provision of transit service is "providing
equal levels of service to minority and non-minority residents of the urbanized area. Levels of service, in turn, are
defined in terms of capital allocation and accessibility." 2 The metrics of discrimination that could be monitored
for disparate treatment include fare structures that could consistently cause minority-group customers to bear a
higher fare burden than the overall riding public, access to specialized fare media, or methods of communication
to populations with Limited English Proficiency. However, a Title VI Equity Analysis should not replace good
program planning, which should be an on-going process that considers equity among other factors when designing
fare changes, service changes, or discretionary policies and programs.
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate
Burden Policy for evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. As part of the 2022
Title VI Program Update, RTD maintained their 5% threshold for determining a Disparate Impact or
Disproportionate Burden of a fare modification as established in RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact Policy and
Disproportionate Burden Policy. The Board of Directors adopted the Title VI Policies concurrent with the adoption
of their 2022 Title VI Program Update. The policies used by RTD for analysis of proposed fare changes is found in
Section 3.1.

3.1 Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policies
The FTA requires that transit agencies assess whether a proposed fare change or major service change would have
a “Disparate Impact” on minority populations, or “Disproportionate Burden” on low-income populations, under
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 49 C.F.R. Section 21.5(b)(2) and (b)(7), and Appendix C to Title 49 C.F.R.
part 21. Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, FTA requires public transit agencies operating 50 or more fixed route
vehicles in peak service and located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, to clearly establish, with input
through a public engagement process, threshold definitions for measuring Disparate Impacts and
Disproportionate Burdens.

1.F.2.a
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies establish threshold standards for evaluating
the equity impacts and the distribution of adverse effects caused by any fare change or major service change.
These thresholds enable RTD to determine whether minority and low-income customers would be
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of the proposed changes and by inference, whether the overall
ridership would disproportionately benefit from the proposed changes when compared to the protected
populations (minority and low-income). These thresholds are based on the cumulative impact of the proposed
service or fare change.
The policies and their applicable analyses and thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
●

Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which shall not be
greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is defined as all
persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

●

Disproportionate Burden
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare
changes, which shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. A
low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of
Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

3.1.1 Fare Changes
RTD defines a fare change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation
of new fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare Media are defined as forms of payment for
transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.).
Based on federal guidance, prior to adopting a fare change, RTD must conduct a fare equity analysis and analyze
specific elements of the proposed structure and changes to fare media along with the recommended pricing
schema, to determine whether the changes would result in impacts that exceed the threshold established by the
policies. As referenced in C4702.1B, some fare changes are excluded from being the subject of a Fare Equity
Analysis, such as instances where all passengers ride free such as “Spare the Air Days”, or temporary fare
reductions that are mitigating measures for other activities such as construction, or promotional fare reductions,
so long as the temporary fare reduction or promotional reduction does not last longer than six months.

3.1.2 Adverse Effects
For the fare equity analysis, adverse effects include an increase in cost or a reduction in accessibility of fare media.
Benefits include a decrease in cost, increase in discounts for certain fare types or customer populations, or
increase in accessibility of fare media. The results of analysis provided in this report uses RTD’s adopted thresholds
for determining Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burdens.

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

4 Fare Equity Analysis Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, or on certain transit modes,
or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated from passenger
surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately more likely to use the
mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the fare change.
The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely affected
by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., non-minority or nonlow-income) who are adversely affected. 3 In accordance with RTD Title VI Policies, the determination of a Fare
Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden is based on the difference in the impacts experienced by minority
and low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes compared to
the impacts experienced by the overall ridership.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
(i) Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
(ii) Review fares before the change and after the change;
(iii) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
(iv) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users. 4
A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change as well
as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a determination is
made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are disproportionately borne by the minority
or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also used to assess whether the proposed changes
disproportionately benefit the overall population, including non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Throughout the document, the following definitions are used:
●
●

●

Fare payment type is defined as fare product (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass) and fare media on which it is
distributed (i.e., cash, paper, electronic)
Fare levels include Local, Regional and Airport. Whether the Local or Regional fare level applies is based
on the number of zones traveled on rail and distance traveled on bus. The Airport fare level applies to any
trip to or from Denver International Airport, regardless of distance, on the A Line, SkyRide or Express bus.
Fare-paying rider categories include full fare customers, seniors 65+, individuals with disabilities, Medicare
recipients, LiVE customers and youth aged 19 and younger.

This report provides the results of the Average Fare Analysis undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed
fare changes on the average fare paid per boarding to determine whether minority or low-income customers are
disproportionately adversely impacted by the changes or whether overall customers disproportionately benefit
from the changes.

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

4.1 Average Fare Analysis
The Average Fare Analysis for the proposed changes was undertaken using ticket sales and revenue data from
calendar year 2021, when ridership was continuing to recover from the COVID pandemic. Ridership by fare
payment type was estimated based on ticket sales and revenue data as well as transfer and fare product usage
rates developed using the 2017 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2017 CSS). The 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction
Survey (2019 CSS) was used for the customer demographic data. While the 2019 CSS sample size was smaller than
the 2017 CSS, it provides demographic data on electronic fare adoption, which were not available in the 2017 CSS.
The Average Fare Analysis excludes free rides as ridership data for free rides are not available. Free rides include
Access-a-Ride customers on fixed-route and FlexRide services, children ages 5 and younger traveling with a farepaying adult, active duty members of the U.S. military and other customers on the RTD fare exemption list. The
Average Fare Analysis also excludes free rides taken on the MallRide. Further, this Fare Equity Analysis does not
consider the impacts of the proposed changes to Access-A-Ride fares on the average fare paid as paratransit
services are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The only ridership changes considered in the Average Fare Analysis are those associated with the changes in the
average fare per boarding due to pricing changes. The Average Fare Analysis does not assume any ridership
changes due to application of fare elasticities. Fare elasticity is a measure of rider sensitivity to changes in fare
rates and the resulting change in ridership behavior. Elasticity assumptions are essential to modeling anticipated
ridership and fare revenue impacts from fare policy changes, but are often excluded from fare equity analyses.
Fare equity analyses seek to understand the average fare experienced by a segment of customers prior to a fare
change and after a fare change, in order to determine the % change in average fare. This calculation becomes
unnecessarily complex when a customer segment is anticipated to attract new customers to the system or from
other fare products. Therefore, fare elasticity is excluded in order to compare the average fare impacts of the fare
changes on the same segment of customers after the change in pricing and policies.

4.1.1 Demographic Data
For customer demographic data, the analysis relied on the 2019 CSS, the most recent comprehensive, on-board
customer survey undertaken by RTD that provides information on customer demographics and fare payment. The
2019 CSS was undertaken by BBC Research, a contractor hired by RTD, whose research surveyors conducted 3,811
surveys. RTD’s 2017 CSS was considered for use in the analysis instead of the 2019 CSS, given the much larger
sample of completed surveys (9,936). However, the survey included limited customer response data on electronic
fare adoption due to the timing of when the survey was conducted (May 2017) and when electronic fares launched
– MyRide Stored Value (May 2017) and RTD Mobile Tickets App (November 2017).
While the demographics of transit ridership may have changed due to COVID, the 2019 CSS provides the most
comprehensive and recent survey data available of systemwide demographics, and likely provides a conservative
assessment of the impacts of the proposed fare changes on minority and low income customers.

4.1.2 Demographic Assumptions
The 2019 CSS, while comprehensive with a significant number of survey responses, does have some limitations.
Low response rates for some rider categories, fare levels and fare payment types, as well as the absence of some
fare payment options on the survey pose several challenges. The Average Fare Analysis attempts to address the

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

limitations of the data by using demographics for similar rider categories or aggregating responses for different
fare payment types for a specific rider category.
The following demographic assumptions are used in the Average Fare Analysis:
●

Demographics for youth are assumed to align with the demographics of Local full fare customers. The
methodology of the 2019 CSS specifically avoids targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this
customer group is underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the
survey. Due to insufficient survey responses, we consider youth demographics to be similar to those of
their family. Additionally, because 93% of youth boardings are assumed to occur on Local services, youth
demographics are assumed to mirror Local full fare customer demographics.

●

Demographics for full fare customers who are not eligible for a discounted fare or for a pass program are
assumed to vary by fare level (Local, Regional, Airport) and by fare payment type, including whether fares
are paid with electronic fare media (i.e., MyRide Stored Value or Mobile Ticket) for 3-Hour and Day Pass
customers.

●

Demographics for seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients are assumed to vary by
fare level and fare payment type. No distinction in demographics by fare media type is assumed due to
insufficient survey responses. For Airport fares, demographics are aggregated for all fare payment types
due to limited survey responses.

●

Demographics for LiVE customers are assumed not to vary by fare level or fare payment type. The 2020
LiVE Program Survey did not ask respondents about the fare level they typically paid. Responses were
aggregated for all fare payment types as the differences between the fare payment types was minimal.

●

Demographics for expanded LIVE customers are assumed to align with full fare customers with a
household income between 185% and 250% of the federal poverty level who would become eligible for
the LiVE Program. Demographics are assumed to vary by fare level. Demographics are not assumed to
vary by fare payment type due to insufficient survey responses.

●

Demographics for bulk sales are assumed to align with the demographics for all rider categories and fare
payment types for a given fare level.

●

Demographics for pass program customers are assumed to vary by pass program (Business EcoPass,
Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass) and fare level (Local, Regional, Airport).

●

Demographics for Semester Pass are assumed to align with the demographics for CollegePass customers.

Due to insufficient data to support other assumptions, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that overall customers,
minority customers and low-income customers have identical usage rates and transfer rates for a given fare
payment type. This means that for any given fare payment type, it is assumed that overall, minority and lowincome customers will all have the same average fare. To be clear: the analysis only assumes that the average fare
is identical for overall, minority and low-income customers within a given fare payment type; average fares are
assumed to differ across fare payment types (e.g., 3-Hour Pass, Day Pass), rider categories (e.g., full fare, LiVE
customers) and fare levels (i.e., Local, Regional, Airport).

4.1.3 Additional Average Fare Analysis Assumptions

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

programs, where all (or the vast majority) of a business, neighborhood or college are required to participate. By
having a large group of participants with varying levels of utilization of the system under a single contract, RTD
can continue to charge the contracted entity only for those trips that are taken. But when that cost is spread
across a large group of customers, it results in a relatively affordable rate per customer. In all three cases, the
utilization of the system multiplied by a fare rate is the fundamental determinant of contract pricing, although the
specific calculation steps differ slightly for each Pass Program.
With the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth policy, the utilization of younger customers eligible for the Zero
Fare for Youth program is expected to be excluded from the Pass Program pricing calculation, thereby resulting in
a lower contract amount. For a number of the Neighborhood EcoPass contracts and nearly all CollegePass
contracts, this is expected to result in a notable decrease in future contract pricing. For business EcoPass, some
small contract pricing impacts may be felt however past survey data has suggested that the share of participating
employees that are 19 years of age or younger is a relatively small share.
However, the benefits of the lower contract pricing cannot be easily attributed to any given individual because
pass program participants do not pay on a per-boarding basis, and may not pay for their EcoPass at all. For
example, with the CollegePass program, if 30% of a college community was eligible for the Zero Fare for Youth
program, any assessment of equity impacts would need to know whether the College planned to reduce the per
student CollegePass fee by 30% for all participating students (regardless of age) or planned to allow students 19
years of age and under to opt out of the fee, with the remaining students covering the remainder of the contract
amount (which may increase their CollegePass price). Depending on the decision, these can have markedly
different financial outcomes on individual participants, and these decisions fall to the participating colleges, not
to RTD. In the case of business EcoPass, a number of employers fully subsidize the cost of EcoPass and employees
do not pay anything for their use of the transit system; in these cases, any change in EcoPass pricing related to the
introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth program would not have any impact on the per-boarding cost to
employees, it would only impact the overall cost to the employer. Further, with little detail on specific
demographics by contract and by age group, assessing per customer demographic impacts is not possible.
For this reason, the average fare analysis assumes that there are no changes in the average fare for the business
EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass programs. It is likely that at least some participants in these
programs will benefit from lower contract pricing with the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth program over
time however, given that participants in these programs do not pay on a per-boarding basis, that the distribution
of benefits can vary widely across Pass Program participants, and that the demographic makeup of individual Pass
Program contracts is not known, the analysis cannot fairly assess potential changes in the average fare.

5 System Ridership Demographics Overview
The following provides an overview of RTD’s systemwide ridership using data from the 2019 CSS, which is the
most recent onboard survey with the detailed information needed for the Fare Equity Analysis. While other data
sources have been consulted for the Fare Equity Analysis, the 2019 CSS provides the most accurate data for
portraying systemwide ridership demographics.
These demographic statistics were considered in the development of the proposed fare changes in order to
minimize or avoid the potential for changes that would result in Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a
Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers.

5.1 Ethnicity Assumptions
For purposes of the Fare Equity Analysis, minority populations are those who have not identified themselves as
“Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin” on the 2019 CSS. The analysis did not include respondents who refused
to respond to the racial/ethnicity question. Additionally, respondents who did not choose an ethnicity or race yet
submitted a survey response that did not comport with racial/ethnicity designations (e.g., “Human,” “Female
Only,” “Russian”) were assumed to be non-minority. The racial/ethnicity categories in the survey include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

African-American/Black
Asian/Pacific Islander
Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin
Hispanic/Latino
Native American/Indian
Other (please specify)

5.2 Income Assumptions
For purposes of the Disproportionate Burden Policy, RTD defines low-income populations as those whose
household income is at or below 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty
Guidelines (also referred to as federal poverty level). To align with the 2019 CSS, the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines
were used to determine which populations would be considered low-income.
Table 1 provides the 2019 U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines and the corresponding RTD low-income definitions by
household size. Because the 2019 CSS asked both household income and household size, the Fare Equity Analysis
was able to use household size and income to categorize each individual survey respondent accurately using U.S.
HHS Poverty Guidelines. Table 2 presents the income categories used in the 2019 CSS. Because the 2019 CSS
income categories are presented as ranges, all respondents within the income ranges that corresponded to the
150% U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines for income and household size were identified as low-income. This may
overstate the low-income population somewhat, but represents the most inclusive low-income definition. The
analysis did not include those survey respondents who refused to respond to either of the household income and
household size questions, as they could not be properly categorized.

5.3 Ridership Demographics
Figures 1 and 2 provide an overview of systemwide fixed-route ridership by minority and income status for those
who responded to ethnicity and income related questions, excluding those who refused to respond to ethnicity
or income questions. For purposes of the analysis, minority status is characterized as anyone who responded to
anything other than only “Caucasian/White.” Low-income status was determined through a cross tabulation of
household income and size, matching the income to 150% of the U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines, as discussed above.
It should be noted that for purposes of this Fare Equity Analysis, low-income customers are defined as those at or
below 150% of the federal poverty level. This is different from the current RTD definition for income eligibility for
the income-based LiVE Program, which is set at or below 185% of the federal poverty level for adults ages 20-64.

Figure 2: Ridership Income

To support the Fare Equity Analysis, cross-tabulations of the 2019 CSS were performed for those who responded
to ethnicity- and income-related questions to develop a breakdown of demographics by fare payment type.
Because the 2019 CSS was conducted prior to the launch of the LiVE Program, data from the 2020 LiVE Program
Survey and the Average Fare Analysis were used to modify the fare payment profiles to account for the LiVE
Program. Recognizing that various fare changes may impact some protected groups more than others, the
relationship between fare payment type and ethnicity and income was reviewed. Table 3 presents the fare
payment type by minority and income status.

6 Fare Change Proposal
As part of RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project, the public expressed strong support for a zero
fare for youth pilot. Based on this feedback, staff determined it would be beneficial for the pilot to align with the
2023-24 school year. The proposed fare change is summarized below.

6.1 Overview of Proposed Fare Changes
RTD launched a Zero Fare for Youth pilot program for a period of up to 12-months beginning September 1, 2023
and lasting through August 31, 2024. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency, are eligible for
participation in the pilot. Proof of eligibility that would be required to ride free is to be determined. The pilot
would likely be supported by internal RTD funds with potentially some additional support from external funding
partners. A permanent Zero Fare for Youth program would be contingent upon the availability of sustainable,
external funding. At the conclusion of the pilot, if it was not made permanent, youth fares would revert to a 70%
discount on the full fare 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes, as noted in Section 6.1.2.
Because the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program is intended as a pilot, this Fare Equity Analysis and Average Fare
Analysis assumes that the fare pricing for youth ages 19 and younger would remain at a 70% discount of the full
fare before and after the pilot. For details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 4 in
Section 6.2.

7 Fare Proposal Outreach
The following is a summary of themes across the feedback received.

7.1 Fare Study Public Outreach Overview
In the fourth and final phase of public engagement, customers and community members had the opportunity to
provide feedback on the recommended changes to the fare structure, policies and programs through public
comment. The public comment period was open from April 13 to May 24, 2023.
Public comment could be submitted in several formats, including:
●
●
●

Online on the Fare Feedback website, which provided a comprehensive overview of the proposed fare
changes
Written on a paper comment form at Fare Study open houses, station pop-ups and community events
Spoken out loud at one of four virtual public hearings

The public comment form asked for open-ended feedback on three topics: the recommended fare structure,
recommended policies and programs and fare equity (Title VI Analysis). Participants could optionally include their
name, organization with which they were affiliated, and demographic information (including racial and ethnic
background, income, household size and age). A list of organizations represented and a summary of demographic
information of the commenters are included in this summary.

7.2 Zero Fare for Youth Public Outreach Overview
[This section will be completed once public comment has taken place and input is reviewed]
A kickoff media event occurred on August 8, 2023, at the Chestnut Pavilion Denver Union Station with the
following speakers: Debra A. Johnson General Manager and CEO of RTD, Denver Councilwoman Amanda Sawyer,
District 5, Denver Public Schools Board Member Scott Baldermann, District 1, RTD Board Chair Lynn Guissinger,
District O, RTD Board Director Kate Williams, District A.
Staff convened virtual informational meetings with public school districts on August 21, 2023 and August 24, 2023.
These meetings were held with staff representatives from Adams 12, Adams 14, Adams County, Aurora, Boulder
Valley, Brighton, Cherry Creek, Denver, Douglas County, Englewood, Jeffco, Littleton, Mapleton, St. Vrain Valley,
Westminster. The meetings served as an opportunity to provide an overview of the pilot program, seek
administrative support for program evaluation, respond to questions and garner feedback.
RTD implemented a comprehensive marketing and outreach strategy that featured distinctive creative assets to
inform and engage both existing customers and the wider public about the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program. The
multi-faceted approach combined digital and social media, a dedicated webpage 5, in-system assets, public
relations efforts, community engagement, partnerships, and paid media, to effectively communicate the benefits
of public transit while encouraging a positive shift in riding habits in the short and long term. To garner direct
feedback from youth and families, RTD administered surveys, virtually and in-person, between October 16, 2023
and March 15, 2024. The survey consisted of questions about youth and/or family travel behaviors and
experiences using RTD services, thoughts on the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program and general information. The
online survey was available in English and Spanish and offered the chance to win a $25 King Soopers gift card for
up to 20 participants. Appendix A provides the full Zero Fare for Youth Survey Analysis Report.
Staff phoned and emailed 105 private schools, 124 youth-serving organizations, 39 recreation centers and 40
libraries to promote the pilot program, distribute English and Spanish toolkits and disseminate surveys to families
who may be using RTD services during the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program. Outreach to these entities were
carried out in two phases. The first occurred between October-November 2023 and second occurred between
January-February 2024.
Table 6 provides a summary of the outreach events and methods along with the estimated number of participants.

8 Average Fare Analysis Findings
The Average Fare Analysis provides a robust overview of the proposed fare changes. The Average Fare Analysis
analyzes the proposed fare changes described in Section 6, namely the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth
program.
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI Policies. While
changes are targeted specifically to Youth customers, the aggregate, systemwide differences between all
customers and minority customers and between all customers and low-income customers were within the 5%
policy threshold. The proposed fare changes are expected to benefit minority customers and low-income
customers to a greater degree than all customers. As such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the
implementation of the proposed fare changes based on the Average Fare Analysis.

8.1 Average Fare Analysis Results
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Policies, and
notes that minority and low-income customers benefit more than the overall population.
A reason that minority and low-income customers benefit to a greater extent than the overall population in the
Average Fare Analysis is due to the composition of RTD’s customer population and share of ridership by rider
category. The share of Youth customers that are minority and low-income are higher than the other rider
categories. It is important to recognize that a key assumption in the analysis is that Youth customer demographics
align with the demographics of Local, Full Fare customers, as outlined in Section 4.1.2. The methodology of the
2019 CSS specifically avoided targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this customer group is
underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the survey. This leaves open the
possibility that the demographics of Youth customers are different than what was assumed in the analysis, which
would change the results of the Average Fare Analysis. Without any comprehensive survey data on the
demographics of RTD Youth customers, the assumption is used for the Average Fare Analysis.
Appendix B provides the detailed tables that show the average fare for each rider category and fare payment type
under the current and proposed fare structure. A summary overview of the findings resulting from the change,
including the Average Fare per Boarding, Absolute Change and Percentage Change are presented in Table 7 with
the following description:
●

Changes that represent a greater percentage decrease than the overall population (i.e., more beneficial
for minority and/or low-income customers) are highlighted in green.

●

Changes that represent a lesser percentage decrease than the overall population (i.e., less beneficial for
minority and/or low-income customers) are highlighted in yellow.

●

Changes that are outside the Disparate Impact/Disproportionate Burden threshold (+5%) are highlighted
in light / deep red.

8.1.1 Key Findings
The key findings are reflected below:
●

When viewing the fare change from a total system perspective, the average fare for the proposed change
is $1.01 per boarding for all customers, $0.92 for minority customers (9% lower than for all customers)
and $0.80 for low-income customers (21% lower than for all customers).

●

As a whole, minority and low-income populations experience a greater decrease in their average fare than
the overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 5.2% decrease in their average fare per
boarding and low-income customers experience a 5.1% decrease, compared with a 4.2% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population.

●

No groups are anticipated to see an increase in their average fare with the proposed changes.

●

As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the analysis assumes no change in the average fare paid by participants in
the three EcoPass programs (business EcoPass, neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass). It is likely that
participants in these programs will eventually benefit from lower contract pricing with the introduction
of the Zero Fare for Youth program, but given that (1) students in these programs do not pay on a perboarding basis, (2) organizations have some discretion as to how to apply contract pricing reductions, and
(3) with little detail on specific demographics by contract and by age group, the analysis cannot fairly
assess potential changes in the average fare. By assuming no change in the average fare for the Pass
Programs, the analysis is likely conservative and understates the fare reduction benefits of the Zero Fare
for Youth program.

8.1.2 Overview of Overall Findings
Table 8 provides the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for minority customers to the overall
customer population. For minority customers, the average fare decreases from $0.97 to $0.92, a 5.2% decrease.
For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.05 to $1.01, a 4.2% decrease. The percentage point
difference between the percentage change for minority customers and all customers is 1%, indicating that
minority customers are expected to benefit somewhat more than all customers as a result of the proposed fare
changes. Applying this difference in average fare changes to RTD’s Disparate Impact Burden threshold, the fare
changes do not represent a Disparate Impact on minority customers as the percentage point difference in
percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5% threshold.

Table 9 presents the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for low-income customers to the overall
customer population. For low-income customers, the average fare decreases from $0.84 to $0.80, a 5.1%
decrease. For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.05 to $1.01, a 4.2% decrease. The percentage
point difference between the percentage change for low-income customers and all customers is less than 1%,

indicating that low-income customers are expected to benefit more than all customers as a result of the proposed

9 Cumulative Findings and Mitigations
Zero Fare for Youth aims to enhance the lives of RTD customers and communities by reducing transportation costs
for families. By inviting youth ages 19 and under to ride the bus and train at no cost, the program seeks to remove
barriers to education and employment, while creating access to destinations across the metro Denver region.
The proposed fare change for a permanent no cost fare for youth ages 19 and under do not appear to create any
Disparate Impacts on minority communities, nor does it appear to create any Disproportionate Burdens on lowincome communities. As such, no mitigations are needed in order to proceed with the implementation of the
proposed fare change.

10 Next Steps
It is important to note that this Fare Equity Analysis represents the impacts associated with the proposed fare
change upon full implementation as adopted by the Board of Directors. As such, should any of the proposed
changes be determined to be technically or administratively unfeasible, a new Fare Equity Analysis would be
required for any proposed changes to the adopted program in order to comply with federal Title VI guidance.
Additionally, if the agency implements the fare change in a way that is inconsistent with what was adopted, the
agency may need to undertake a new Fare Equity Analysis.
[This section will be completed once RTD’s Board of Directors has been made aware and considered this equity
analysis.]

1.F.2.a

Section I: Survey Methodology
The development of the Zero Fare for Youth survey effort began in Summer 2023. Originally, this effort
was to include a pre, mid, and post-test survey of a randomly selected group of students and their
families. To achieve this and considering it would be inappropriate for RTD to have access to school
contact lists, RTD sought out partnerships with numerous local school districts that would facilitate and
administer the survey’s distribution to the selected families. A representative sampling plan (by
enrollment) was developed by RTD and each district was provided with a random number sequence as
well as detailed instructions on how to apply these number sequences to their contact lists to select
the participating families. Unfortunately, engagement with all but one of the district representatives
seemingly ceased upon distribution of the random selection number sequences.
In an attempt to continue the collection of feedback and experiences of youth taking advantage of the
Zero Fare for Youth pilot, RTD decided to distribute this survey instrument to numerous youth-serving
organizations, recreation centers and libraries across RTD’s service area. At this point, the survey
ceased to be randomly selected, and became a self-selection study.
It should be noted that while the data collected in this effort is still valid feedback directly from RTD
customers and youths participating in Zero Fare for Youth pilot, and while general reporting and
comparative analysis can be and was performed on this data, predictive statistical analysis could not
be performed as this study did not contain a random sample of participants.
The survey itself consists of 31 questions and gathered feedback and information on: rider experience,
individual and household transit habits, and personal as well as household demographics. A total of
232 surveys were completed and the reporting and analysis of the survey responses are provided in
the next section.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Central Park Station Development Negotiation

May 14, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit-Oriented Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD acquired the property that is now Central Park Station on the A Line from Stapleton Development
Corporation in two phases. In August 2010, RTD acquired the eight acres for $1,057,047. Two years
later, in July 2012, RTD acquired an additional 11.6 acres for $1,585,082. The land was originally
purchased for the Central Park Bus Facility and Park-n-Ride (PnR) and was later incorporated into the
Eagle P3 Project to serve the A Line. RTD purchased the property using Federal grant funds under grant
CO-03-0125. As of 2024, the Bus facility serves as the operating base for nine routes (the 28, 37, 38,
42, 43, 65, 73, 88, and 105) and the PnR contains 1,521 spaces. The PnR is part of RTD’s parking
management system but is not maintained by Denver Transit Operators (DTO) through the Concession
Agreement.
The subject of this discussion item is the PnR’s westernmost parcel, located at the southwest corner of
Smith Road and Ulster Street (the Property). The six-acre Property has 651 transit parking spaces with
very low parking utilization and very high development potential. In February 2023, Ulysses
Development Group (UDG) submitted Step 1 of RTD’s Unsolicited Proposal Process for Joint
Development (UPP), commencing a discussion between the developer and Planning Department staff.
The UPP stems from the 2010 Board-adopted TOD Strategic Plan, which created a more focused policy
that guides RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. That plan
was followed by the Board-approved Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property in 2015, which guides
the UPP that developers must follow to pursue development on RTD property. In 2021, the Board
approved the Equitable TOD Policy, encouraging the development of affordable housing on RTD land.
In June 2023, UDG submitted the second step of the UPP, the Technical Review, proposing to replace
the site’s 651 parking spaces with approximately 800 units of affordable housing and community
amenities. The RTD Technical Review Committee, composed of Operations, Capital Programs, Safety
and Environmental Compliance, Transit Police and Emergency Management, Finance, Legal Services, and
Planning department staff, noted that parking utilization at Central Park stands at less than 30%, and
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had hovered around only 50%. With this information, and with the
certainty that approximately 800 affordable units would generate more customers than 651 empty
parking spaces, the committee agreed that the parking space reduction was appropriate. Finding no fatal

Packet Pg. 145

1.F.3

technical flaws in the proposal, the committee approved the site for potential development, obtained
concurrence from each committee member’s department leader, and notified UDG of the committee’s
findings.
Planning staff then sought concurrence and approval from the General Manager and Chief Executive
Officer (GM/CEO) to terminate the UPP and immediately issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to
develop affordable housing on the site. Departing from the UPP and proactively issuing an RFQ served
two purposes: first, it leveled the playing field by reducing UDG’s head-start on the project; second, it
streamlined the pre-development timeline by reducing the somewhat redundant review that is
purposefully built into the UPP. The UPP is intended for sites that are less desirable because such sites
only pencil under certain conditions and with the right developers. UDG’s proposal review demonstrated
that the Central Park site is more viable than previously thought because of changes in parking
utilization.
The GM/CEO agreed to the new direction, and Planning Department staff worked with the Contracting
and Procurement Division to issue the RFQ in November 2023. After a 90-day solicitation period, the
selection committee conditionally chose UDG based on its ambitious affordable housing program, access
to financial resources, and development experience. To continue to the next step in the joint
development process, RTD must execute an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with UDG.
DISCUSSION
It is staff’s intent to return to the Finance and Planning Committee during its June 2024 meeting with a
recommended action that authorizes the GM/CEO to enter into an ENA with UDG. Should the Board
adopt this recommended action, the agency would operationalize the 2021 Equitable Transit-Oriented
Development Policy and would also further the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Financial Success by creating much-needed housing near transit, improving
transit access, and generating revenues for RTD.
The ENA will address, among other items:
•
•
•
•

Negotiation and design schedule
Project financing
Development plan (density, use, affordability)
RTD maintenance and operations requirements

The ENA will permit a 24-month negotiation period, commencing on the effective date of the ENA.
However, RTD may extend the term of the ENA at its sole discretion.
Board authorization through a future action will be required to lease the Property to UDG and begin
construction. If RTD and UDG do not execute the ENA, are unable to negotiate a ground lease or any
other necessary agreements, or if the Board does not authorize disposition of the Property through a
future action, RTD will remain the property owner and any subsequent decisions regarding the Property
would be subject to Board approval. Staff will keep the Board apprised of the development process.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of the ENA will have no financial impact to RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Return-on-Investment Dashboard

May 14, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the Board’s annual retreat held on February 24, 2024, Board members discussed the concept of
the agency developing a return-on-investment (ROI) dashboard. This dashboard would serve to illustrate
the value of the services delivered/provided to the jurisdictions within RTD’s geographic boundaries in
relation to the sales and use tax dollars collected from those jurisdictions.
In parallel to the ROI dashboard, staff is developing a public-facing agency performance dashboard
(performance dashboard) that will serve as an easily accessible repository for performance data related
to the agency’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan. The performance dashboard will also house information
related to the agency budget and financial reports, people power statistics, and other key
measurements. The performance dashboard will enhance agency transparency and assist the
Performance Committee’s efforts to assess the agency’s progress toward Strategic Plan Success
Outcomes.
DISCUSSION
In keeping with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Financial Success, during the Finance
and Planning Committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 14, 2024, staff will present an update on
the ROI dashboard.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Discussion Item.
