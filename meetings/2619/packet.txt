BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Approval of Bank Signature Authorization

Board Meeting Date: August 15, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).
BACKGROUND
Wells Fargo, as the District’s commercial bank, requires prompt notification of all modifications in the
authorized signatories on the District’s various bank accounts. In order to reflect any changes in District
personnel and the election of new Board officers, the Agreement is updated at least annually and
periodically as otherwise required.
DISCUSSION
The attached recommended Agreement has been modified from the previously approved Agreement only
to reflect the addition of a new checking account which will be used solely for paying invoices related to
the winding down of the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA). Funds deposited in this
account will be transferred to RTD from the DUSPA. The creation and use of this account will enable
RTD to clearly account for the remaining DUSPA funds as DUSPA’s remaining obligations are paid over
time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommended Board action poses no financial impact to the District.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the
“Agreement”).
2.
Modify the attached Agreement.
Do not adopt the attached Agreement.

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the second quarter of 2017 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the second
quarter of 2017. The U.S. unemployment rate declined modestly over the period to 4.4% and general
inflationary pressures remained tame.
In order to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Federal
Reserve chose to raise the target range for the federal funds to 1 to 1.25% in June. The Federal
Reserve stated “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further
improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.”
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

2nd Quarter

RTD cash and cash equivalents:

1.C.1

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the second quarter of 2017 was 1.3% which
would produce annualized earnings of $3,868,784. The current yield for the month of June was 1.42%.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
reflected in the following graph:

Historical performance of RTD Enhanced Cash Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy
benchmark is reflected in the following graph:

Information

The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card which customers load and
reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass
and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All bus installations are complete for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as buses
are purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line, B Line to Westminster
and R Line to Aurora. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge. 191
Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 475,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
July 2017, 1.2M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide portal went
live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the portal was launched to the general public. As of
July 23, 2017, approximately 7,700 cards were issued, of which 5,200 (68%) were full fare cards and
2,500 (32%) were discount cards. The average stored value loaded (initial purchases and reloads) was
$44.80, with a total value loaded of $788,000. There were 183,000 trips taken using these MyRide
cards with a fare payment value of over $517,000. Of these trips: 72% were local, 25% regional and
3% airport.
MyRide Stored Value Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public through the MyRide
web portal. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the
card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales
outlets and at Retail outlets (Safeway and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash
value onto MyRide cards at 50 Safeway retail stores. As of July 1, 2017, customers can load cash
value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores.
As of January 1, 2017, Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc. separated its Business Process Services Unit into
an independent public company called Conduent. Xerox will be referred to as Conduent.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

August 3, 2017

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

January 2018 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals included herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. A
notable modification to Light Rail operations in the Central and Southwest Corridors is proposed in the
creation of the L Line service plan, described later. Also, significant changes in midday and weekend
operations on the R Line and W Light Rail, resulting in service efficiencies, are proposed. Based upon
current and past ridership performance, Routes 42 and 45 are proposed for service reductions to peak
level and weekend service. Additionally, the Route 89 is proposed for discontinuance based on
continued poor ridership performance. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of
these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service
change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Route 16 – West Colfax
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. Cost impacts
are anticipated to be an estimated $27,900 annualized.

2.C.1.c

Route 42 – Montbello via Albrook/Green Valley Ranch
Reduce weekday peak period frequency east of 40th & Airport Station through Green
Valley Ranch from every 15 to every 30 minutes. Peak period productivity through Green
Valley Ranch is 17.4 boardings/hour, versus the 25 boardings/hour needed to justify the
higher frequency. Route 42 all day productivity is 19.4 boardings/hour. Peak frequency
will remain every 15 minutes through Montbello to Central Park Station.
Cost savings are estimated to be $156,000 annualized.
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Blvd.
Running time and trip time adjustments. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 44 – 44th Avenue
Reroute via 48th Avenue to Colorado Blvd and 40th & Colorado Station. Present routing via
Clayton/46th/Steele/43rd/Clayton is very awkward and time consuming, with multiple
railroad crossings, and operating under Interstate 70, which will be torn down for
reconstruction as early as 2018. East 48th Avenue between Columbine and Vasquez Blvd.
is presently served by Route 48, and has existing bus stops. No cost is anticipated for
this change.
Route 45 – Montbello via 51st/Green Valley Ranch
Reduce weekday peak period frequency from every 15 to every 30 minutes, over entire
route. Peak period productivity is 19.5 boardings/hour, versus the minimum productivity
standard of 25 boardings/hour needed to justify the higher frequency. Route 45 all day
productivity is 17.0 boardings/hour.
Cost saving are estimated to be $584,000 annualized.
Route 83D/83L – Parker/Leetsdale Limited
Add Route 83D trips via Dayton and Quebec Way at 9:15am and 11:17am eastbound
from downtown, and 10:09am and 12:09pm westbound from Nine Mile Station. Provides
consistent hourly midday service on 83D routing, extends periods of 15 minute frequency
during the midday to the trunk route on Leetsdale Drive and Speer Boulevard through
Cherry Creek. Additionally, due to insufficient recovery and lengthening running times, add
bus for adequate recovery at Nine Mile Station between 11:00am and 1:30pm.
Cost impacts are estimated to be $78,000 annualized.
Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus
Discontinue route, due to very low ridership. Currently ridership averages 115 boardings
per day, 3 boardings/trip, and 9.7 boardings/in-service hour.
Cost savings are estimated to be $312,000 annualized.
Route 90L – US36 & Sheridan Limited
Route name change to ‘FF7, which would more explicitly incorporate this route into the
Flatiron Flyer service plan. No cost is anticipated for this change.

between RTD and the City of Boulder and/or Boulder County. In addition, it is proposed to
discontinue the current ‘west-end loop’ between Arapahoe/14th St, 9th St, Canyon Blvd
due to very low ridership and instead operate the west-end of the route via 14th Street
between Arapahoe and Canyon Blvd. This will allow for better on-time performance and

required. Route HOP is available along 9th Street and routes 205 and N provide additional
service along Canyon Blvd, between 9th St and Downtown Boulder Station. No cost
impacts are anticipated with this change.

C, D, and L Line proposal:
Previous efforts to improve on time performance on the D Line involved both signal and station
changes along the Welton Street segment, resulting in a 3% improvement in on-time performance.
However, the on-time performance standard for rail remains higher than that achieved by the D
Line service. As a part of further efforts to improve the on-time performance of the Southwest and
Central corridors and as a means of optimizing passenger capacity on both corridors, the following
changes are proposed:
L Line
It is proposed to separate the operation of the D Line into two lines, the D Line and the “L Line”.
The D Line would operate as it does today between Mineral Station and downtown, with all trains
turning at 19th Street. The Welton Street segment would operate as its own service, the L Line,
as previously proposed in the Central Rail Extension Mobility Study. The L Line would operate
between downtown and 30th & Downing Station, with all trains turning at 14th Street. This allows
service to be better tailored to the two different service area segments and will increase reliability
of service along Welton Street, especially in the northbound direction.
C Line
It is proposed to increase the weekday peak service frequency from 30 minutes to 15 minutes and
also run later at night, similar to the E Line. This would serve the growing demand for service
during special events in the Central Platte Valley Corridor. Vehicle consists will be a mix of 2- and
3-car trains, similar to the W Line. It is also proposed to operate the C Line on weekend and holiday
evenings and late nights instead of the D Line; frequencies and span of service on the C Line would
be similar to the existing D Line.
D Line
It is proposed to reduce weekday peak service frequency from an average of 10 minutes to 15
minutes and increase train size from three cars to four cars. The lower frequency during the
weekday peak periods would be replaced by the increase in C Line service and new L Line service.
It is proposed to reduce weekday midday service from 15 minutes to 30 minutes. Weekday midday
service on the Southwest corridor would have a combined 15-minute frequency between the C and
D, similar to the E and F on the Southeast. It is also proposed to reduce evening and late night
service and cover this service with C Line and L Line trips. This proposal responds to ridership
trends, especially on evenings and weekends, for service to the Union Station area, including airport

This proposal has savings in both operating hours and vehicle miles. Total annual car hours saved:
5,100 (approximately 1,800 annual operator hours); total annual car miles saved: 493,400.
E, F, and H Lines: Minor running time adjustments are proposed for the Southeast Lines on all
service days. This will not alter the trips and the same service will be provided. No changes in
hours are anticipated.
Cost savings are anticipated to be an estimated $333,000 annualized

D, E, H, and W Line
It is proposed to reduce late night service Sunday through Thursday nights. The last trips would
depart from downtown Denver after 12:00 AM instead of just after 1:00 AM as they do now.
This impacts one trip on each of these lines for a total average daily boardings of 218 (46 D Line,
49 E Line, 64 H Line, 59 W Line) for Sunday nights and 249 (51 D Line, 57 E Line, 77 H Line, 64
W Line) for Monday-Thursday nights. Total hours saved: 6 Sundays-Thursdays, 1,530 total annual.
Cost savings are anticipated to be an estimated $283,000 annualized.
R Line
It is proposed to reduce service in the off-peak south of the Florida Station. R Line service would
run south of Florida Station approximately between 5-9 AM and 3-6 PM on weekdays only. This
proposal keeps 15-minute service through central Aurora all day, where the maximum per trip
passenger volumes currently occur during the off-peak hours. Denver Tech Center passengers
would still have R Line service in the peak hours and could transfer at Southmoor Station in the
off-peak. This proposal will help increase efficiency (boardings per hour) on the R Line, which
currently averages 41 passengers per hour on weekdays, which is the lowest of all rail lines. Total
hours saved: 15,387 annual hours. Cost savings are anticipated to be estimated $2,830,000
annualized.
W Line
It is proposed to reduce the frequency of service between Jefferson County Government CenterGolden Station and Federal Center Station during the off-peak from 15-minutes to 30-minutes.
These trips currently run every 15 minutes and are not currently meeting service standards. They
have lower boardings per hour (by about half) when compared to the outer ends of the other four
light rail corridors in the off-peak. This would reduce the frequency between 9:00 AM-3:00 PM
and 6:00 PM-9:00 PM Mondays through Fridays and all day on Saturdays and Sundays. During
these times, westbound trains would alternate between terminating at Golden or Federal Center
and eastbound trains would alternate between starting at Golden or Federal Center.
