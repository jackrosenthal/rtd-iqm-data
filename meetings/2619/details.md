#### 1. 2017-005 : Approval of Bank Signature Authorization

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).

BACKGROUND

Wells Fargo, as the District’s commercial bank, requires prompt notification of all modifications in the authorized signatories on the District’s various bank accounts.  In order to reflect any changes in District personnel and the election of new Board officers, the Agreement is updated at least annually and periodically as otherwise required.

DISCUSSION

The attached recommended Agreement has been modified from the previously approved Agreement only to reflect the addition of a new checking account which will be used solely for paying invoices related to the winding down of the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA).  Funds deposited in this account will be transferred to RTD from the DUSPA.  The creation and use of this account will enable RTD to clearly account for the remaining DUSPA funds as DUSPA’s remaining obligations are paid over time.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

This recommended Board action poses no financial impact to the District.
