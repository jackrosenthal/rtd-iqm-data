CRRSAA Grant Award

BACKGROUND
In response to the financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and
Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Twenty-five ($25) billion of
the $2 trillion CARES funding was designated for award by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to
transit agencies resulting in an apportionment to RTD of $232.3 million. This CARES funding was
awarded on a 100% federal share basis with no matching requirement and was required to be used to
sustain transit operations. RTD completed drawing the entire $232.3 million award in December 2020
for reimbursement of employee compensation and purchased transportation costs that were incurred
sustaining RTD’s operations during 2020.
During the second half of 2020, industry-based associations, labor unions and transportation agencies,
including RTD, advocated for additional funding to supplement the CARES Act as a result of the ongoing
financial crisis.
On December 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental
Appropriations Act (CRRSAA), pronounced “Chrissa”, was signed into law. This $2.3 trillion aid
package included $14 billion in supplemental appropriations for transit agencies of which RTD received
notice of its $203.4 million apportionment on January 11, 2021. RTD is currently awaiting specific
guidance from the FTA regarding the requirements and allowable expenditures necessary to draw these
funds; however, it is clear from the legislation that this funding must also be used to sustain transit
operations.
While there is speculation about the Biden administration seeking additional transit funding, RTD’s policy
is to not include or plan for additional funding in its budget or forecasts until such funding is certain and
measurable. Additionally, RTD’s 2021 Fiscal Policy states “RTD will avoid dependence on temporary
revenues to fund ongoing services. One-time revenues will be used for one-time expenditures”.
As further background regarding Board policy regarding funding, the Board adopted the 2021 Fiscal
Policy in November 2020 that includes a section titled “COVID-19 Response Policies”. This section
establishes guidance for restoration of funding, and the uses thereof, as:
• Restore reserves to three months if possible
• Do not utilize existing FISA balances

• Limit the use of, or do not use, future rubber tire service contributions to FISA
• Restore deferred projects related to compliance or safety
• Restore service as ridership allows
DISCUSSION
RTD included the $232.3 million CARES funding in the six-year 2021-2026 Mid-term Financial Plan
(MTFP) forecast that was presented to the RTD Board in November 2020. The Board agreed to approve
only two of the six MTFP years, 2021 and 2022, and declined to approve the forecast for years 20232026 primarily due to the economic uncertainty and volatility resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic.
The Board also approved and appropriated funding for the 2021 Budget in November 2020.
Neither the 2021 Budget nor the 2021-2026 MTFP contemplated additional federal funding after the
2020 CARES funding. As a result, RTD expects to realize annual revenue shortfalls of $100-$150
million through 2026 culminating from a loss of fares and reduction in sales and use tax receipts. In
response, RTD cancelled or delayed capital expenditures and state of good repair projects and
implemented significant expense reductions including service reductions, furloughs, pay reductions,
layoffs and other cost-saving measures to align expenditures with expected revenues.
Through these measures, RTD was able to achieve a forecasted balanced budget on the Base System for
years 2021-2026 but is currently forecasting that it will be unable to balance revenues with
expenditures on FasTracks in years 2025 and 2026 even after exhausting reserves.
The CRRSAA apportionment of $203.4 million to RTD will provide the opportunity for RTD to realize
temporary relief from some of the significant measures taken to reduce and delay expenditures.
RTD’s General Manager and the Senior Leadership Team have been meeting regularly to discuss the
impacts to RTD from the cost reduction actions taken now that the results are being realized and there is
the potential to make course corrections with the availability of the CRRSAA funding.
Moreover, the General Manager has convened a working group comprised of the Acting Chief Financial
Officer, Chief Operations Officer, the Assistant General Manager, Planning and herself to review and
assess CRRSAA funds utilization to optimize and enhance service delivery, as well as assess
recommendations from the Accountability Committee and State Performance Audit.
As of the January 21, 2021, the General Manager, along with the Senior Leadership Team has identified
the following application of funds to be necessary:
•

•

$180,000,000: operations funding to restore service up to $30 million per runboard for six
runboards (two years) beginning with the June 13, 2021 runboard. Service restoration will be
based on the fully-loaded cost per revenue hour amount and provision of service will consider
contracted services.
$4,446,809: estimated cost to restore budgeted overtime and extra shift pay for represented
employees and primarily front line non-represented supervisory employees.

•

$1,734,942: estimated additional budget needed to eliminate tiered 6 days of furloughs in 2021
for non-represented employees. Non-represented employees took 9 furlough days in 2020.
$886,550:
estimated additional budget needed to eliminate tiered 2021 temporary pay
reductions for non-represented employees. Other non-represented compensation reductions such
as lower employer retirement contributions, higher health benefit cost-sharing and elimination of
benefit pay will remain in place.
$2,401,009: estimated cost for non-represented employees to cash out up to 80 hours of PTO,
vacation or sick balances over a certain accrual balance threshold allowed by policy. RTD’s
policy prior to 2021 allowed non-represented employees to cash out up to 80 hours per year.
The 2021 Budget eliminated cash-outs to temporarily conserve cash, however, the liability to
RTD remains and the individual receives a cash-out of accrued balances at termination of
employment.
$13,898,218:
remaining funding available for additional uses such as implementing
recommendations from the Accountability Committee and the State Performance Audit.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total estimated financial impact of the CRRSAA funding is $203,367,528.
