BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
FasTracks Series 2012A Bonds and TIFIA Loan Refunding

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
January 26, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Bond Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Tax –
Exempt and Taxable Refunding Bonds, Series 2021(FasTracks Project).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2010, RTD entered into a Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan
agreement with the United States Department of Transportation to assist in funding the Eagle Project.
The TIFIA loan has an approximately $342 million balance remaining to be paid. The TIFIA loan may be
refunded at any time, there is no optional redemption date (call date) that must be met.
In 2012, RTD issued its FasTracks Series 2012A Sales Tax Bonds to finance the FasTracks Project.
Approximately $475 million of these bonds remain to be paid. These bonds have a 10 year optional
redemption date meaning that a refunding effectuated before the optional redemption date of November
1, 2022 requires that an advance refunding occurs in which taxable bonds, rather than tax-exempt
bonds, be issued.
The approaching optional redemption date and current low interest rate environment have created an
opportunity to refinance these obligations to realize a reduction in interest expense.
DISCUSSION
In order to complete this refunding for interest savings, RTD will issue both a Series 2021A taxable and
Series 2021B tax-exempt bonds. Tax-exempt bonds generally have a lower interest cost, however, a
portion of the refunding does not qualify for tax-exempt bonds since the optional redemption date has
not yet been reached. In order to maximize interest savings on the taxable bonds, RTD will make a
tender offer to current bondholders in which the refunding bonds will make those bondholders whole
while also sharing a portion of the savings to encourage early redemption. In addition, RTD plans to
designate the Refunding bonds as Green Bonds. Green Bonds are issued to finance environmentally
friendly projects and draw additional interest from investors seeking socially responsible investments
thereby creating additional demand for these bonds.
The attached Resolution allows for the refunding of the FasTracks Series 2012A Sales Tax Bonds and
FasTracks TIFIA loan for interest savings. The related contractual documents required to effectuate the
refundings are identified in the Resolution and include:

Resolution No. __ delegates to the General Manager or the Acting Chief Financial Officer the authority
(effective for one year following the date thereof) to determine terms of the Series 2021A refunding
bonds, provided that: (a)
the final maturity of the 2021A Bonds shall be no later than November 1,
2037; and the final maturity of the 2021B Bonds shall be no later than November 1, 2045;
(b)
the net effective interest rate of the 2021A Bonds shall be less than the net effective interest
rate of the Refunded 2012A Bonds; and the net effective interest rate of the 2021B Bonds shall be less
than the combined net effective interest rate of the RTD TIFIA Bond and the Tendered 2012A Bonds;
(c)
the combined maximum annual repayment cost of the Bonds and all other outstanding debt
issued pursuant to the 2004 Election shall not exceed the maximum annual repayment cost authorized in
the notice of election sent to the voters in connection with the 2004 Election;
(d)
the combined debt service requirements of the Bonds and all other outstanding debt issued
pursuant to the 2004 Election, when combined with the debt service requirements previously paid for all
other debt issued pursuant to the 2004 Election, shall not exceed the maximum total repayment cost
authorized at the 2004 Election;
(e)
the net purchase price of the 2021A Bonds shall not be less than 98% of the original principal
amount of the 2021A Bonds; the net purchase price of the 2021B Bonds shall not be less than 98% of
the original principal amount of the 2021B Bonds; provided that in the event that the 2021A Bonds and
the 2021B Bonds are issued at the same time and sold to the same Underwriters, the net purchase price
of the Bonds shall be not less than 98% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Bonds; and
(f)
the net present value savings of the 2021A Refunding Project shall not be less than 3.00% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Refunded 2012A Bonds; and the net present value savings of the
2021B Refunding Project shall not be less than 3.00% of the principal amount of the RTD TIFIA Bond
and the Tendered 2012A Bonds; provided that in the event the 2021A Bonds and the 2021B Bonds are
issued at the same time and both the Refunding Projects are effectuated, the net present value savings
of the combined Refunding Projects shall not be less than 3.00% of the combined aggregate principal
amount of the Refunded 2012A Bonds, the RTD TIFIA Bond and the Tendered 2012A Bonds.
General Manager or the Acting Chief Financial Officer is authorized to make the determination as to the
amount of bonds refunded under the tender offer. Such determinations with respect to the Bonds shall
be set forth in a Sale Certificate to be executed by the General Manager or the Acting Chief Financial
Officer.

1.B.1

RTD is receiving the advice of Hilltop Securities as independent financial advisors, Butler Snow LLP as
bond counsel and Hogan Lovells as disclosure counsel in regard to the transaction. The bonds will be
sold through an underwriting syndicate consisting of Goldman Sachs, RBC, Harveston Securities, and
Stifel.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial market conditions as of November 16, 2020 would create savings to RTD of approximately
$20 million (5.9% net present value savings) for the TIFIA Loan refunding and $56 million (11.8% net
present value savings) for the Series 2012A Sales Tax Revenue Bond (FasTracks Project) refunding.
Costs of the refinancing including professional fees, Green Bond designation and tender agent fees will
be paid from the proceeds of the refunding bonds.
