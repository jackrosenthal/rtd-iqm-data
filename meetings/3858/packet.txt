BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
January 2026 Service Change

November 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
December 2, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the proposed January 2026 Service Change, as summarized in
Attachment A, and authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments necessary to deliver the approved service plan.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Patrick Preusser, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The January 2026 Service Change proposal provides opportunities to adjust and improve the service
plan for RTD’s transit network. Consistent with the work shift selection process outlined in the
Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001, it
also provides employees with the opportunity to select new work assignments.
DISCUSSION
As evidenced in the Five-Year Financial Forecast and the 2026 Proposed Budget, available funding levels
for transit services are estimated to remain the same as provided in 2025. The January 2026 service
change proposal includes small-scale changes to fixed-route bus service and the restoration of rail
service patterns.
Staff are pursuing alternative funding to advance the implementation of the Systems Optimization Plan
and to sustain the system’s recent growth patterns.
The January 2026 Service Change proposal minimizes budgetary impact while addressing service quality
throughout the transit network. Among the more notable changes are:
•
•
•

Rerouting the D Line back to the Downtown Loop via the Central Corridor
Extending the H Line from Southmoor Station to Downtown Loop
Restoration of service on L Line from 30th/Downing to 16th/Stout stations

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

Building on the 2021–2026 Strategic Plan, particularly the goal of Customer Excellence, the proposals
focus on improving on-time performance, maintaining compliance with the CBA, and adjusting service
levels to align with ridership demand
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
The service changes summarized below are further detailed in Attachment A.
Summary of Public Outreach
Between October 16 and October 30, 2025, a public comment period was held to gather input on the
recommended January 2026 service changes. Public meetings were held via Zoom (virtual), and an
updated feedback process was employed to collect customer input by impacted route or line. It should
be noted that the public outreach concluded on October 30, 2025. While the documents detailing the
public outreach outcomes are not yet available as attachments, they will be provided shortly after
October 30. Written communications, survey data, and public comments collected during this public
comment period have been summarized and listed in Attachments K and L of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receive input during the public comment process and perform additional analysis after the initial
service modifications are communicated to the Board. Based on the results of the public comment
process and ongoing analysis, staff may recommend further adjustments to the initial modifications. The
following modifications have been added or significantly revised:
Route 0 – Broadway: schedule adjustments to improve weekday and Saturday on-time performance
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue: additional eastbound trip departing Auraria Campus at 3:44 p.m. added to
address passenger volumes on the 3:29 p.m. trip due to a growing number of boardings at 6th Avenue –
Clermont
Platte Valley FlexRide: proposed service discontinuance postponed, to take place as part of the May
2026 service change

Anticipated cost: None
FMR – Free MetroRide
Running times adjusted to improve weekday on-time performance.

Longmont Routes
With the reopening of the Coffman Corridor following reconstruction, between 9th Avenue
and 3rd Avenue, it is recommended to extend operations of regional routes BOLT, LD and
LX back to Coffman Street, between 9th Avenue and 3rdd Avenue, serving the 8th and
Coffman Park-n-Ride instead of Bross/8th Street. This will result in activating the newly built
corridor by City of Longmont and allow for better on-time performance of these routes, as
well as adjusted running times for BOLT, LD and LX, and local routes 323, 324, 326, and
327.
Anticipated cost: None

FlexRide Service
Platte Valley FlexRide
Recognizing continued low customer utilization, it is recommended to discontinue operation
of the Platte Valley FlexRide. Current utilization averages less than .6 passengers per hour
or 8 passengers per day. The service was implemented in August 2019 as a replacement
for an underperforming fixed-route service (Route 33 - Platte Valley). Alternative service to
the Platte Valley FlexRide can be found on the Denver Connector West service, which
overlaps a significant portion of the FlexRide service area.
Anticipated cost savings: 2 FTE weekdays
Recommendation postponed for further study and coordination

October 20, 2025 Zoom transcript
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But thanks for your, uh, your patience, and… I'm Gabriel Martinez, I am
one of the Community Engagement Specialists here at RTD.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And as I do… as we begin, I will share my screen so everyone can see.
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is a presentation that we have. This presentation will be available.
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
on our website, a little later today. Although I'm told there are some
Amazon Web Service outages globally that may affect.
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That may affect our… ability to access some of the links.
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that are currently within our… a presentation that we'll be going over
today.
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I also have, uh, we also have here with us, uh, Dan Merritt, who is one

And Gabriel, sorry to interrupt you, but you're in the notes mode?
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Yes. Okay.
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I don't know why that is, that should not be here.
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:25.000
For the presentation?
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Is it still in notes mode?
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It is.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Today, we are going to discuss the proposed service changes for January
2026.

1.D.1.k

All right, I guess I could use a little help getting out of this. I've
never had this problem before.
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Hey Gabriel, um, if you want a quick solution, um, do you want me… I can
share my screen, um, just in presenter mode.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Um, so that you can, as you're going through it, you can still look at
your notes, if you think that would be helpful.
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Yes. Why don't we do that? Thank you, Taylor.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Okay. Yeah, no problem.
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Okay.
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Here we go. Slideshow…
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Oh my goodness.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:50.000
All right, let's see if this is working… And… let me… Select my screen to
share now. Very fun. Uh…
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
There we go, and I will… doo-do-do…
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
All right, everybody, does this look right?
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
All right, everybody, this… does this look right?
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Yep.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That does look right. Thank you, Taylor. So, let's go into the next page.
We'll start with a safety update.
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Um, before we get into the proposed changes. Uh, one of the first things
that everyone should know is that.
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Um, so that you can, as you're going through.

1.D.1.k

Our latest metrics for. security-related calls for service.
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.000
are available for July, and. That ratio is one call for every 1,814
boardings.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
In other big news… big news, we have… Um, a new detective, excuse me,
Taylor, can you go back?
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Thank you. A detective bureau that just started on… October 15th?
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And they now have the ability to. investigate and prosecute crimes.
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So we have a fully functioning detective bureau as well.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Next slide, please. the planned… Uh, we have a small update for the
Downtown Rail reconstruction project.
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Second phase, as many of you know, of the planned rail reconstruction.
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
project to Calmass Street, affect the start of this fall.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Uh, the work's taking place between Aurrea, Colfax, and the theater
District.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
station, and those have significantly impacted the Lane, which has been
suspended.
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And it's altered the D and H lines, which have been.
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
rerouted to Union Station and truncated at Southmore Stations,
respectively.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Next slide, please. So, we'll have an… We'll take a moment to give an
overview of service changes, we'll talk about what they are, what the
proposed changes.

are currently, and how to provide feedback and input to these proposed
changes.
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Because of the relatively few amount of changes compared to some of the
past ones that we've done this year.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
session this time around. However, we will be providing.
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
sometime towards the end of this presentation for. the public to provide,
um, some feedback, some.
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
comments, and especially to ask some questions. Since we have some of the
service planners here today as well.
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Then, we'll end the presentation with a timeline and next steps.
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So, what are service changes?
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So, as many of you may know, and some of you, if you are new here.
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
The service changes are… process in which RTD reviews, proposes, and
implements changes to its service.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
schedules three times per year. Usually these take place in January.
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
May or June. and August or September.
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000
As well. So, service changes… for multiple objectives, such as increasing
reliability of RTD services, improving.
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:18.000
on-time performance, enabling representative employees to select work.
And also accounting for changes in ridership.
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Next slide, please.
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So there are five categories of… service changes. Uh, the first one is,
um… Well, we have route adjustments, we have service increases.

Packet Pg. 23

Attachment: Attachment K Public Comment (5233 : January 2026 Service Change)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
We will not be having an Ask a Service Planner.

1.D.1.k

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Service reductions, seasonal adjustments, and schedule timings. And the
definitions are all here.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So now, with this in mind, we'll go on to the proposed changes for
January 2026.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And we will begin with the changes affecting our rail system.
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Thank you, Gabriel.
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
All right, so, yes.
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
My name is Dan Merritt, I'm a Senior Service Planner as Gabriel announced
earlier.
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And I'll just talk through our changes that we have scheduled for this
time.
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
or that we're proposing for this time.
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
For light rail, we're proposing some changes to the D and E line.
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
For the D line, pending completion of the downtown rail reconstruction
project,
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
We are recommending to restore the D-line service to central downtown,
and to make some minor changes to the schedule.
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Um, last slide, please, still. Not ready to move on yet.
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Can we go back a couple slides? Thank you.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Sorry about that. It's auto-advancing, and I'm trying to figure out how
to fix it.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000

Uh, please feel free to… Um, review this later if you have questions.

1.D.1.k

Okay, thank you.
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Back one more if we can, please.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We'd also like to just make some minor changes to the E-Line.
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
That will accommodate the changes to the D&H line schedules to get
everything moving together smoothly on the tracks.
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Okay, next slide, please.
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
For the H and L line, we are also going to do some minor proposed changes
that will accommodate larger travel times.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
For the H line…
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And allow full service to be restored for the L-line.
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
When we complete the downtown rail reconstruction project.
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Next slide.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And finally, for rail, the R and the W lines.
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We would also just like to make a few…
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
changes to those, um, to accommodate changes to the E-Line and the H-line
schedules.
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
When we complete the downtown rail reconstruction project.
00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Thank you.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Yes, next slide. There we go.

1.D.1.k

Also, in conjunction with the reroute from Kauffman and 8th,
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
removing the detour to Brosnath.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
The bolt will extend operations back to Kaufman.
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
between 9th and 3rd Avenue to serve the 8th and Kauffman Park and Ride,
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Instead of the detour de Brostnath as well.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And the FF5 will make some minor schedules to the schedules.
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Improving on-time performance and service reliability there as well.
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
free metro ride, we'll make some minor changes to the schedule to improve
on-time performance and reliability there.
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
The LDs 1 and 3 will extend operations back to Kauffman.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
between 9th and 3rd for the Kauffman and Park and Ride.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Um, instead of going to Brosnan 8th.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And the LX2 will also do the same.
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And those are all of our proposed changes for January.
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000
We'd love any feedback or input that you have to share at this time.
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Hi, my name is Alexis Monahan, and I got this meme meal noted, um,

The AB2 will make some minor weekday schedules to improve on-time
performance and reliability.

1.D.1.k

And I thought there was going to be some changes as far as the…
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.000
um, payment in January?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Um, it doesn't sound like we have Aaron here, or anyone from any of those
services available.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
We can take your contact information, Alexis, and get back to you as soon
as possible on that. If you want to drop your name in the chat.
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
That would be great.
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
A phone number and email address, and we'll get somebody back in touch
with you as soon as we can.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Thank you, appreciate it.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Sure thing. Thank you for your patience on that.
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Uh, yeah, this is Steve Lotterman, uh, the notice mentioned that the
Platte Valley FlexRide service would be discontinued.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Are you able to address that today?
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Um, I work on busside, so FlexRide isn't one of my specialties. I do
believe that I had heard
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
that that was going to be happening.
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Um, but I cannot confirm that at this time.
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Does… is anybody else on this call who's here happen to know anything
more on this?
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Okay, alright.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:01.000
That is not a topic that I am prepared to speak upon. Do we have anyone
today from either of those services today?

1.D.1.k

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Yes, we can, Jesse.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Uh, for the, you know, as a recommendation to the board of directors. It
should be known that the, uh, the FlexRide is not performing extremely
well.
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000
It hasn't been for quite some time. our cost per boarding has crested at
over $1,000 per boarding.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Which is a number we have not seen yet.
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
on any of our services, to tell the truth. So, that's the reason why the
service was put up.
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Uh, as a recommendation for. a reduction or a elimination.
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Also, at the same time, the Denver Connector Service overlaps a good
portion of the FlexRide.
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
So, we would ask that you also consider and look at the Denver Connector
service area.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And, uh, we can provide you with information regarding that as well.
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Uh, yeah, thanks, Jesse. So, and I don't want to take too much time, but
for me in particular, the Denver Connector Service does not.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:10.000
does not service my place of employment. Um, and I would also like to
note that anecdotally, talking to the drivers, ridership on the Platte
Valley FlexRide has been increasing. I don't know if your numbers reflect
that or not.
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Um, but I'd just like to… I'd like you to consider keeping the service,
if at all possible. So, thanks for your time.
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Okay, thank you for your input.

Manager for Service Development, and yes, that is in the proposal at this
point in time.

1.D.1.k

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Um, we're just gonna offer the public, um, some opportunities to provide
feedback. Um, as you can see here on the screen, um, there are a number
of ways to provide feedback regarding these service changes. Um, if we
happen to not get to everyone today.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Um, so there is an online survey, um. That, um, you can access. Um, you
also, um, you're also able to call our customer care department and share
feedback with a call center agent.
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Um, you know, this option, uh, this is what you're doing today, attending
a virtual, yeah, virtual meeting.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Um, visiting with us at a community event, or sharing, um, sharing your

more, kind of, guidelines for our public.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Um, it's a more, kind of, vibrance for our public.

feedback portion today.

think it's best just to go to Nicodemo. It looks like you have your hand
up.
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Oh, perfect, okay.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Yeah, hello. I saw you change the schedule for the 206. There's a lot of
problems with the skip also at that high school. It's just really poorly
scheduled.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:57.000
The trippers are, um, not around the time the students actually let out,
and so they're hardly picking anyone up. Do you have any input on that?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Um, alright, well, um, Gabriel, I don't know if you want to step in at
this point, but, um, as we move forward, um, through the next little bit
of our meeting together.

1.D.1.k

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Yes, hi. I don't know if you can quite see me on the screen. I'm actually
Hantos, I'm the lead for North Team.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Um, you can continue to take a look at it and see.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000
If we can shift some trip times, however, with the frequency already
being at 10 minutes, it's gonna be.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
hard not to have two buses on top of each other.
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
We'll continue to monitor it and see if we can make some further
adjustments with the next run board.
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Okay, thank you. Yeah, because we keep getting called to incidents over
there, because students are… Um, you know, more or less, like, kind of
fighting to get on these buses, because… just the way the trippers… the
trippers aren't…
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000
preemptively picking up students, so the ones that do arrive, there's
just been problems with that, so I thought I would just ask about that.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And there was another complaint that, um, we've been getting from drivers
on the dash, so I guess when they scheduled.
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
whenever they made the extension from Lafayette to Canterbury and
Willoughby.
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
they didn't add any additional time, so I've been getting a lot of
complaints from drivers about.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:15.000
that, and why they're not increasing the, um, the time, because they have
hardly any recovery time. So that was… that was something else I wanted
to ask about.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Yes, thanks for asking in that regard, and we did, uh, look at that
schedule, and yes, there is not enough time. We were… We did go ahead and

Packet Pg. 32

Attachment: Attachment K Public Comment (5233 : January 2026 Service Change)

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Um, yes, the 206, we made the adjustment because we were able to do so.
The skip is a much higher frequency, and it actually already has an extra
tripper scheduled for the school.

1.D.1.k

looked at what it would take to make those adjustments to provide the
additional running times, and it would result in at least an additional
10 hours.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Um, so at this point, we will not be able to make that change. However,
we have that in our sandbox, and as soon as we can make that adjustment,
when resources become available, that will be a priority.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Sorry, what's the additional 10 hours?
00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:01.000
It will result in an additional 10 hours of service, in-service hours, by
adding the additional time needed between Lafayette Park and Ride and
Willoughby.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Oh, okay.
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:14.000
We will have to completely re-block the route. And it will have to be reblocked with also the 225 and the jump in order to keep it as efficient
as possible, and to require the least amount of resources overall.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
But the least amount of resources will still result in at least 10
additional hours.
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Okay, no, that's great. I just keep getting asked about it, and there's a
lot of frustration, so… but that makes sense, thank you.
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Sure. Nicodemo, may I ask you a question? Uh, which organization do you
represent? Are you with Boulder?
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
No, yeah, sure.
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
County, or… with RTD street supervision.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And currently, we do not have that for the January service change. We do
have no additional resources available.

1.D.1.k

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Okay, good. No, no, that's fantastic. Well, um, I will reach out to you,
uh, after this meeting.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Thank you.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
So, we now have, uh, two… looks like we have two questions in the chat.
The first one is from Anonymous.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Uh, can you please move the jump back to Gate A at the downtown.
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000
older, uh, bus terminal.
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:33.000
We can look into that, um, as an additional stop on the route. However,
if we do that, it will take additional running time, at least 5 minutes,
well, 3 to 5 minutes, depending on time of day.
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
And that will result in additional resources needed as well.
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Um, we will take a look at that as we look at the overall restructuring,
then, for the DASH.
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:57.000
the jump, the 225, um, inner lines. And, uh, if we can make it work,
we'll add it, and it will adjust the routing instead of being able to
come off of 14th Street northbound directly onto Canyon, and then.
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Head back southbound on 14th and back onto Arapaho.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Uh, to get on its, uh, full routing, it would then have to come,
obviously, across Canyon, um, 14th to Walnut, Walnut to 15th, and come
around the block, and that's where the additional running time is, and.
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:28.000
hitting the additional signals, so we will have to take a close look and
see if it's doable or not, but we have that noted. Thank you.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Is that anonymous question? And, uh, Alexis, there's some… extra
information that Brandy Hunter has put in the chat.

Service-related calls, so security-related calls for service, for
customer.
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
uh, were… Uh, one call for every 1,814 boardings.
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And the latest security-related metrics can be seen at RTDenver.com.
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Uh, slash security-related metrics. Another new development is that on
October 15th, so very recently.

detective bureau.
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And we now have 4 K-9 units as well.
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Next slide.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I'll give a brief update on the Downtown Rail Reconstruction project now.
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So, uh… This second pl-, as many of you may know, the second phase of the

Rerouted into Union Station. truncated at Southmore Stations,
respectively.
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Next slide. So as we continue, I'll give a… brief overview of service
changes, the differences between service changes and.
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
those changes, and… We'll also have time for feedback and input today.
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And timeline… we'll also give a timeline for the next steps.
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I want to briefly say that in the past, we have often done.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
ask a service planner sessions. in which members of the community have
been welcome to.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
ask their questions. directly to service planners.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Given the relatively few number of changes that are.
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
being proposed for January 2026. We will not have.
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Ask a service planner this time, in the month of October. However, we
will have some time at the end of the presentation.
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000
for you to ask your questions. And I'm sure many of the… Voices here may
have some questions.
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Uh, so please hold on to those until the… question and answer session.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.000

Um, a little bit later in this presentation. All right, next slide.
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So… little description of service changes.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
RTD reviews, proposes, and implements changes to its service changes… to
a service.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Effected January, May. or June and August or September.
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And each service change, uh, can support multiple objectives.
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the most common objectives are to increase reliability. Improve the ontime performance, account for changes in.
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000
ridership, uh, advance… Um, well, support… scheduled maintenance
projects, and also to.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
enable our represented employees. to select work shifts.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So those are several of the reasons why we do our service changes.
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Next slide.
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We have 5 categories of service changes. Um, descriptions are all here,
but I'll name them briefly.
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
We have route adjustments. service increases, service reductions.
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Seasonal adjustments. schedule timing, and as a.
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Spoiler, most of our… proposed changes for January 2026 are.
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
either a service increases. scheduled timings or, uh, maybe small.

1.D.1.k

I'm not sure if we have any big… route adjustments outside of rail.
Actually, there are a few, so we'll get to those in… due time. Next

So at this point, I'll hand it over to.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:59.000
All right, thanks, Gabriel. So, we'll start out with rail, um, coming up
for rail changes on the D line.
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Uh, pending construction… pending completion of the downtown rail
reconstruction project, uh, the D line will return to its normal routing
through the downtown loop.
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Um, the E line will be… have some schedule updates to accommodate changes
to the D and H line schedules.
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Go to the next slide. The H line, um, also pending completion of the
downtown rail reconstruction project, will restore its service.
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Um, the R line also, uh, pending completion of the rail reconstruction
project, and the H line schedule update, uh, will make some minor changes
to the R line to better.
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:07.000
associate with the H line. And the W line will also have some minor
changes to accommodate changes in the Union Station area with the E line.
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and D line. On the bus side.
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:28.000

The Route 44 will shift weekday departure from Civic Center Station from
516 to 522, and that will resolve a current gate conflict.

Um, at Civic Center Station to… allow for… buses to fit into the gate
there.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000

Thank you, Sam. Uh, we can go to the next slide.
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
So, RTD provides a variety of ways to provide feedback.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Today, we are… Um, during our public meeting, but you can also provide
feedback through an online survey.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Uh, by calling Customer Care. 303-299-6000.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You can provide public comment at a virtual or in-person.

event, uh, which would include the board of directors meetings.
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And, uh, other community events, so if you see RTD staff at a local
community event.
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Such as, uh, Boone Union Station, which is coming up at Union Station.
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Um, on the 30th, you could provide. your comments or questions directly
to someone like myself.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And, of course, you can always send an email at any time to
service.change at rtddenver.com.
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Next slide. So, now we will have a few minutes. I think we're budgeted
for about.
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
10 to 15 minutes, uh, for… some public comment and some questions.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And just a few reminders as we get started.
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Uh, we're… everyone is asked to be respectful of one another.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:40.000

Um, but if you are… We run out of time to provide, uh, commentary or a

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000
answer any questions, and I do see… Uh, one in the, uh, in the question
and answer section right now.
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
from Helen Bushnell. Helen writes. RTD needs to do a better job of
letting people know.
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
about server changes. In particular, people don't know that the.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
100 runs more frequently than it used to. I'm sure that's the case for
other routes as well.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Well, Helen, thank you for your comments, and thank you for your
question.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Um, I'll direct… everyone, uh, to one of the things we said earlier,
which is that our service changes.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
happen typically three times per year. Um, usually at the beginning of
January.
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I mean, towards the end of May or beginning of June.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Um, and we actually don't have one hour scheduled for this meeting, so
that's a mistype on my part.

1.D.1.k

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And again, at the end of August, or… Uh, at the beginning of September.
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So, uh, those… those are the times that RTD has committed to.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
It looked like Brandy was saying that she wanted to answer?
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Let's see… go ahead, Cooper.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
what it showed in the Q&A box.
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I think… I think she was just marking that so we knew to answer it live
in front of… in front of everybody.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And I think I did see a hand…
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
This is… this is Natalie with NorthTeam. I will just add that
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
We do outreach.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Go ahead, Natalie.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Um, the information goes out on the website, it goes out in news
releases,
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
the social media, so we do have outreach if, um, Helen perhaps has some
suggestions as to
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Or we could do additional outreach, we will take those suggestions into
consideration.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Yes, please. And I think one of the best ways to find out about service.
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Changes can be to follow RTD on social media.

Providing, uh, changes. Um, do any… Any service planners want to weigh in
on this?

1.D.1.k

And, um, also, maybe to mark something on your calendar.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Um, when a public meeting. Um, because I know not everyone wants to
attend a social… to follow us on social media. Just keep in mind those
times that we have.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And then we will follow that one with Martine afterwards.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Okay, so my name's Donnie, and I'm Victoria's husband, and I have a
comment about.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Victoria?

Getting rid of the service of the 35 on the Hamden Furnage Road.
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Okay.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And I totally agree that it was very hard to find out about these
meetings, and that that was even.
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:14.000
being discontinued, but now… like, I just need you guys to maybe… Think
about bringing a bus back, because I lived here since 2008, and there's
been the 26th, the 27, and the 35.
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And it's extremely inconvenient for somebody that doesn't drive.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
to have to walk 20 minutes to get to the reroute of the 35.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And I just think maybe it doesn't go all the way.
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
But if it could go from Inglewood Station to… the hand and bargain ride,
or Southwest Plaza?
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000
That would be… very convenient, and there's a lot of condos and townhomes
over here.

Victoria's hand first.

1.D.1.k

And I think that it's affecting a lot of people negatively, and I just
think that's something you could.
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
consider for the future. as a permanent route in that location again?
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Okay. Thank you. Um, would one of our service vendors from the West team.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Yeah, it's just me today. Yeah. Uh, so my name is Matthew Biskey, I'm
service planner scheduler on the West team.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And the reason we made the change on the 30 and 35.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:22.000
was because we were following with the SOP that we have, that the board
of directors for TD has basically said these are kind of the benchmarks
you want to.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
start working towards in the next 5 years, while we're getting about to
that 5-year plan.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And the idea was that we wanted to improve service on federal, because
everything was kind of chopped in half.
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And unfortunately, the Hamden Frontage Road kinda lost out to that.
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
So, we are aware of these concerns, we are aware that we did have to move
the 35 to cover Bear Valley out to Wadsworth Hampton Park and Ride.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:57.000
We apologize for the inconvenience, and… Please know that we hear you on
this issue, and we're gonna definitely take this into consideration
about.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Uh, further route… deviations.
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
All right, thank you, Matthew. Martin, it looks like you are next.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Hi, thank you. First of all, thank you guys for holding this, um, this
presentation. Um, so I… live in Highlands Ranch, and I work in Littleton.
Um, I work at the Center for the Blind down in Littleton, and recently

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Please respond to this.

1.D.1.k

the schedule changed to the 36 route, uh, has affected, uh, our workplace
and our training center for our over 30 blind students who attend
training there on a.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Um, I'd be interested to hear on why that change was made. Um, I've heard
nothing, uh, no information regarding that. Um, so that is my primary.
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:17.000
concern, and uh, secondarily to that would be, um, who or what is the
process for, for, um.
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
making some suggestions. I'm thinking the Route 24 at the south end.
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:43.000
It stops at the C470 park and ride. And I don't think it'd be too much of
a stretch to have it continue traveling south on University to make a
connection with the 402L. And the 402L, of course, as many of you may
know, is the primary bus, and I think the only bus that runs in Highlands
Ranch, so making that connection.
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
would be fantastic. Thank you.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Okay, thank you for some very thorough, uh, thoughts and insights.
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Okay, uh, for the first part, I think Matthew can… answer that one. And
regarding the 24.
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
That would be the East team, so let's have Matthew.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
answer the first part of that, and someone from the East team, do we have
a… okay.
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Uh, Kelsey, Ryan, Will. discuss, uh, 24.
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Yeah, so the 36, um, again, with everything that was going on with the
federal changeover, with.
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000

Packet Pg. 49

Attachment: Attachment K Public Comment (5233 : January 2026 Service Change)

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:57.000
weekday basis. Um, we had to push back our start time from 8 o'clock to
8.30, um, because our students aren't able to make it into the center on
time. Um, and so I am hoping that, um, I can… put this in somebody's ear,
um, to push that 36 schedule back to what it was previously.

1.D.1.k

Removing the Route 29, wrapping it into the Route 30 to cover South
Federal.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:44.000
So, the 36 just kind of got… pushed around a little bit, time-wise,
because we were just trying to have a nice little gap between the 36 and
the 30 showing up at Littleton Station, so we didn't have any conflicts
there.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
But we can definitely take a look at, uh, at the timing. Is there a
particular stop.
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
that you're looking for that I can, uh, I can write down in my notes so I
can bring up to the rest of my team tomorrow morning?
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Yeah, the specific one is 5700 block South Low Boulevard, so I think
currently it's scheduled to… arrive slash depart there at 48 after the
hour.
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Okay.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Um, where previously it was 28 after the hour, so that would be great.
And as far as the gate conflicts, um, currently the 36 departs from Gate
D, and the 30 departs from Gate B as in Bravo, so that shouldn't be… Um,
from my perspective, a reason for that schedule shift.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Yes, we understand the issue, but again, since this is the first run
board we've been working on this, we were just trying to make sure that
everything was right. Unfortunately.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Sounds like one of these things got caught in the wash. We will
definitely take a look at it tomorrow morning.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Thank you.
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Okay, thank you, Martin, and Kelsey, could you weigh in on the 24th?
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Yeah, hi Martin. My name's Kelsey Ryan, I'm the acting lead service
planner scheduler for RTD's East team.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
The 36 did get affected, because we were trying to avoid gate conflicts
at Littleton Downtown Station.

1.D.1.k

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Uh, great idea on that, uh, 24 extension. Matthew mentioned earlier the
SOP, or System Optimization Plan.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:20.000
down further into Highlands Ranch, ultimately out to Lincoln Station, but
on its way to Lincoln Station, it would make a connection with the 402L.
It would have several overlapping stops.
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
So that is something that's on our radar, that is a change we would like
to make.
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Oh, awesome. Happy to hear that. Thank you guys very much.
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Uh, in the near future.
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
You're welcome. Now, I don't see any other hands at the moment.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Uh, but let's… As… let's see, are there any other questions?
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Right. Going once… Going twice… Yes.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Uh, Gabriel, I did want to bring up, uh, from our team real quick.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Uh, the reason why we were having issues with the 36 and why we changed
the times was when we used to have the 29 and the 36 blocked together.
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:14.000
So those schedules were extremely interlined. And when we took the 29
out, we had to completely redo the 36.
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And unfortunately, that forced us to end up shifting the time
significantly.
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:28.000
So, we can definitely look into trying to get that fixed up for the next
run board.
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Yes, please, Anne.

It is about the RTD Flex. route that's in Platte Valley.

Thank you. Yeah, is there… before I go on explaining, um, is there a
specific question or comment that you had?
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Regarding the Flat Valley.
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Well… I'm the driver of the morning… route for the… for the, um… the
Platte Valley, and I heard that they were going to discontinue it.
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Which, you know, was just kind of disemp… you know, was just kind of…
disappointing, because it's starting to pick up.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
So, um, I didn't know if they were… I mean, if they are going to
discontinue it.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Or if they can, like… hang in there and give it a chance.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Because it is starting to pick up.

Um, and the point that you make about it picking up is, yeah, it's pretty
interesting.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Okay.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Um, the ridership on it is… is terrible. I'm looking at the ridership
right now. From the beginning of the year, January 1st.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:27.000
There have been 900 passengers. Um, and that is… it is painfully low. It
is a very expensive route to operate.
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:35.000
There are not very many people who live within that service area who are
utilizing it to go places within that service area.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:44.000
as it currently is designed, um… So, while I… I do take your comment very
well.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:58.000
that, yeah, things are changing, and we did, over the last couple of run
boards, try to make some changes that would give it a… a breath of life.
It's still not performing anywhere near, uh, where it needs to be, so…
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Um, whether or not it is discontinued is beyond… that is above me, that
is up to the board, and… And the decision makers, but… Um, uh, your
comment is… I hear what you're saying. It's real, I see it in the data as
well on a monthly basis, but…
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Right. Yeah, because I haven't been… I haven't even been on the route not
even a year.
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
And… and it was slow in the beginning. I mean, I was lucky if I had a
couple people a day.
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Um, so, I mean, I know it was bad.
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:49.000
And I know that it has picked up. Um, but I, um… And Cassie, and there is
a… there's a lot of people that do ride that… they heard about it from,
like, a friend.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:07.000
It has been picking up a little bit. Um, the problem with the Platte
Valley FlexRide is that it has spent many, many, many, many years of not
picking up.

1.D.1.k

00:27:49.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Or, I mean, not everybody knows about… the Platte Valley… At all. It's
like, um… I know that it's been out there, but I mean, a lot of people
have… They've made comments, why just, you know, heard about Platte
Valley, and we didn't even know what it was.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
So, you know… It's kind of hard when people don't know.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Yeah, I think that's definitely a fair comment as well. That's, um… you
know, people are very familiar, for the most part, with RTD fixed route,
and our rail lines and things like that, but unless you live within.
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:42.000
a community… within the district that either FlexRide is its predominant
public transportation option, or, um, it's very popular there and very
heavily utilized.
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Yeah, something like the Platte Valley Flex Ride, that's true. It was not
necessarily super well known, and that was… Also, something that we were
starting to work on with the City and County of Denver, and because they
have a microtransit, um.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:05.000
pilot that they're rolling out down, not quite in the same area, but down
there to the southwest a little bit, in the Sun Valley.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
So, um, yeah, I agree. It's a bit of a shame that it is starting to pick
up, and.
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Of those, um, 900 writers from the beginning of the year that I
mentioned.
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
almost 300 of those came last month, which, when I pulled the data, I
was, like, I truly can't believe it.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Um, so, yeah, point very well taken. Um, all of this data will be shared
with, um.
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:44.000
with Jesse, and with the board, and all the other senior decision makers,
and things like that, but… Um, it has been… drastically underperforming.
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Right.

when they don't know about it.

1.D.1.k

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:57.000
for many, many years, and um… If it was to stick around for… some reason,
it would need some major surgery, even still. We would need to add more
destinations in more neighborhoods, because as it's currently designed, I
still don't think it's sustainable.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
And then they have to, like, stop, and they gotta go to the Alameda
station.
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
So, you know, so they can go, you know, so they can go, you know, catch
another bus.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
when I could just take them. And, um, so I kind of wish that the area was
a little bigger.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Um, because, you know… I'm losing some people that way. And then I have
regulars.

that are just, uh… you know, that have been writing and… And now they're,
you know, they're worried.

This data will be shared with. with Jesse, and also with the board of
directors.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Um, so thank you for that. And we do have a few other questions, and I'll
make sure everyone has time to answer.

Well, see, and that's… that's where I have, um, I have people asking me,
well, why don't they make it a little bigger? Because there's some areas
that I can't go to.

1.D.1.k

Okay, and I just, um, uh, this is piggyback off of the… the… Um, the
FlexRide, um… For comparison, um, how many people take the FlexRide, the
Louisville.
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Is that the same as the call-in ride?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Um, you may be referring… I do want to clarify, FlexRide is different
from Accessoride, um… I… Okay, yeah, historically used to be known as
Colin Wright, but areas up there, up north, also have their own.
00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:01.000
like Broomfield has their own… sort of, like, dial a ride. There's all
sorts of names and services up around there, so I just want to be clear.
Flexride.
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
currently is only known as FlexRide.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Okay, um, and so there's a… so in a month, how many people take the
Louisville Flex Ride?
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Um, offhand, I couldn't tell you, but it is a lot more than Platte
Valley.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
like, 10 times more, twice as much, like, what… approximately? What is a
lot more?
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Um, again, I can't… I… I don't want to… put out any conjecture without
having data in front of me, but… Um, Louisville gets many hundreds of
riders a month.
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
And Platte Valley, typically before this last month. was lucky to get
more than 100.
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Okay.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Okay. Okay.
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:53.000
So, Helen, if you… would like, you can put your, uh, your… Contact
information in the question and answer section.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
No, no, no, no, no, not Accessoride. So, there's a, there's a…

1.D.1.k

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:01.000
And I can share that with Sage. And we can perhaps give a… more
information.
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Okay. Okay.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Victoria, or maybe it's from Donnie, I guess, I'm not sure. We're both in
the same section.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Um, the… the question is, what's the likelihood that the 35 will be.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
returning in the new year. Or, that's even a bus.
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:32.000
to cover between Union Station. or Southwest Plaza.
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Yeah, so what is the likelihood that. The 35 will be returning in the new
year.
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Or that's a new bus, we'll… exist to cover between Englewood Station to
Southwest Plaza.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
I think I'll end up having to take that one.
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000
So, the answer is not very likely, unfortunately. Again, with the system
optimization plan.
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
there's really not a major demand. At least according to the report
itself.
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:07.000
for a… for a service between those two points. It doesn't mean we can't
look into it, but at the moment, especially by the new year.
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I would say the chances are extremely low. Because, uh, again, the west
side, uh, is very complicated in some ways to get new services in there.

My employer has moved to 16th street to support downtown development but the D Line that I could right does
not have non-stop access to union station
I believe there needs to be a d line to union station. Now that the 0 bus is not non-stop and requires a transfer this
make it difficult for residents in the southwest suburb to get into downtown and access the other light rail trains
like the A line.
D line service to Performing Arts Center area and central business areas is important as it’s one of the few ways
to get there from the south suburbs.
Much more difficult getting from Littleton to the airport and back if the D doesn't serve union station
Great bus. No change needed. Thx anyway. Cheers!

We use the D line to get to Union Station and to connect to FF1 Flyer to Boulder and A line to airport far more
than we would to downtown. The added time to make two transfers instead of one makes these trips nearly half
again as long. I feel that we can afford to take a little more going downtown because 1) not on a tight schedule 2)
the total time of the trip is much less 3) Getting back late to Union Station from DIA or Boulder when the time
intervals for D & E trains are longer make wait times longer so security as well as the grueling trek home or to
destinations is stressful.
Or … Bring back the C line.
Thank you for the service you have provided us throughout the years.

Hi, like many others I travel directly from mineral Station to Union Station. Is there not some compromise we
could make by having superior connections to Union Station, or alternate every 15 minutes a D line or a C line? I
love it when you have the interruptions downtown because it means I can ride the train directly to Union Station, it
means I don’t have to wait in the cold at Broadway to change trains, and hope the E line is on time. It means I go
home and don’t have to wait for 10 minutes at the Broadway station for the D line to come.
Hopefully the D line timing will better connections with the bus lines that serve the stations
Consider alternating D Line to Union Station and Downtown every 15 mins. (Effectively bringing back the C Line
and run them each every 30mins…2 D lines every hour and 2 C lines every hour). The transfer at Broadway from
D to E line (or vice versa) is extremely inconsistent and often a long layover (more than 15 minutes).
Having the D line go to Union Station is perfect.
I have not used the D/H line since it stopped going to California. I was taking it to the arts complex. I will not use
RTD again until it once again runs that route. I refused to use it while it is rerouted to union station. It had been a
great inconvenience!!
Having the D line go to Union station is most ideal for me and has been great for the past month or so.
Please keep operating the D Line directly to and from Union Station. It makes more sense for commuters and the
transit system.
Please keep D line route to union station
You guys always make it hard for students to rely on the RTD. it’s not fair to all of the students that pay for a

I much rather prefer the D Line going directly to union station much like the old discontinued C line.

I’ve really loved being routed to Union Station as opposed to the traditional downtown loop! I don’t spend a lot of
time in downtown proper, so the fact that the D line now goes to so many central hubs (like Ball Arena, Union, etc)
has been incredibly convenient. Plus, it’s my understanding that people can take the Mall Ride from Union to get
to the downtown loop.

I respectfully request that light rail service on the [D Line] line be resumed immediately upon the completion of the
current construction, rather than waiting until the scheduled date of January 4th.
While riders appreciate the importance of maintenance work, a service interruption lasting through the holidays
and into the new year presents a significant hardship for many. The extended shutdown directly impacts rider
convenience, mobility, and the economic vitality of the community.
No comment.
I would like an earlier departure time from Downtown Littleton Station to the Broadway Station. The D misses the
E by 30 seconds and I have to wait 30 minutes for the E.
Very good to have some line that runs to the 16th street area, and not just all to union station
Would like to see a permanent train from mineral to union station.
I currently take the D line to Auraria West everyday so that I can get to school. Without the D line and the H line
(which also gets me to auraria campus), the E line will be packed with people
The current service going to Union Station offers a lot more options for transfers, without first transferring to the E
Line at Broadway.
18th and California is not convenient for many riders from Mineral who are going to sporting events. I have
noticed business/ work commute ridership is up since you detoured to Union stn. Please at least offer a schedule
with ability to transfer at Broadway with a short wait time if we have to take an E line from Union Stn. You do have
that in the morning. Why not evening? Mineral used to go to Union Stn. The switch to 18 and California was a bad
decision

18th and California is dangerous at night.
Hopefully, D Line service will be restored before the January service change. The rerouting to Union Station has
already gone on for too long, and the project is (was?) scheduled to be done in late November. It’s a lot harder to
make connections in and around downtown because of the added hurdle of having to get there from Union
Station. The system (especially downtown) is not as seamless or well-connected as it should be or as you claim it
is.

Having the downtown loop closed has been a HUGE hardship for me as a daily rider of the D Line. I work
downtown and commute from Littleton. With the downtown loop closed, I have had to purchase a scooter to get
me from the Auraria West Station to, basically, Civic Center Park. In that it's getting colder and with the possibility
of snow and ice on the roads, scootering to work will be hazardous and require me to drive downtown, find
parking and pay for parking. It is an inconvenience, to say the least, and so the opening of the downtown loop will
be a welcomed changed.

I ride from downtown Littleton Station to the Theater District. I’ll be happy when they restore service to downtown
even if it takes a little bit longer because currently I get off at Auraria West and walk almost a mile and it’s starting
to get colder out. If it was in the summer, I don’t mind getting off at Auraria West and walking.
To be sure I am voting correctly - my hope is that the D line will go back to its previous route (before August 2025)
which included direct service between Mineral station and 18th and Stout station.
Continue the D line to Union Station or bring back the C line. Otherwise, too inconvenient to take public
transportation.
The recent D line routing to Union Station has allowed me to ride light rail 5 days a week for the first time since
the C line was cancelled. Further, these Union Station D line trains are full morning and evening which is a
dramatic increase from when the D was routed to downtown instead of LoDo. Keep the Mineral Station to Union
Station routing. Please!
Ridership appears to be significantly up on the d-line since being rerouted to union station. Trains were close to
empty when going the downtown loop. If this change is made, then RTD needs to do a more effective job of
aligning the D and E lines because southwest Denver no longer has a direct route to union station.
I love when the D line goes to union station. It's extremely useful for me and I will be disappointed if the D line
goes back to 18th and California.
I like the D line going to union station, saves me a transfer
I would like the option of Union Station and 18th/Stout like we used to have. 18th and Stout is very far when you
work close to Union Station. Is it possible to have every other train to Union Station?
I live 2 blocks from the 18th and California station and work near Englewood. The D line returning to downtown
makes it so much easier to get to work. However I do think the C line from Union-mineral is still useful for times I
need to get from englewood to LoDo rather than have to transfer. Hopefully transfer times to the E line won’t be
too long.
95% of my trips go to or from union station, so this rerouting would add 3-25 minutes each way
The elimination of the C line to Union Station from Mineral has been extremely inconvenient. This ADDS
approximately 20 minutes to my commute in what used to only be a 30 minutes. The transfer at Broadway is not
synced so it is not convenient to simply switch trains. It is the same amount of time to ride to the downtown loop
and walk. Since routing to Union Station, the D line has been more full. It is disappointing that RTD canceled the
C line wholesale rather than alternate D and C lines like previously. Please bring back the C line.

Why is this not being reinstated to 18th and California after the proposed changes were scheduled to end at the
end of November?? You close the stations stating the estimate was 11/27 and now we have to do a service
change in order to get it back to normal? That doesn’t make sense to me. You detour to unction station, it should
just be routed back without question. Maybe I’m misunderstanding but it is affecting so many people with the
project and the closure.
I would prefer it going to union station like how the w line goes to Golden and federal center, especially since the
c line was discontinued a while back and it could help somewhat restore it

The route to Union Station has been much more convenient for me. Reverting to the old route isn't a deal breaker,
but I like the current one much more
I'm extremely disappointed that this schedule change appears to remove the Sunday and holiday service from
this line (it appears you've removed Sunday/holiday service from every light rail line).
The D line is the only way someone without a car can quickly get into Denver from Littleton and vice versa. This
more than doubles the commute into Denver on a Sunday from Littleton and that is inexcusable. I use the D line
every Sunday to get to work, and many people use this line to get back home after spending the night in Denver.
Cutting Sunday/holiday service for all of your light rail lines shows active hostility towards the people that ride your
trains. This shows you do not want to have a functional transit system and that you're trying to push people into
buying and using cars. This is a curfew on the poor that will lose people their jobs because they can no longer
work on Sunday. I know I will very likely lose mine because I will no longer be able to work on Sundays as this will
make my commute to my job more than 2.5 hours, one way. Cutting all your light rail services on Sunday/holidays
is truly awful and shows that RTD believes that the people who use their services are second class citizens who
don't deserve to go to church with their family or visit their family on holidays. You've shown that you think we
don't deserve a functional transit system by refusing to make your services 24 hours, and you're proving it again
by trying to remove a full day of service from all of the light rail lines.
Going directly to Union station is so much better for me. I didn’t use the light rail before the maintenance causing
the reroute but I love the straight shot to Union. I’ll probably go back to driving if direct access to Union from
Littleton is removed
I believe going to Union station is way faster
I have been unable to use light rail during the reroute to Union Station because it added significant time to my
commute. This proposed change means I would be able to use it again for regular commuting.
It has been such a struggle for my semester at school to not have access to Colfax at Auraria as a light rail
station. I've been late very many times because of the longer commute time on the train and the further walk from
both Auraria West and Ball Arena. I am very happy to see that they are trying to open Colfax at Auraria again.
I'm looking forward to the D line being restored. Going all the way to Union Station is inconvenient.
I am looking forward to the D line running downtown again rather than to the Union Station. I feel that the 18th
and California route serves those that work at both ends of downtown rather than just those close to Union
Station.

The D Line routing to Union Station has been a tremendous improvement. Previously, having to board at Evans,
transfer at Broadway, and then catch the E Line just to reach Union Station was quite inconvenient. The current
routing has made commuting much more efficient and accessible. Additionally, the existing D Line stops provide a
safe and convenient option for passengers traveling in from Littleton to attend Broncos and Nuggets games
(along with other downtown activities). Once the H Line service resumes, it will continue to offer ample options for
those traveling to the other station. Please keep the D line as-is!

I use the d line to go from Evens station to the Route 51 to go to Denver health .
More reliability is always good. However I do like the D line going to Union station right now because it better
serves me with a direct route to Ball arena and Empower for football and hockey season.
Bring back the C line!
I love when the D line goes to union station. I am closer to the Littleton station and work at DaVita.
It is very inconvenient when you reroute the D line to Union Station. In the evenings, it is so difficult to time a line
trip back to Aspen Grove that I have discontinued using the train until it is restored back to its original route.
D line trains should have 3 cars as opposed to 2, particularly during morning and evening rushes to accomodate
for additional traffic during the institutional year.
The D line not going to Union Station significantly extends my commute.
Greatly improves the ease of access for CU Denver students to access the many campus buildings located
downtown. Other campus commutes are actually improved as the Colfax @ auraria station stops dead center of
the auraria campus, area providing walkable and pedestrian friendly access. No more crossing 1-2 heavy traffic
intersections and 3 smaller ones just to get to class. 4 minute walk to the best library in Denver.
Simply put it is beautiful, elegant, and efficient. It doesn't get much better than that. Owen Wilson Wow.
The Auraria West Station is a valuable stop for people who need to access the Auraria campus
I'm excited for the D line to service downtown stations again instead of Union Station. The Union Station detour
has added an estimated 20-30min (each way) to my commute due to the new route. This has improved with Mall
Ride improvements, but it's still an added burden to the point where I've considered driving instead of using RTD
services.
Strongly recommend RTD keep the D Line termination at Union Station instead back to 18th & Cal. Union Station
is a better end point since it connects with all the Commuter Rail lines and is thus a much more useful connection.
RTD already dropped the C Line, which has significantly hurt the service to South West metro customers.
D line to Union Station is much more useful and seems busier than D line to central downtown. Is there any
chance of bringing back the route of the old C line? Maybe every other train along the santa fe corridor can go to
Union Station?

The D line returning to the loop makes perfect sense and seems to service more of the public transport market. I
strongly support the return to ‘normal’ as soon as is possible.
I want to take the D line into central downtown Denver, so this proposed "change" to go back to servicing
downtown Denver would be very positive, especially during the winter months.

I prefer the train coming into union station and taking free green bus to 19th and Blake.As a disabled passenger

That will improve connectivity to central downtown
Your service changes are always impacting to the schedules and routes into Downtown. Every year now for the
past 3 there are major changes to the routes and scheduling. For those of us who depend on the rail to get in and
out of Downtown this is terrible planning on your part. When things are supposedly running you also don't run
enough cars to accommodate the high volume of traffic downtown. This is not COVID times things have been
back in full swing for the last 4 years. Can't you all get it together?? Your services suck big time!! Instead of
messing up services during the day run big lights and do the work at night then run normal schedules during the
day.
Returning the D line to it's usual downtown service will save me a trip via the 16th Street Mall shuttle, which will
be so much better during the cold months.
Re-routing to Union Station adds 30 minutes each way on my way to work. This change makes my commute
much easier especially in those colder months.
I will always be in favor of keeping the route to California over a reroute to Union Station. So a change to the
schedule times is way more favorable than rerouting the line.
The time changes are immaterial to the D Line, once the current detour to Union Station is complete. That has
added nearly an hour to my daily commute to wait for shuttles to get me to and from Union Station.
so the d line will be destined 18 and california station.
The current route is far more useful to access sporting events, the convention center and transfer to the A line to
go to the airport. I feel the current route should be maintained or the C line should be brought back
Prefer union station terminal, better access to sports arenas, downtown events, and transfer to airport line. If D is
changed, please add C line back.
Would really appreciate getting access back to the Theater district asap. It's very convenient to get to that area
from the Littleton/Mineral station. Thanks for the hard work.

I'm curious when the D line would be "paused" again, and detour to Union Station. RTD shut down the rail line the
entire summer of 2024, then detoured it in 2025. It has become expensive to drive into Denver as I work in the
office, and I'm concerned that I will have to drive into Denver during the winter months if construction starts up

Please bring back an option for Union Station along the Santa Fe corridor. Transferring at Broadway adds
significant time. You can run the same number of trains and send held to central downtown and half to Union
Station. Give riders options. I have been riding this line for 20 years and would appreciate restoration of the
services originally offered.

I am a visitor to the Denver area who uses RTD to travel from Denver International Airport to Littleton. This
change basically makes it infeasible for me to use light rail because it removes the easy connection between the
A and D lines at Union Station. It's annoying to have to walk across downtown or take another bus to transfer
between these lines. As a result I will probably start using Uber or some other way to travel.
Great! Bring back the C line
I would oppose rerouting the d line away from union station, and instead recommend that downtown be served
only by downtown lines, with a new line connecting downtown to araira west.
I am looking forward to normal service being restored after the completion of the downtown rail reconstruction
project.
Since you once again have no genuine interest in bringing the C-Line back (as I would prefer) please make sure
the schedules are timed so that the wait for a Northbound E-Line at I-25 and Broadway is less than five minutes.
Honestly I would prefer to go to Union Station from Englewood Station, I do not like waiting at Louisiana-Pearl
Station because the traffic from I-25 there is very loud under the bridge, perhaps in the future you could consider
walling off the highway at that station so this is not an issue?
I commute directly from mineral station to the 18th and California station. My office is caddy-corner to that station.
The disruption of service and rerouting to Union station increases my overall commute time from 48 minutes to
over an hour, and sometimes 80 minutes depending on timing. Re-establishing service to California street will be

Not enough change to worry about
In my experience, the time the Northbound D line matches up awfully with the northbound E line. Often times the
train ends up stopping right before the station and you can watch as the E line rolls right infront of you.
I hope there is consideration for making a tight connection time for the D and the E line. So people traveling from
mineral Station in the southwest to the union station do not have to wait or hope that E line will be there to
connect with going north or south. Before the downtown interruptions, there was a 10 minute wait going
southbound to catch the D line. Please take into consideration those traveling from the southwest to Union

Need an express train on this line that doesn’t stop at all stations. Additionally, upgrade train cars to match G line
(for example)
The E Line runs late too frequently causing me to miss my transfer line.
PLEASE do not cut the northbound 5:10am E Line train. I won't be able to reliably get to work on time every day if
the earliest train is at 5:25am due to cancellations and delays. Shouldn't RTD be focused on improving service
rather than cutting service?
Train service being infrequent (every 30min) after 6pm is also frustrating. Especially when there are sports games
or events downtown. I do understand that staffing and budget issues make it difficult to run more frequent service.
Did I miss something in the instructions? I didn’t see what the changes are so it’s hard to evaluate their exact
impact. So I’m responding based on the words “minor changes”
I would have to take two trains instead of one everyday if this happens
It was not descriptive enough to say how the changes would affect me
The E line is vital for us students to get to the Auraria Campus. Any work on it during school months is detrimental
This schedule change seems to push the earliest available train going northbound on the E line later by about 15
minutes. This means that the earliest arrival at Union Station downtown is now 6:18. It negatively impacts me
because I ideally commute to arrive downtown around 6 AM, and this would make me late for my job. I have
taken this earliest train before and there are already quite a few passengers waiting for it. Pushing the earliest
train to be later will only cause the early train to be more crowded while delaying when passengers arrove
downtown. Meanwhile it seems that the D line consistently has the most prioritized schedule with earlier trains
running with the least amount of disruptions.
What changes?
I am seeing 404 only.
Please post the changes.
Increasing transit times will be a negative impact. Deleting one train every hour is not an impact.
I am really enjoying having each train be 4 cars. I hope that continues because the trips are much better.

Please keep live tracking up and online, this is very important when getting my ride, especially when it's getting

Please continue to provide accurate Live Tracking in the RTD website. This is the most reliable way to track when
a train is approaching, I never track when the train is "supposed" to arrive because it can be off from 2-10
minutes. I will also say that having 4 trains has been the perfect amount while the H-line is down. Can we keep 3
trains going for the E-line after construction in Central Downtown is done? And I understand there needs to be
changes to the E-line schedule with the D and H line moving on the track together again. In all, please keep live
tracking as accurate as possible. It's the only reason I wont use the train when it is down and especially when it is
cold.
The E line is one of most crucial and important lines on RTD. I would like to critique that the trains are delayed
once they reach Southmoor station due to the H line ending there. But the one major problem I have with E line
that needs to be fixed is transfers to the R line. Belleview is not an ideal station since there may be 15-30 minute
waits. Ironically, the Orchad station is a better transfer since trains come 5 minutes away once you are on the
platform.
Faster transfers are always nice. Transfer and wait times tend to be what makes taking transit take so long, so it's
always lovely to have those cut down on.

There is no E Line available for early morning. I catch E Line train at Arapahoe to go Union Station. I used to
catch E Line train at 5:09am before, now it changed to 5:24am. With this proposed change it is even further

Been using RTD for years. The E line for 3 years service has been not great. Changing the service schedule on

If the E line schedule is changed so more trains come to make up for any changes that may happen in D or H
line, that would be good. But, if the E line schedule has trains less often, that won’t be a good thing because
many people will be missing their trains

I cannot see the new proposed W line schedule to know if this is the case, but prior to the August service changes
the southbound E line departed Union Station only 3 minutes after the W line during the evenings. This would
often cause the E line to experience delays if the W line was not running perfectly on time. I can understand the
need for close spacing during peak hours but it seems silly to run these lines so close together when both are on
30 minute headways. It would be nice to see these services staggered more during off-peak hours. In addition, it
would be nice to see the 15 minute headways continue later into the night as they seem to on other lines,
although naturally this would require additional resources that may not be available.

Cutting Sunday/holiday service for all of your light rail lines shows active hostility towards the people that ride your

My bus (route 66) will not arrive in time to catch the 6:54am train which was what I normally took to work when it
was at 6:55am.
RTD continues to ignore the desire to use light rail by those who attend Avalanche games at Ball Arena by
scheduling stops at that station with no regard for game start and end times, resulting in having to arrive very
early or having to wait after games for up to half an hour to catch a southbound train. Trains from 6:00 - 7:30 and
from 9:30 to 10:30 should run every 15 minutes, not 30. You don't understand why ridership is dropping yet you
ignore the needs of your potential passenger base.
It depends on how much the schedule is changing. I don’t know if it’s being reduced to every 30 minutes or if it’s
just being shifted, but either way, I’d like further clarification
I think the e line is fine I just wish it didn't stop all the time in southmoor. It stops there and it delays the train
sometimes
As a daily E line commuter, seeing the proposed changes still run at 15 minutes intervals is important to me. With
such frequency, the changes do not impact my commute.
My wife and I use the E line in both directions to get to work and back.
There's not enough of these trains to accommodate the removal of H and D lines downtown. The carts are
packed, unreliable, and need to increase frequency to make these changes worth it.
I don't know what kind of impact "minimal schedule changes" will have on me. It is crucial that the E line runs at
least at 15 minute intervals. Otherwise, other updates to schedule should be fine.

that walk around the platform - stop looking at their phones. Yes, 90% of them do that.
I have to be at work on time and it’s getting tiring having to constantly switch my schedule to accommodate your
changes. Especially during bad weather and cold weather.

I can't tell from how you have this displayed, but it looks like there will be no E line service on Sundays. If this is
the case, then it presents a large problem for me. If Sunday is not displayed on the proposed changes because
the schedule remains the same, then this is unclear and should be specified somewhere. Thank you!
idk what to say

I am looking forward to normal service being restored after the completion of the downtown rail reconstruction
project.
The southbound route seems to be one minute sooner at the Lincoln station. Considering the real possibility that
the train will be slightly late by even 2 minutes, still makes my trip to leave by the 483 bus difficult. A few minutes
of allowing that bus to wait would make that trip easier, especially late at night. Otherwise, I will still have to
account for that and get back on the train at least 15 minutes sooner.

The Schedules have the D Line and H Line both going ahead of the E Line at the I25

I use the h line to the convention center but have been unable to have a direct ride for months.....it's been a long
time that I have had to utilize light rail from Florida to convention center as I work downtown
Please allow for early morning passengers to have time to get from 121 south to H north. As proposed, 121
reaches Nine Mile at 6:44 and train leaves at 6:44. Even just 5 minutes allows 121 riders to catch that train
without the longest possible wait, or catching the 30 minutes earlier 121.
I use this line weekly so it would be great to restore it to my usual commute. However I also use E Line if H is not
available so as long as that is available, I can at least have some way to get downtown by rail.

The Auraria at Colfax Station is vital for us students to get to the Auraria Campus. Any work on it during school
months is detrimental
This line needs to resume so that I can get to work. Currently, with the line ending at Southmoor I have to take an
hour long bus ride to access downtown Denver where my office building is. This line (Florida to 18th & California)
is vital for my daily commute. It is useless if it only runs from Florida to Southmoor.

The 5:18am train start schedule is too late to arrive downtown for customers who needs to be at work before
6:00am. A 5:00am start schedule is preferable especially with longer travel time to accommodate the project
activities. Thank you!
Giving us back our trains to the eastern part of the metro area is long overdue. Cutting down the H Line and then
replacing it with busses has been awful. Literally meant I've had to use other means of transport to get downtown.
Replacing trains with busses is, as a rule, functionally the same as ending service since the busses are so
unreliable that you can't use them to get anywhere in a timely manner. I really look forward to the H Line being
restored. I hope the "runs every 15 minutes" schedule actually happens.
Open the H line back up!!! It’s insane that my once 40 minute has increased to over and hour due to my train
being shut down. People are pissed. Trains are too packed. Open the fucking H line back up! And work on being
more timely. The ah line is always late. This is why people don’t take public transportation! It’s not as dependable
as it is marketed to be. Do better by your people or watch as your patrons fade away. Do better.
Theater district patrons and workers are and will be negatively affected.
HOW LONG SHOULD THIS UPDATING PROJECT LAST? THIS STARTED AUGUST 31.
The H line is the only line that goes from my neighborhood (Yale & I25) to the Convention Center. If the run times
can be more frequent, that would be a positive change.l
I respectfully request that light rail service on the H line be resumed immediately upon the completion of the
current construction, rather than waiting until the scheduled date of January 4th.
While riders appreciate the importance of maintenance work, a service interruption lasting through the holidays
and into the new year presents a significant hardship for many. The extended shutdown directly impacts rider
convenience, mobility, and the economic vitality of the community.
No comment.
Early morning proposed change will eliminate smooth connections to other busandand will lead to more than 30

The shutting down of half of the H line was a terrible decision and significantly negatively impacted me. My
commute has been increased from 45 minutes from the Convention Center station to the Florida station to almost
2 hours both ways. Please bring back the H line beyond Southmoor. Especially in January, where it will be
snowing and below freezing. Please.
Hell yes.
The H line has been my main way to get downtown for a long time and this service restoration would be a very
positive thing for me.
Put back the 5:09am train. Me and alot of us take that one there is at least 20 or more that hop on it at Iliff and
Nine mile.
I commute to work at least 5 days a week on average, I live near the 18th and California station, only a couple
blocks from home. Since the rail construction began, I’ve had to take the E line to work (Colorado station). With
winter approaching, it would be quite a journey on foot or scooter to union with snowy / cold conditions. Having
the H line return to the downtown loop, servicing the downtown area, I would be safer commuting to work as well
as countless of other people who live in the city but work in other regions.
My spouse works near the Colorado stn and this makes it a lot easier to commute to work. We live 2 blocks from
18th and California. Unfortunately without the H line service my spouse has had to drive to work often. And it’s a
bit difficult to travel to Union during early morning hours.
The language is very vague can you please elaborate and provide time frames.
If I am reading this correctly, following the finished construction of the downtown loop- the H line would continue to
go back downtown to 18th/california which would be awesome! I loved taking one train straight to downtown
versus taking a line north, having to get off and take the A line west. One thing I will say that I really enjoy seeing
is the security guards on the train asking for tickets. I feel that it helps keep those who abuse the public
transportations policies in line- although I have noticed that they will just 'get off' at the next station if they didn't
buy a ticket but it at least keeps those who act inappropriately in line. Thank you for implementing that service
Please add the 4:50am and 5:09am start service. There are customers that has to be in downtown Denver before
6;00am. Thank you!
H line is terrible. The nine mile station smells like utine and is full of bums. The train is also full of bums and pot
smokers. Please clean this up. It is an embarrassment!!! You need to check passes more frequently on this train
and enforce the rules for fairness to paying customers!

I would like to see the earlier time, because, for two reasons: 1. As a Zen Buddhist i need the earlier time to
server me time at the Denver Zen Center, originally could get to university before 5:45 AM. 2. because, at one
time, i need the trains earlier time to get to work from aurora, and could again for work, several times i saw just as
many if not more people at the earlier time, i'm not seeing at this time now you are starting service. Lastly, why
am i not seeing sunday service? is there not giong to be sunday service? i need sunday service, when moved to
Aurora, there was sunday service, and need it to get home either from the Zen Center or and if coming from

I'm extremely disappointed that this schedule change appears to remove the Sunday and holiday service from
this line (it appears you've removed Sunday/holiday service from every light rail line).

Having to switch trains to get to downtown has been very frustrating and time consuming. It would be nice to be
able to get there via 1 train
The return of these vital services should not be delayed until the next round of Service Changes -- services
should be restored at the earliest possible convenience after the downtown rail project is completed.
It's a more consistent schedule
My wife and I are thinking of moving out that way towards Aurora and finishing the project would help with work
transit.
H line needs to be restored as soon as possible. If the H line resumes what it did before the shut down in I believe
August, it would be fantastic.
It has been very disruptive not to have the H line running. I live downtown and work at DU, so I have had to get
myself to Union Station, adding considerable time to my commute. Service every fifteen minutes is great,
especially if that schedule extends to 7PM. I often work later and, at times, have run into problems where the
schedule shifts to every 30 minutes, which is not frequent enough. I wish it could be more frequent, like the
Chicago El!
Trying to catch the OL at I@% and Broadway is difficult as it is due to timing.
Boarding at Nine Mile and having to transfer at Southmoor is inconvenient, especially during peak hours.
Additionally, my commute to central downtown has become significantly more complicated. After reaching Union
Station, I’m required to switch to a third mode of public transportation just to get to my workplace in the central
downtown area.
Previously, the H Line route from Florida to 18th & California was much more efficient and direct. Restoring this
route would greatly improve the commuting experience for riders like myself who rely on a streamlined connection
to downtown.
Thank you for considering this feedback.
Having to take e line to get to work downtown has been quite a dramatic shift for me. Restoring service to H line
would make my life so much easier. Thank you

Cutting Sunday/holiday service for all of your light rail lines shows active hostility towards the people that ride your

Your service changes are always impacting to the schedules and routes into Downtown. Every year now for the
past 3 there are major changes to the routes and scheduling. For those of us who depend on the rail to get in and
out of Downtown this is terrible planning on your part. When things are supposedly running you also don't run
enough cars to accommodate the high volume of traffic downtown. This is not COVID times things have been
back in full swing for the last 4 years. Can't you all get it together?? Your services suck big time!! Instead of
messing up services during the day run big lights and do the work at night then run normal schedules during the
day.

I am looking forward to normal service being restored after the completion of the downtown rail reconstruction

I use the W line to get to and from work, as well as other errands. The missing ride at 6:07am from Union to
Golden on the weekends has really messed up my schedule and resulted in me having to find alternative, often
less safe, routes to get to and from work and often results in me being late and/or missing my connecting bus.
Other than that, as long as it leaves Oak station at 6:53pm, like usual, I am okay.
The w lines runs late too often and I miss my connecting train.
It really depends on the exact specifics of the changes. As long as they still run every 15 minutes it will not affect
me too much either way.

The scheduled time that the train arrives on weekdays at Auraria West station is perfect for giving me time to get
to class but not be there super early. If the time is pushed back, I may have to take an earlier train and then wait
around for a while for class to start.
please increase frequency of W line to 15 minutes until 11 or include an officer lots of bums grouping up and
harassing women and people in general just needing to get home from work
The change is not described in the previous page. As a result I am unsure how this would impact me.

It's hard to have time changes when you rely on the train. Any less often service will lead to people not using it
what are the proposed time changes? i have residents who are seniors and count on daylight hours.
The E & W lines used to be so easy but now I can't make the connections. It used to take me an hour now it
about 2 hours to get to work.
I do not have the slightest clue as you are only saying it wil changed to accommodate other changes with no
information regarding exactly what those changes are , just that they are accommodating another change . As
such I have to go with very negative. This remninds me of the trains being +/- on their arrival times at best.
Always try to use the light rail if possible but if the W line has less frequent service I might need to pay to take
rideshare from Golden to DIA
It is difficult to say the impact without fully understanding the schedule change but the change makes it difficult to
make timely connections.

It didn't say anywhere that I could find what are the proposed schedule changes, just that the schedule would be
changing. I am assuming this means a reduction in service? If so this qould make it harder to rely on the W line
for commuting to/from work.
The change is not defined , so how would I know the impact?

The change isn't specific enough to really know how it will impact me. If trains still run every 15 minutes (during
weekday commute times), and you're just changing when they start/end their routes, then I should be fine. If
you're going to run W line trains less frequently, that would negatively impact my ability to use RTD as my way of
getting to/from work.
I'm still a little unclear what the change actually is.
i can get to decatur federal station faster idk?
Without an actual schedule provided its hard to give specific feedback. However, by looking at the proposed
changes to the E Line, the changes would appear to be minor as the new E Line times do not overlap at Union
Station with current W Line service.
It's ok if the scheduled times change as long as the train still comes at consistent and regular times. Although, I
hope this doesn't negatively impact folks who use the bus drop off at Oak Station. It seems that a lot of people
use those busses to transfer to the W line.

I believe there needs to be a d line to union station. Now that the 0 bus is not non-stop and requires a transfer this
make it difficult for residents in the southwest suburb to get into downtown and access the other light rail trains

Timing of this bus is super unreliable. Would be great for it to come more frequently.

0 bus is a pretty good connection to union station to the airport for the growing population near the intersection of
seventh avenue and broadway. Might want to do a little marketing outreach to the apartment complexes popping
up everywhere near this area. i'm trying to use the zero bus more than an Uber to get to Union Station. I think
there are over 1000 new apartments in this area.
The timeliness is not the actual issue here — it’s the constant last-minute cancelling of trips. And the Rider Alerts
are useless if you send them too long after an issue, because that limits our ability to find alternate options while
we’re left waiting. Get and retain more reliable operators, please!

0 bus is my backup since I work in Englewood. And I’ve used it often since the D line hasn’t been running
downtown. A 0L that ran earlier would be nice if it offered less stops
This would make me way late for work. The change is terrible for me.
if it helps drivers stay on schedule, worthwhile change

Why is the route 0 southbound scheduled to leave 3 minutes before the 16 eastbound drops off passengers
needing to head south?
There is no other option that early (before 6am), and I am forced to wait 27-30 minutes for the next route 0 to
show up.
I used to be able to connect from the 16 to the 1, but you axed the final stretch of the 1 and created an art line
which doesn't run that early.
I also used to be able to switch from the 16 to the D line at auraria, but after some time adjustments to the 16, the
D line is leaving just as the 16 arrives at colfax & mariposa. I have no chance.
We simply need more options for riders trying to go southbound from west denver / lakewood before 6 in the
morning.
Better reliability is always good.
The 0 continues to run late despite the decision to split into 0 and 0b.
This also does not take into consideration the delay factored by having to enter Broadway Station through the
northern gate.
The Route 0/0B change has been disaster. The 0 is constantly late coming from downtown to the transfer point for
the 0B in Englewood (by the King Soopers), this is bad at night when those stops are a hive for criminal activity. In
the winter we are left waiting for 30 minutes or more in the snow and cold. This route has become a joke. Plus
there are constant cancellations peer RTD alerts for the 0 and 0B.
The timing could be improved.

The reduced time for the r line from Lincoln to Peoria makes it impossible for me to use the RTD system. I rely on
the r line to take me to and from the Peoria station where I connect with the a line. Unfortunately there's no other
option for me to make my connection without adding and additional 40min to my already long 1h commute. At that
point it really makesmire sense to drive 45min. I moved to Denver and believed that the train was a good option
but with it being unreliable I'm not so sure. I get to the station at 7:15am and most often than not the 7:34am route
is canceled and I sit there until 8;06am waiting for the next ride which puts me to work at 9:15-9:30am and when
that happen the train back at around 6:06pm gets cancelled too.
The description of the service changes isn't descriptive at all

I take the R Line from Nine Mile to Lincoln for work. From what I saw the schedule changes will not affect my
commute. Thank you

The R line needs major improvements. For starters it needs to run every 15 minutes and additionally be time to
be perfectly transferred with the E line and A line. Additionally, relocating the Aurora Metro center along S Sable
avenue rather than along Exhibition avenue will eliminate 3-5 minutes off the R line. A proposed idea could also
be to add a stop at 6th avenue. With this change, the 2nd avenue and Abeline station should be closed given its
new close proximity to the relocated Aurora metro center near the In and Out. The 6th avenue station will replace
the 2nd avenue station, eliminating signal priority of cars along Aurora’s metro center.

If it is to make sure people have adequate time to transfer from R line to E or H, that is good. If it reduces wait

I wish there could be a 0B that would connect with the last 0 bus of the day going southbound of the night,. Now I
must leave downtown on the 11:20pm something 0 bus to make it to Highlands Ranch without getting a ride, or
paying for a.cab/uber/Lyft
if it helps drivers stay on schedule, worthwhile change
There are no details about what the "minor changes" are, so it is impossible to know if or how it will affect me
Better reliability is always good.
The transfers between 0/B seldom work. I am constantly left for up to 1/2 hour waiting to make a transfer. Totally
undependable.
Reliable connection with the 0 would be helpful
idk i dont use ob but i do when i connect to 76
This should be every 15 minutes
Add possible commuter trips to 0B for people going to school and work during peak hours.
While I hope the schedule change allows for more efficient and shorter transfers between 0 and 0B, I do think in
the long term people traveling along the Broadway corridor would be better served by a bus that travels
continuously from Downtown Denver to Highlands Ranch like the 0 bus used to do. In other words, I suggest that
0B be replaced by a new 0L bus that starts in Downtown Denver, continues south of I-25 and Broadway, does not
turn on Englewood Pkwy skipping Englewood Station, and then will serve all the current stops on Broadway from
Hampden to Highlands Ranch like the 0B currently does. The 0 can still travel from Downtown Denver to
Englewood Station as it does now, but the northbound 0 can turn right on Acoma and go down to old Hampden
where it can make one additional stop at Hampden and Broadway for the ease of those transferring to the 0L to
go south. Meanwhile people going to Denver from Highlands Ranch, Littleton, and Centennial will have a
continuous and faster route that doesn't require a transfer at Englewood Station or at Acoma.

Attachment: Attachment L Survey (5233 : January 2026 Service Change)

If you really want to improve this route, we need to go back to when the 0L actually covered a longer distance and
moved more riders across South Denver. People could get to places quicker than the regular route because there
were fewer stops, and it directly connected where the light rail doesn’t serve. Running the B, which still makes just
as many stops as the 0, doesn’t improve the timeliness. You’re just splitting the route so it has less ground to
cover, but it doesn’t make a meaningful difference for anyone’s time. You’ve just added a transfer between routes,
which actually takes people longer… and if either route is late, you have even longer to wait for the next bus
because the connection windows are too short. Adding the 0B was one of your biggest missteps, but if you think
you’ve found a way to improve timing and reliability, we’d love to see that!

Nice bus
Please put more bus on the return to Boulder. It would be really great if there is schedule like 2.45 pm, 3.30, 4.45
and 5.15 pm
Would like westbound bus to have an additional, later departure time in afternoon or to resume the former ~
5:40pm departure time from campus, to accommodate those who work/have class that ends later than 5pm
The westbound 5.15 pm bus delays and sometime the drivers do not know the proper route. For that, the bus get
delayed sometime. Please schedule those drivers who have experience in driving in this route. We also cant track
the 5.15 pm bus and it has become constant for quite sometime

There seems to be a glitch of some sort with the proposed changes -- the weekday times shown are sparse
incomplete.

With the return to office that CU campuses (including the Anschutz Medical campus) are requiring in January
2026, it would be beneficial to have more frequent busses on this route. The proposed changes are focused on
afternoon eastbound trips. It would be wonderful to have an additional morning option during the 7am hour
(maybe a 7:15/7:30am bus?).
I would also propose a 3:30p departure for a westbound bus from campus to Boulder.
Thank you for your consideration.
The proposed schedule appears to be jumbled with AM and PM times mixed up throughout the columns and
rows, but I believe it's intended that there will be a route approximately every 15 minutes and includes a few
different stops. I frequently use the FF1 between Superior and Boulder. Increasing FF5 lines and service points
would provide a different option for me and greatly help to spread out the crowds that take the FF1, which is
frequently standing room only around 4-5pm
The first afternoon bus (17th Pl and Aurora Ct around 2:40 pm) is planned to be removed in 2026. This bus is
always very full and should not be removed.
There are too many buses arriving in the morning to only have 2 buses home in the afternoon. Additionally, it
makes the work day unpleasantly long for those arriving at 6:30 or 6:45 am to not be able to leave until 4:18 pm.
Please do not remove this bus from the schedule.
Link to view proposed schedule does not work.
the ff5 needs a bus heading east that departs closer to 730 am.
The 4:15 and 5:15 buses from Anschutz- 17th place to Boulder are almost full. The campus is coming back full
time in January and we are concerned that the buses will be full. Either another timeslot (like we had prepandemic) would be helpful or an extra bus. Thank you very much for all you do for us!!
to get to colfax station faster and to airport
Increase frequency of the FF2 during weekdays.
The thing that would make the biggest impact on this route, would be to alter the route of the westbound buses in
the afternoon. I have taken this bus for more than 10 years and having the buses take Peoria to 70 to 270 is not
the quickest way. The more experienced bus drivers take 225 N off campus to 70 and they can get into the HOV
lane right away and go 25 to 36. This is MUCH faster and should be the standard route that is taken westbound in
the afternoon. Please make this change and train your drivers so that they take it. They never know where they
are going.

Packet Pg. 97

Please consider that hospital employees who work 12 hr shifts need better access to this route. Adding an option
to arrive Eastbound to Anschutz between 06:15-06:30 / 18:15-18:30. As well as adding an option to depart
Anschutz Westbound at 19:30. Nightshift clocks in /out at 18:45 / 07:15 and Day shift clocks in/out 06:45 / 19:15.

The 4:43 pm LD1 bus from Union Station is late everyday. This is due to it just being late and the shared gate
(b17) that has FF1 is late to leave every day impacting when the LD1 can board. Please ensure to change the
gate due to FF1 being late and it is very co fusing standing in line because there are so many lines forming
around that gate.
The LD1 route needs to run every 30 minutes during peak commute hours (during commute to Denver around 78:30 am and back north around 5-6:30 pm)

I would like to see a LD1 from Denver at earlier than 7 am. Winter is coming and I need reliable service to
Lafayette. I have to take FF1 and take a transfer at Broomfield station. If LL1 is delayed then I can miss LD3.
Coming from Denver, we need a reliable and direct route. Thanks
I can't tell what the schedule changes are for this route.

287 traffic is challenging, weather restrictions, and the main street train tracks - making for a potential missed
connection.
Whitel the schedule changes do not affect me, I hope that you'll reconsider the departure gates from Union
Station Northbound. The current Gate 19 conflicts with FF1 and FF2 northbound buses and the LDI should go
back to departing from Gate 18.
The LD1 is already at the 8th & Coffman Park-n-Ride. Happy to see there is no reduction in service.
I am very thankful for this route. When I moved to Lafayette last year, I had no idea I'd be commuting via RTD to
DTC so much. My only request is that the last LD1 bus leaves from Union Station later than 5:30 pm. I don't like
having to leave work early from Orchard Station to have to catch this last bus home.

I have regularly traveled on this 76 bus primarily between Olde Town Arvada Station and Jewell Avenue, and I
have felt in my view that service along that stretch of Wadsworth needs to be on a 15 minute interval because
there's more people and businesses along that stretch, the half-hour interval does not cut it there. What I suggest
is the 15 minute service can start at Olde Town Arvada Station at the unused Gate D, then it would go south from
there along the same route but then terminate at Wadsworth and Hampden PnR. Or you could have one 76 that
goes from US 36 and Broomfield to Wadsworth and Hampden, and a second one that goes from Olde Town
Arvada to Southwest Plaza, and along the thick of the route the two buses arrive 15 minutes apart from the other.
I think this would improve the efficiency of this route a great deal, especially now that the construction along
Wadsworth in Wheat Ridge is finally winding down.

Attachment: Attachment L Survey (5233 : January 2026 Service Change)

Many people employed at Southwest Plaza Mall (including myself) end our shifts on either the hour :00, or half
hour :30, and for much of the afternoon, 12-13 minutes is a perfectly inconvenient time to try to clock out, gather
our belongings, and get to the bus stop— mostly because you just barely miss it by a few minutes and must wait
the full 30 minutes for the next bus. Perhaps this is a “me” issue, but seeing that the Southwest Plaza is a place of
work for many, the 76 route schedule should be centered around these hourly/half hourly increments. but im just
some guy what do i know lol

It’s nice to have the L line back downtown to access five points. Perhaps it would be more beneficial to have the L

I'm extremely disappointed that this schedule change appears to remove the Sunday and holiday service from
this line (it appears you've removed Sunday/holiday service from every light rail line).

This will allow faster travel to 30th and Downing
I support restoring the L Line service.
nope but now i can access 12 and 7 buses
I am looking forward to normal service being restored after the completion of the downtown rail reconstruction
project. I use this line to get to downtown and connect to other lines such as the E line. I have heard rumors that
the mayor and others at the city want to permanently eliminate service to this line and tear up the track
infrastructure. At a time when Denver needs to drastically reduce its car dependency, doing this would be a
monumental mistake that future generations would judge us harshly for. Please do not do this and instead resume
normal service as soon as possible. Moving forward, this line needs to be connected to the 38th and Blake station
as originally promised. This would increase ridership by enabling connections to the A line and help bring more
foot traffic to businesses along the Welton street corridor.

Attachment: Attachment L Survey (5233 : January 2026 Service Change)

Cutting Sunday/holiday service for all of your light rail lines shows active hostility towards the people that ride your
trains. This shows you do not want to have a functional transit system and that you're trying to push people into
buying and using cars. This is a curfew on the poor that live in Littleton and along the R Line. . Cutting all your
light rail services on Sunday/holidays is truly awful and shows that RTD believes that the people who use their
services are second class citizens that deserve to sit for hours in buses when we could have taken the light rail
and gotten there in 30 minutes. You've shown that you think we don't deserve a functional transit system by
refusing to make your services 24 hours, and you're proving it again by trying to remove a full day of service from
all of the light rail lines.

I'm so disappointed that there is no increase in service, no J service, or any other improvement. I ride the bus
every week, not always at the same time. Whether I board at peak, mid-day, or evening, there are lots of other

Ok so the northbound 4-ish pm bus is leaving later, but there is no change to the morning arrivals to get us there
between 7a and 8:30a? The number of people who would use a 7:45a Union Station arrival LX bus would more
than make up for its scheduling. Why is this ultra-common office start time not accommodated by the rapid transit
route? I don't want to get to Denver an hour earlier so instead I either take the LD1 bus, which takes more time
out of my personal life, or drive myself to Broomfield and use no Longmont buses. I would like a Longmont rapid
transit bus that actually meets my needs, please. I can't be the only one whose day starts at 8am.

When this route was launched in August 2025, the final change stated that there would be three southbound trips
during peak morning hours in addition to two southbound trips during afternoon hours. As well as two northbound
trips during peak morning hours and three northbound trips during peak afternoon hours. So that would be five
trips total for each direction. But each direction only has four trips. So why did the final schedule not match what
the final service change announced?

Strongly approve of this change. It's actually more important for the Southern Hills students to be able to make
the bus after their dismissal (vs. the Fairview kids). Please continue to instruct the bus drivers to wait for kids at
the South Boulder Rec Center stop. The three minute delay should make a big difference in kids making the bus
but as weather gets cold and the walk from Southern Hills to South Boulder Rec gets snowy / icy, a 1-2 minute
look and hold for kids on the way could make a big difference.

to schedule more 206s around the bell schedule instead.

My son could use more time to get to the bus after school ends at Fairview. However I don't think 3 extra minutes
is enough. 10 extra minutes would be better, if the bus left at 3:35pm

Attachment: Attachment L Survey (5233 : January 2026 Service Change)

A morning bus heading to Fairview needs to be added. The kids either arrive at school 30 minutes early or 10
minutes late (due to traffic the 8:00 am bus never arrives on time). A bus that leaves Arapahoe/Conestoga at 7:45
is needed.

This doesn't overlap with Denver connector for my trips, please don't discontinue it.
Please do not remove this service, I rely on it to get to work. Denver connector does not cover where my work is
and I will probably have to stop riding RTD because of this.

It is a shame that bus route has not increased ridership.
i never knew about this but im trying to catch one but i dont know how to catch one dang
I work at 2000 West 3rd Avenue. There is no bus service to this location. The Denver Connector does not service
this location. My only other option is to take the Route 3 to Tejon and walk over half a mile.
I rely on this service in order to get family around; there is no suitable bus alternative in much of the service area.
The map showing the Denver Connector in comparison to PLFX shows how much of the area will become a full
desert for public transportation. I urge you to postpone this change for at least one service change.

Connection getting off a line train and getting on bus south is bad ... Please move to leaving Central Park south a
few minutes
My son goes to Northfield. The final bell doesn't ring until 3:55. The proposed change would mean the bus leaves
before school is out. That defeats the purpose of the change. I could understand moving the current time to 4:26
but not the proposed time.

This time adjustment will be great for Northfield students and families. The bus is already crowded at that time

I didn’t like that RTD took runs away from the 9 route. To begin with starting with Covid that were not brought
back. It was extremely beneficial when the 9 ran once every 30 minutes instead of a hour if you had appointments
that meant leaving an hour or two before since the 9 doesn’t really match up with other routes easily either they
are 15-30 minutes wait times to transfer that is if the 9 is on time otherwise it’s longer not shorter. Also taking trips
away in the morning or evening. Now if I need to get home I need to make sure that I am at a stop no later than 6
going west since you took away two evenings and one morning. Forgot about going downtown after a certain time
since you can not return and the light rail is not a possibility with people with a mobility issue can not go up and
down some of the hills not safe to walk around with poorly lit areas and streets. You know about the hills in the
area since if there is any slight snow the 9 does not come down vrain which has a senior and disabled building at
that stop

When Route 9 had 30 minute service connections were timely for Route 1 at Knox Ct &10th or Route 51 at 10th &

I just hope service times don't drop. The last bus at 6:40 is way to early & if I'm not on that bus I don't get home!
Please leave the 326 schedule as it is. Proposed changes mean people riding the 326 in the morning have to wait
20 minutes in the cold to catch the LD1. That’s not ok.
Northbound also doesn’t align with the LX2 or LD1. People on the LX2 will have to wait 15 minutes to catch it
home.
Not everyone drives to 8th & Coffman, so please be thoughtful and schedule Longmont’s local buses to sync with
the commuter buses from Denver.

BOARD INITIATED ACTION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
RTD and Customer Shared Commitments

November 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
December 2, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt RTD and Customer Shared Commitments and incorporate these
commitments into the on-going Respect the Ride awareness campaign.

REPRESENTATIVE
Kathleen Chandler, Vice Chair Operations, Safety, and Security Committee, Director - District F
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In June of 2023, the Board of Directors adopted a revised Customer Code of Conduct. The Board
subsequently amended the Code of Conduct in September of 2023. In concert with the Board’s actions,
the agency has run an on-going awareness campaign, known as Respect the Ride, which seeks to raise
public awareness around RTD’s Code of Conduct and the agency's goal of creating a safe, convenient,
and enjoyable experience for all customers.
At the March 13, 2024, meeting of the then Operations and Safety Committee, Director Harwick moved
to amend the Committee’s work plan to include a discussion on the development of a Customer Bill of
Rights. That motion, along with the Committee’s 2024–2025 work plan, was unanimously approved.
However, due to other priorities and scheduling constraints, the Committee did not address the
Customer Bill of Rights during that work plan period.
In February 2025, the Operations, Safety, and Security (OSS) Committee adopted its 2025–2026 work
plan, again including a scheduled discussion, initially scheduled for March 2025, regarding a Customer
Bill of Rights. Due to competing demands and turnover among participating Directors, that discussion
was postponed.
In the spring of 2025, Directors Chandler and Paglieri agreed that while a discussion regarding customer
expectations of RTD was valuable, the term Customer Bill of Rights was not the most appropriate
framework. With the support of OSS Chair Ian Harwick, it was determined in July 2025 that the topic
should move forward under a revised title, RTD and Customer Shared Commitments.

Packet Pg. 128

1.D.2

Subsequently, Director Chandler collaborated with Director Paglieri and General Manager and CEO Debra
A. Johnson to prepare a discussion item fulfilling the Committee’s work plan. That collaboration resulted
in a draft document outlining mutual commitments between RTD and its customers, which was
presented to the OSS Committee as a Discussion Item at its October 15, 2025 meeting.
Based on the discussion at the October 15, 2025 meeting, Committee Vice Chair Chandler and
Committee Chair Harwick agreed to have the item return as a Recommended Action for the November
meeting. Additionally, several committee members noted that should the Board approve the Shared
Commitments, the commitments should be published alongside the agency’s Code of Conduct.
DISCUSSION
The Committee is requested to review and vote on the RTD and Customer Shared Commitments.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the approval of this item.

Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office

Packet Pg. 129

Shared Commitments

Overview
Public transportation plays an essential role in connecting people, strengthening communities, and
supporting regional growth. Delivery of RTD’s bus, rail, paratransit, and microtransit services
requires a shared responsibility among the agency, its customers, and communities throughout the
Denver region. The relationship is built on trust, accountability, and mutual expectations.

Objective
The purpose of this pledge of Shared Commitments is to define the responsibilities and requirements
that guide this relationship. It outlines RTD’s purpose in delivering an optimal transit experience, as
well as highlights the roles and obligations of customers to contribute to a welcoming transit
environment.

Expectations
Public transportation is a vital public service, but access to it is not an unlimited right. RTD is
responsible for providing services that are safe, secure, reliable, and accessible, within its defined
service area and financial capacity. In return, customers are expected to adhere to RTD’s Customer
Code of Conduct, which includes paying the required fare, observing safety instructions, treating
others with respect and courtesy, and refraining from disruptive behaviors that interfere with
services.
RTD’s commitments and those of its customers are built upon mutual expectations and
reciprocal responsibilities.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Transit Police Update

November 12, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Steve Martingano, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2021, the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) submitted a written request to the
American Public Transportation Association (APTA) for a peer review of the existing RTD Security
Model. APTA accepted the request and convened a peer review panel of highly experienced transit
policing leaders. Implementation of the panel’s recommendations has been led by the Chief of Police and
Emergency Management. This report describes ongoing operational and strategic changes and those
anticipated over the next several years.
DISCUSSION
The strategy for the Regional Transportation District Police Department (RTD-PD) is focused on the
following:
1. High Visibility Patrol Assignments
2. Education on the RTD Customer Code of Conduct
3. Emphasis on Fare Enforcement
4. Utilization of Advancing Technologies
The framework for the enhancement of the RTD-PD community policing, Back to Basics, People Power,
and Welcoming Transit Environment strategies are described herein within the context of four topical
areas discussed in depth in the associated presentation:
1. Strategic Implementation
2. Evidence-Based Policing
3. Strategic Priority Alignment
4. Performance Data Outputs
Community Policing
RTD-PD continues to assume a more visible and active role in improving overall public safety throughout
the transit environment, through the ongoing phased hiring of sworn officers, and while remaining
sensitive to societal issues. This approach leads to a Welcoming Transit Environment for customers and
employees.

Packet Pg. 133

1.E.1

Increasing police-stakeholder engagement also includes the expansion of key partnerships with agencies
throughout the service area, facilitating a more coordinated multi-agency approach to improving law
enforcement and public safety outcomes. As RTD-PD becomes a more active participant in proactively
addressing regional criminal and social challenges, additional hiring of sworn personnel allows the agency
to expand its reach, while 24-hour staffing will meet customer and employee safety expectations.
Examples of RTD-PD’s expansion benefits include:
• All members of the command staff are undergoing intensive background clearances checks for
participation in the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force (FBI-JTTF)
• Active connections with social service providers to meet specific sector needs
• Meeting with police agencies in surrounding jurisdictions to improve collaboration that will benefit
everyone in the community and the RTD service area
• Partnering with Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct laboratory testing, associated
with narcotics arrests
People Power
As of today, there are 94 sworn officers and an additional 10 police recruits attending the police
academy that concludes in December 2025. The department has 46 authorized positions to hire by end
of year 2025, to include additional lateral police officers who are Colorado Peace Officer Standards and
Training certified and recruits to enter the January 2026 academies.
As RTD-PD continues to transition toward a police workforce that includes a majority of sworn
personnel, it is becoming better positioned to:
• Build stronger community relationships
• Mitigate conditions conducive to crime
• Expand its capacity to serve those with mental health, addiction, and housing struggles without
over-criminalizing non-chronic offenders
Welcoming Transit Environment
Recent accomplishments in applying the four-step action plan to affect crime are highly positive
indicators of the approach recommended by the peer review panel, and they have enabled RTD-PD
command staff to engage in more creative deployment strategies to address crimes and aberrant
behaviors.
An example is the consistent decrease in crime trends reported in targeted areas like Denver Union
Station (DUS). The decrease in criminal incidents at DUS demonstrates how a strategic and intentional
reinvestment in personnel – in the form of transitioning from contracted security guards to sworn police
officers and upgrades to the hardware and use of technology in facilities – benefits the agency, its
employees, and its customers.
