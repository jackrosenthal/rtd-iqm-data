Award Contract to Purchase Video Event
Recorders for Bus Safe Driving Management

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award the contract to SmartDrive Systems of San
Diego, CA, for the purchase of up to 600 event recorder systems and five (5) years of managed services
to host and review data, provide event management in web application and produce driving behavior
reports to allow coaching of drivers on safe driving and accident reduction.
BACKGROUND
The safe driving management system is made up of onboard recording equipment and back office data
review and evaluation. The onboard equipment consists of an event recorder mounted on the bus
windshield with outward and inward facing cameras controlled by an onboard computer. The system
records video, audio, GPS location, speed, and accelerations in all three axes. The system saves data 15
seconds before and 15 seconds after an event. An event is triggered either automatically by preset
parameters, like g-forces being out of normal range signifying an impact or unusual maneuver of some
sort, or by the driver manually initiating the recording. Data for these events are uploaded to the service
provider each night and reviewed for the cause and severity of the event. The information is filtered,
prioritized and then fed back to RTD to enable effective coaching with the drivers.
Driver coaching based on data from video-based data recorders has been shown to reduce risky driving
behaviors. Poor behaviors can be addressed and good behaviors reinforced. The coaching process to
reduce poor driving behaviors will result in fewer accidents, more comfortable rides, and safer buses. In
addition, the system has been shown to provide objective data to document the cause of accidents for
reducing false claims.
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on June 11, 2013 for the procurement of a Video-Based
Fleet Safety Management Solution.

DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from two (2) companies: SmartDrive Systems and DriveCam. The proposals
were rated according to their proposed costs and company technical ability. SmartDrive was the lowest
cost proposal. It also showed compliance with RTD's technical requirements, to include the provisions
for connecting systems to our onboard mobile router for data transfer to WIFI cloud available in each of
the bus garages, and interfacing with RTD's new CAD/AVL system to retrieve driver assignment data.
DriveCam's system is lacking the WIFI transfer. It uses a cellular connection for data transfer, which
requires recurring cellular phone fees and contributes to their higher proposed cost. In addition, their
proposal did not detail how they would document driver bus assignments.

RTD has used two approaches to reduce the cost of this system. First, RTD requires the integration
with the existing onboard mobile router for daily data transfer via WIFI cloud, thus eliminating recurring
cellular fees. Second, RTD will use in-house personnel for the equipment installations.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

This contract is for the purchase of up to 600 sets of onboard equipment and five years of managed
services to host and review event data, manage the events in a web application, and provide reports and
program reviews. The funding for the equipment purchase is approved and available in the District's
2013 Adopted Budget. Funding for year one is included in the District's 2014 Proposed Budget and the
following years will be included on an ongoing basis. Total not to exceed costs are $268,055 for the
equipment and $201,600 per year for five (5) years of managed services.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There was no DBE requirement for work performed under this contract.

ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to award a contract to SmartDrive Systems for the purchase of up
to 600 event recorder systems and for five (5) years of managed services to host and review data,
provide event management in web application and provide reports. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Award the contract to the DriveCam, the second high rated proposal. This is not the recommended
action as it would contradict with RTD's procurement practice.
3. Do not authorize the award of the contract. This is not desirable as it would not provide the expected
safety benefit to our drivers, passengers and communities.
4. Do not authorize the award of the contract and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay in the expected benefits and may increase the cost of the project.

Award of Access-a-Ride Services Contracts

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into contracts for the provision of Access-aRide services using dedicated (RTD owned) vehicles with MV Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines, and
Via Mobility Services. These contracts are for three years, with two one-year options for a 5-year, with
a cumulative not-to-exceed cost of $145,700,972 for Access-a-Ride service and $28,125,117 for
Access-a-Ride fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $173,826,089. The contract amounts by
service provider are as follows: MV Transportation - $66,279,862 for service, $14,062,559 for fuel,
for a total not-to-exceed amount of $80,342,421; Horizon Coach Lines - $42,484,584 for service,
$7,031,279 for fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $49,515,863; and Via Mobility Services $36,936,526 for service, $7,031,279 for fuel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $43,967,805. The
committee further recommends that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his
designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of Access-a-Ride services with non-dedicated
(contractor provided) vehicles with Veolia Transportation on Demand. This contract is for three years,
with two one-year options for a total 5-year, not-to-exceed amount of $9,811,727. Fuel for this
contract is included in the total contract price. These proposals represent the most responsive and
responsible proposals received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-DH-035, to provide
Access-a-Ride Services.
BACKGROUND
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public entities operating a fixed route system
also provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities that is comparable to the level of service
provided to individuals without disabilities. RTD adheres to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Part
37 regulations (Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities) which regulate paratransit services. All
policies regarding services were developed in concert with a citizen advisory committee comprised of
individuals from the disabled community. The original design of the Access-a-Ride program was adopted
by the RTD Board of Directors and was forwarded to the Federal Transit Administration for their
approval.
The current Access-a-Ride structure consists of one Call Center Contractor and four Service Provider
Contractors. First Transit operates the Call Center while Global Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines,
MV Transportation, and Via Mobility Services provide the service. In addition, all paratransit eligibility
functions are handled under contract with Easter Seals of Colorado. The current Access-a-Ride service
provider contracts are currently scheduled to expire December 31, 2013.
On August 16, 2013, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services. Proposers had the option of bidding on 50%, 25%,
or 16.6% of the Access-a-Ride service and up to two packages of Call-n-Ride service. This service
represents the re-bid of service currently provided by Global Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines, MV
Transportation, and Via Mobility Services. The RFP was available on the RTD external website for public

Packet Pg. 7

1.C.2

download. In addition, announcements were placed in transit publications. Proposals were due on
September 20, 2013.
DISCUSSION
Twelve (12) proposals were received in response to RFP 13-DH-035 for the Provision of Access-a-Ride
services. Proposals were received from Apple Bus Company, First Transit, Global Transportation, Horizon
Coach Lines, McDonald Transit Associates, MV Transportation, Ride Right, SCR Medical Transportation,
Trinity Transit, Veolia Transportation and Veolia Transportation on Demand (separate proposals for both
dedicated and non-dedicated vehicle service), and Via Mobility Services (formerly known as Special
Transit).
It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 13-DH-035, that RTD award contracts for the Access-a-Ride service provision to MV
Transportation (50% of the revenue hours), Horizon Coach Lines (25% of the revenue hours), and Via
Mobility Services (25% of the revenue hours). This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the
proposals according to the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The
evaluative criteria established for this procurement were: a) understanding/approach and organization for
implementation (40%); b) experience of firm and individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines
(25%); c) Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d) price (30%).
The evaluation team consisted of Larry Buter, Manager, Paratransit Services; Maria Christian,
Technician, Contracted Services; Steve Gieske, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Kenn
Hardin, Senior Manager, Civil Rights; Pat Heye, Senior Alternative Service Planner / Scheduler; Brian
Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Chris Sills, Paratransit Safety and Training Compliance Officer;
Joy Volz, Paratransit Quality Assurance Supervisor; and Mac Weeden, Senior Quality Control Inspector.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the
twelve proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the
evaluative criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach”
and for “Experience and Proposed Key Positions.” “SBE Submittal and Compliance” was evaluated and
scored by the Civil Rights Division. The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was calculated
by the RTD procurement staff and was then added to the technical score and the SBE score of each
proposal to determine the overall score or rating of each proposal.
The key strengths of each proposal are as follows:
Apple Bus Company – previous experience with a similar sized system.
First Transit – previous experience, proposed installation of DriveCam system, comprehensive training
and maintenance program.
Global Transportation – incumbent, good training program, no start up.
Horizon Coach Lines – incumbent, good maintenance program, no start up.
McDonald Transit Associates – good maintenance program and quality control systems.
MV Transportation – incumbent, proposed new technologies to monitor service, good maintenance and
training program.
Ride Right – previous experience with a similar sized system.
SCR Medical Transportation – previous experience, good training and quality control systems.
Trinity Transit – previous experience with Access-a-Ride Project Management.

Packet Pg. 8

1.C.2

Veolia Transportation (dedicated vehicle) – previous experience, good maintenance plan, good training
program.
Veolia Transportation on Demand (non-dedicated vehicle) – existing provider, limited start up, offers
scheduling flexibility.
Via Mobility Services – incumbent, strong maintenance and training, no start-up.
The key weaknesses of each proposal are as follows:
Apple Bus Company – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
First Transit – requires start up activities.
Global Transportation – proposed Maintenance Manager, not acceptable to RTD, maintenance plan
undeveloped.
Horizon Coach Lines – expansion to 25% service levels would require facility relocation.
McDonald Transit Associates – several key personnel did not meet minimum requirements.
MV Transportation – high turn-over rate.
Ride Right – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
SCR Medical Transportation – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
Trinity Transit – proposal failed to address all operational requirements.
Veolia Transportation (dedicated vehicle) – proposed Maintenance Manager has limited experience at the
25% service level.
Veolia Transportation on Demand (non-dedicated vehicle) – limited quality control.
Via Mobility Services – operational logistics concerns at the 25% service level.
The total overall scores regardless of the proposed service model, including SBE rating and cost rating
were as follows:
MV Transportation –
Via Mobility –
First Transit –
Horizon Coach Lines –
Veolia (dedicated) –
Global Transportation –
McDonald –
SCR –
Ride Right –
Apple Bus Co –
Trinity Transit –
Veolia (non-dedicated) –

Veolia was the only proposer to bid on the non-dedicated vehicle option.

An evaluation of the total program cost was made by identifying the firms that scored in the competitive
range and then comparing the proposed prices for the 50%, 25%, and16.6% service levels. The service
model deemed most advantageous to the District in terms of both quality and cost resulted in a
combination of one 50% provider (MV Transportation) and two 25% providers (Via Mobility and Horizon
Coach Lines). It was the consensus of the evaluation team that these firms presented the best proposals
in terms of the understanding of the project, proposed management team, proposed organization,
approach to deliver the requested service, attainment of SBE goals and proposed price.
The evaluation team also considered maintaining the current four provider model. Using the costs
provided by the lowest priced service provider for the 50% service level plus the lowest prices of the

Packet Pg. 9

1.C.2

three service providers in the competitive range for the 16.6% service level, resulted in an overall
program cost increase of $4.5 million dollars over the five-year contract term. However, the evaluation
team had questions regarding changing the service model from four contractors to three and increasing
the proposed providers from a 16.6% to a 25% service level. Oral presentations were conducted with
the firms in the competitive range for the provision of 25% service model: Horizon Coach Lines, Veolia
Transportation (dedicated vehicle), and Via Mobility Services. The purpose of the oral presentations was
to offer these firms an opportunity to further articulate their operating plan and to respond to the
questions of the evaluation team. Furthermore, Veolia Transportation on Demand (non-dedicated
vehicle) was invited to provide clarification on the non-dedicated vehicle approach to providing Access-aRide services. At the conclusion of the oral presentations, the evaluation team again met and concluded
that the three provider service model represented the best model for the District and our passengers.
Therefore, the recommendation of the evaluation committee was to contract with MV Transportation to
provide 50% of the revenue hours, Horizon Coach Lines to provide 25% of the revenue hours, and Via
Mobility Services to provide 25% of the revenue hours; and to contract with Veolia Transportation to
provide non-dedicated-vehicle Access-a-Ride service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the recommended
firms’ proposals represent the most responsive and responsible proposals received in response to the
RFP issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of technical, SBE and price
issues consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and communicated in the RFP
document.
An RTD internal financial analysis indicated that the estimated cost to provide these services would be
higher than the prices offered by the recommended service providers. The estimated cost was based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses. The financial comparison of the top
three proposals at the 50% and 25% service levels to the top four proposals at the 50% and 16.6%
resulted in the three provider model yielding a $4.5 million dollar savings to the District over the fiveyear contract term.
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the 2014 requested
budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)
2)

3)

Award contracts to Horizon Coach Lines, MV Transportation, and Via Mobility Services,
and Veolia Transportation on Demand as recommended.
Maintain current levels of service, one 50% service provider and three (3) 16.6% service
providers for an additional cost of $4.5 million dollars. This is not recommended as it does
not reflect the outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation process.
Resolicit the RFP. This is not recommended as the proposal process has resulted in a
responsive and responsible proposal and is less expensive than the RTD internal cost
estimate (ICE).

Amendment of ADA Contracts for Call-n-Ride
Service Awards

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the new ADA paratransit services contracts
with MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services (per solicitation #13-DH-035) for the provision of Calln-Ride services. The amendment to the MV Transportation contract is for three years, with two one-year
options and shall not exceed $19,039,885 for the 5-year period for Call-n-Ride services. The
amendment to the Via Mobility Services contract is also for three years, with two one-year options and
shall not exceed $8,692,084 for the 5-year period for Call-n-Ride services. In addition, these contracts
will include a cost for fuel which will be treated as a pass through expense. The total 5-year estimated
cost for Call-n-Ride fuel for MV Transportation is $3,333,539 and for Via Mobility Services is
$1,380,399. The total 5-year not-to-exceed cost for MV Transportation is $22,373,424. The total 5year not-to-exceed cost for Via Mobility Services is $10,072,483.
BACKGROUND
On August 16, 2013, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services. Call-n-Ride services were included in the Access-aRide services RFP because these services had been assigned to and were operated by ADA paratransit
service providers under the existing contracts. Past experience has shown that the cost of Call-n-Ride
service is lower when combined with Access-a-Ride service because of reduced overhead costs.
All of the existing Call-n-Ride services (with the exception of the Evergreen CNR) were divided into three
(3) service packages and proposers were allowed to bid on one or two packages. Proposers were
required to bid on Access-a-Ride service in order to also bid on Call-n-Ride service (Call-n-Ride service
was not a “stand alone” service option). Proposers were not required to submit a separate proposal for
Call-n-Ride service, but they were required to detail how they would address the unique operational
requirements of the service.
The Call-n-Rides included in each package are as follows:
Package A
Arapahoe
Belleview
Dry Creek
Highlands Ranch
Lone Tree
Meridian
North Inverness
Orchard
Parker

Package B
Belmar
Golden
Green Mountain
South Jeffco

Package C
Brighton

Packet Pg. 12

1.C.3

South Inverness
The new contracts for ADA paratransit service include the option for the assignment of Call-n-Ride
service so that Call-n-Ride service can be assigned to those contracts.
DISCUSSION
Subsequent to the evaluation of the Access-a-Ride RFP responses and recommendation for contract
award, the Call-n-Ride proposals were evaluated. Only proposers that were recommended to provide
Access-a-Ride service were considered to provide Call-n-Ride services. The Call-n-Ride proposals were
evaluated on the following criteria: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation
(40%); b) experience of firm and individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines (25%); c) Small
Business Enterprise (SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d) price (30%).
Via Mobility Services, formally known as Special Transit, has operated Call-n-Ride service for
approximately twelve years. The management team is well experienced in the provision of Call-n-Ride
service. Via Mobility currently provides Call-n-Ride service from a facility in the Boulder area and a
facility in the Denver area. This allows a quicker response time in case of vehicle maintenance problems
and cuts down on excessive deadhead mileage and fuel expenses.
MV Transportation has operated Call-n-Ride service for approximately ten years. MV Transportation
proposed a team comprised of experienced Call-n-Ride managers and drivers, and it has provided quality
Call-n-Ride service throughout its tenure. The MV Transportation facility is located in the south metro
area which provides good access for the Call-n-Rides in service packages A & B.
Horizon Coach Lines does not have any experience operating Call-n-Ride service for RTD. Horizon’s
initial RFP response provided pricing for Call-n-Ride package C. During the follow up interview with the
Horizon team, the organization identified that it had intended to bid on package B, not package C. In
addition to this oversight, the Horizon proposal provided very limited discussion on the operation of the
Call-n-Ride and the proposed Call-n-Ride Supervisor had limited experience managing this type of service.
The evaluation of the Call-n-Ride service proposals and pricing resulted in a recommendation to assign
Call-n-Ride Packages A and B to MV Transportation under the ADA paratransit contract and Call-n-Ride
Package C to Via Mobility Services under the ADA paratransit contract. The contracts to provide these
services are scheduled to be effective April 1, 2014.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the 2014 requested
budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)

Assign Call-n-Ride service to MV Transportation and Via Mobility as recommended. This is
recommended as both contractors’ personnel have Call-n-Ride experience and can provide
the direct supervision for a smooth contract transition.

Packet Pg. 13

1.C.3

2)

Assign Call-n-Ride service to another ADA paratransit contractor. This alternative is not
recommended as the other contractor will be experiencing an increase in their Access-aRide revenue hours and this will be a new service for them. This would also contradict the
results of the evaluation process.

Award Contract to Supply 125 – 40’ LowFloor Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to Gillig LLC for the purchase of 125 – 40’ low-floor
transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed $51,800,000, with an option to
purchase up to 307 additional 40’ buses over a five year period.
BACKGROUND
RTD’s existing 2000 Series Orion 40’ transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years or 500,000
miles. The buses are coming up to 14 years old and have accumulated on average 585,000 miles of stop-andgo transit service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
The bus manufacturer, Orion Bus Industries, went out of business a few years ago. Many components for bus
repair have become difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for the replacement of
the 2000 Series buses over the next three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110 buses in 2014, 64 buses in 2015 and
10 buses per year afterward.
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on May 24, 2013 for the procurement of 40’ transit buses. The
RFP solicited proposals that offer buses in different power configurations: clean diesel, CNG and hybrid
electric. Proposals were received on September 4, 2013.
DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from four companies: Gillig, New Flyer, Nova Bus, and North American Bus Industries
(NABI).
The proposers submitted their costs as follows.

$665,570 (Parallel Hybrid)

Staff has performed a life cycle cost analysis of the different power configurations to determine the most cost
effective and efficient propulsion power system for the new buses.
The hybrid buses are $166,565 (for the series hybrid) or $191,419 (for the parallel hybrid) higher in unit cost
than the diesel buses. Accordingly, RTD would only be able to purchase 85 to 89 hybrid buses for the available
budget instead of the 125 replacement vehicles desired.
Based on RTD’s experience of 20% better fuel economy for the hybrid buses and its current diesel fuel
purchase price, it would take between 31 and 36 years to reach the break-even point on the capital
investment for hybrid buses. This far exceeds the twelve (12) year useful life of the vehicle. Accordingly, hybrid
vehicles were eliminated from further consideration.
The CNG buses are $47,960 higher in unit cost than the diesel buses. Accordingly, RTD would only be able
to purchase 112 CNG buses for the available budget instead of 125 replacement vehicles desired.
In order to convert to CNG operations, RTD must also invest in new CNG stations and safety modifications
of existing maintenance and parking facilities. Since the 40’ buses will be distributed to all three RTD’s
divisions and four private operators’ divisions, all seven divisions would have to be modified for CNG. The
CNG stations required for fueling CNG vehicles at seven divisions are estimated to cost upward of $17.3
Million. The facility modifications to these divisions to bring them into compliance with fire codes for safe
operations of CNG fuel are estimated to cost up to $31.4 Million. The total facility upgrades for the seven
divisions are estimated to result in a $48.7 million investment. No funding has been identified to finance
these necessary capital improvements.
Currently, CNG fuel cost is equal to about 50% of diesel fuel cost. Based on the RTD’s average year to date
purchase prices of $3.26 per gallon of diesel and $1.62 per diesel gallon equivalent of CNG, together with
the assumption that the price differential between diesel fuel and CNG fuel would stay the same
throughout the future years under this analysis, it would take 13 years to reach the break-even point on
the capital investment for CNG buses and required facility upgrades.

The CNG analysis by staff indicates:

Savings in CNG fuel cost will be more than offset by the higher cost of bus purchase and
upgrading the maintenance and parking facilities.

Prices of natural gas and diesel fuel have been historically extremely volatile. There is no
guarantee that the current pricing advantage of natural gas over diesel fuel will continue into the
future. Examples of the price volatility are shown below.


There are no significant air quality impacts to convert from diesel to CNG operations. Both new
clean diesel and new CNG buses have significantly lower emissions than the older buses they replace.
The emissions of new clean diesel and CNG buses are considered to be the same.

The CNG facility upgrade will take at least two years to implement. Going with CNG buses will
delay the bus procurement process at least two years.

In the past CNG buses showed higher maintenance costs than diesel buses. However, in the
last several years, CNG engine technology has improved. Even though CNG buses require certain new
costs for CNG related maintenance such as CNG engine sparkplug replacement and high pressure fuel
system maintenance, staff has assumed CNG and diesel maintenance costs to be equivalent.

The reliability and durability of CNG engines are still questionable at high altitude and cold
weather conditions, coupled with the usage of low energy natural gas available in Denver metro area.
High altitude conditions cause loss of engine power and hotter engine operating temperature. Cold
weather causes CNG engine starting problems. Denver’s natural gas has lower energy content than the
rest of the country. Low energy gas causes engine operating issues.

CNG is a combustible gas at very high pressure (3,600 pounds per square inch of pressure).
Safety and security for the operation of CNG are of concern.

The high cost CNG stations and associated facility upgrades may become obsolete in 12 years at
the end of life of the buses under this procurement. Electric vehicle technology appears to be the
preferred technology of the future. A number of electric buses are currently in production or under
demonstration by bus manufacturers. As electric bus technology is still in its infancy, it currently has
issues such as high purchase cost and low operating range. In the upcoming years, it is expected that
the technology will advance and production processes will improve, allowing the bus cost to come
down and the operating range to increase.
There are risks that the very large investment in CNG facility upgrades and CNG buses may not pay off; that
the savings on CNG fuel may not be realized due to commodity price fluctuations; that the CNG technology
may become obsolete to better engine technologies currently being demonstrated such as electric vehicles;
and that CNG operational difficulties may be experienced under RTD’s high altitude, cold climate and low
energy natural gas usage. In addition, no funding has been indentified to finance the CNG facility upgrades.

1.C.4

Based on the above considerations, staff has recommended that RTD stay with clean diesel technology as a
good public policy.
The proposals were also rated according to their proposed costs and company technical ability.
Gillig submitted the lowest cost proposal, which is also rated highly for its technical ability. Gillig’s proposal is
the most responsive, responsible, lowest cost and best value proposal. Gillig meets and exceeds RTD technical
specification requirements. Gillig has the experience and qualification in the manufacture of transit buses,
being one of the oldest and most financially stable manufacturers in North America. Gillig offered a lifetime
warranty against bus structure corrosion damage. Gillig proposed a delivery schedule that meets RTD’s 12month delivery schedule requirement.
The 40’ buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be equipped with a
wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. Their clean diesel engines will
meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90% from the level of the existing
buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger count system and a security digital camera
system. The 40’ buses will have two passenger doors and 36 passenger seats.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This current contract is for the purchase of 125-40’ low-floor transit buses and associated spare components
in the amount not to exceed $51,800,000. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the
District’s 2013 Adopted Budget, and also identified in 2014 Requested Budget.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a five year period. Pricing for
additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment
computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is published monthly.
Additional buses to be purchased from the options will require separate authorizations from the RTD Board of
Directors.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required proposal
submittal documents, Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES


To authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Gillig for the purchase of 125 clean diesel 40’
low-floor transit buses and associated spare components. This is the recommended alternative.



Award the contract to Gillig for a smaller quantity of CNG 40’ buses (112 buses) with the available
budget. This is not the recommended action as it would delay the bus purchase from one to two years
due to the long process to construct the CNG fuel stations and modify the maintenance and parking

Packet Pg. 18

1.C.4

facilities. CNG requires higher bus purchase costs and multi-million dollar facility costs, which will
offset the CNG fuel savings. There are risks of operational difficulty for CNG buses in RTD’s high
altitude and cold weather conditions, in addition to the availability of only low energy natural gas in
Denver metro area. In addition, no funding has been identified to finance the necessary capital
improvements.


Do not authorize the award of the contract and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would result,
at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Paratransit Service Extension and Funds

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to extend contracts with Horizon Coach Lines and Global Transportation
for the provision of Access-a-Ride services and with Via Mobility Services and MV Transportation for the
provision of Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services for a period of three (3) months at the following notto-exceed costs. For Access-a-Ride services: Horizon Coach Lines – service $1,385,003, fuel
$207,513, total $1,592,516; Global Transportation – service $1,343,251, fuel $207,513, total
$1,550,764; Via Mobility Services – service $1,386,102, fuel $207,513, total $1,593,615; MV
Transportation – service $3,676,213, fuel $622,543, total $4,298,756. For Call-n-Ride services: Via
Mobility Services – service $358,632, fuel $60,444, total $419,076; MV Transportation – service
$824,052, fuel $150,659, total $974,711. The cumulative total not-to-exceed costs are as follows:
Access-a-Ride service $7,790.570, Access-a-Ride fuel $1,245,081 and Access-a-Ride total
$9,035,650; and Call-n-Ride service $1,182,685, Call-n-Ride fuel $207,356 and Call-n-Ride total
$1,390,040.

BACKGROUND
In June of 2012 the RTD Board of Directors approved a one (1) year extension to the Access-a-Ride
service contracts with MV Transportation, Global Transportation, VIA Mobility, and Horizon Coach
Lines.
The extension also included the Call-n-Ride services which were assigned to MV
Transportation and Via Mobility. The extension was approved, in part, to allow staff to fully analyze
the benefits of utilizing non-dedicated vehicles for a portion of the Access-a-Ride service.
Approximately two years ago, several Board Members requested that an evaluation be conducted
with respect to a relatively new concept of offering paratransit services via non-dedicated vehicles.
While the usage of non-dedicated vehicles has been a viable form of transportation within the taxi
and human services arena, their use within the strictly enforced parameters of ADA paratransit had
not yet been fully demonstrated or analyzed. During the last two years, staff had been critically
assessing new service delivery models to include the possibility of incorporating non-dedicated
vehicles as a resource.
Non-Dedicated Service operates with vehicles that do not provide
transportation exclusively for a particular service such as Access-a-Ride, but are also used to
transport other passengers when not engaged in providing paratransit service. These drivers and
vehicles are in essence, hired for a particular time and when released, continue to use their vehicles
for other matters.

DISCUSSION
Subsequent to the recent procurement of the Access-a-Ride service and the recommendation by staff
to move from four (4) dedicated vehicle providers to three (3) dedicated vehicle providers and one (1)

Packet Pg. 20

1.C.5

non-dedicated vehicle provider, an extension of three (3) months is being requested in order to
facilitate a smooth transition to the new service model. Two of the dedicated-vehicle providers will
be increasing their service level from 16.6% of the Access-a-Ride service to 25%. This will require
increases in driver, mechanic and staff levels and modifications to operating facilities. A three (3)
month extension to the existing Access-a-Ride contracts will provide adequate time for the
contractors to accomplish these tasks.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no budgetary impact as these funds have been budgeted for in the 2014 requested budget.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
RTD’s Treasury Department has taken ownership of the installation of additional platform validators at
various locations throughout the RTD light rail system. Due to budgetary constraints some of the
planned installations are being delayed until 2014. By the end of 2013 the platform validators at Colfax
and Auraria will be moved to more convenient locations. New and improved network connectivity will be
installed at Sports Authority Field, and additional validators will be installed at 30th and Downing. In
2014 platform validators will be installed at Southmoor, 16th and Stout, Orchard and 27th and Welton.
Over 35 Street Supervisors attended a series of 6 classes focused on the use of the Handheld Smart
Media Reader to scan SmartCards. 98% of those scheduled to attend participated in the training.
In partnership with Xerox, the SMT Program Team continues to work on Phase 1 improvements and has
defined the scope of changes in the following areas:
 Ticket Management changes that will help manage requests for assistance with SmartCard.
 Increased search capabilities within the web portal
 Inventory Management changes that will create a better audit train of SmartCard transfers from
one warehouse to another.
Other activities that are under way include
 EcoPass Card Renewal will be completed by 12/31/13
 ADA compliance improvements on existing platform validators
 Development of a Disaster Recovery Outline and Plan

sales machines to report sales more consistently. If this test
proves successful, more work can be planned for 2014 in an
effort to change all cellular connectivity to hardwired network
connectivity.
A new Braille sticker for the platform validators has been
designed and printed in-house using technology that exists in
RTD’s print shop. The new sticker will be reviewed by
members of the Coalition for the Blind to obtain their
feedback during a meeting in December.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the governing body
by October 15, 2013. By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2014
Requested Budget for public review on October 13, 2013. A public hearing to solicit formal
public comment is scheduled for the November 26, 2013 regular meeting of the Board of
Directors.
DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2014 Recommended Budget (combined
Base and FasTracks) is $1,726.4 million. This includes an operating budget of $529.5 million
including interest expense of $99.4 million, capitalized interest of $45.0 million, new capital
expenditures of $870.3 million, debt payments of $61.5 million, FasTracks contingency reserve
of $30.0 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $21.4 million, Board appropriated fund
of $26.5 million, capital replacement fund of $19.3 million, and estimated unrestricted fund
balance of $23.4 million. The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $1,063.2
million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,789.6 million.
Overview of the 2014 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues on a combined basis of $996.5 million are expected to increase $43.3 million (4.5%)
in 2014 over the 2013 Amended Budget. The increase is composed primarily of increases in
fare revenue of $5.6 million and sales/use tax revenue of $37.4 million, offset by a small
decrease in grant revenue of $3.8 million.
Total Base System grants are projected to decrease by $3.9 million, including new and carry
forward amounts. Drawdowns on Base System grants totaled $85.0 million in 2013; new grant

Packet Pg. 29

2.B.1

funding of $81.1 million is projected for 2014. FasTracks grants will essentially remain flat from
2013 due to same level of FFGA funding for the Eagle project, increases in corridor grants for
the US 36 project and the Downtown Circulator, and carry forward funding for the West Line.
Farebox revenues are budgeted to increase $5.6 million or 4.7% based on 2.8% growth in
ridership coupled with a full year of West Line operations in 2014. Sales and use tax revenues
are expected to increase 5.9% over the 2013 projected level according to the most recent
September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Operating expenditures on a combined basis will be down by $25.2 million overall in 2014 from
the 2013 Amended Budget. The decrease is largely due to: 1) completion of FasTracks projects,
2) higher capitalization of FasTracks project salaries, 3) decline in contract maintenance in
FasTracks due to project completion, carryforward, or expense/capital transfers, and 4) reduction
of $11.0 million for a one-time 2013 DUS contribution, offset by: 5) full-year of West Line
operations, and 6) expense projects carry-forward from 2013 totaling $14.1 million. The
expense project carryforward to 2014 is $12.2 million for Base operations and $1.9 million for
FasTracks.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at $3.26 per gallon, which is the same price that was locked in 2013 for
no incremental change. Gasoline is budgeted at $3.54/gallon, which is the same price that was
budgeted in 2013 for no incremental change.
The major changes in operating expense comparing the Recommended Budget to the previous
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget are the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2014 is budgeted at $99.4 million which is an increase of $19.9 million over
the 2013 Amended Budget. Of the interest expense amount, Base system interest will decrease
$3.0 million due to full year impact of refundings of existing debt at lower interest rates
completed in 2013 offset by new COPs issued in 2013. FasTracks interest expense will
increase $22.9 million due to full-year payments on the I-225 corridor revenue bonds and
estimates for interest expense on new debt issued (see Principal payments below). Capitalized
interest (combined) will increase by $3.9 million to $45.0 million due to continuing completion of
FasTracks construction. Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest
payments in 2014.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $61.5 million. This is an increase of $15.0 million
over the 2013 Amended Budget due to 1) issuance in the second half of 2013 of FasTracks
revenue bonds for I-225 expansion and Base System COPs for fleet purchases and 2) issuance of
new debt in 2014. Debt proceeds of $720 million are anticipated in 2014 from new debt for
FasTracks consisting of $400 million in revenue bonds for the North Metro rail line, $240 million
in GARVEE interim debt, and $80 million in TIFIA loan draws for the Eagle Project construction.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2013 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2014. The
capital carry-forward will be $1,063.2 million made up of $181.0 million on the Base System
and $882.1 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending on a combined basis will increase $103.0 million from the 2013 Amended
Budget due mainly to project construction in FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will

Packet Pg. 30

2.B.1

increase $129.9 million to $773.1 million in 2014 due to project construction on I-225, North
Metro, and the Eagle project. For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $26.9
million to $97.2 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $10.3 million less in capital
support projects in IT, security, and operations, $19.8 million less on fleet
modernization/expansion, and $6.6 million less on capital support equipment including reductions
in vehicles and maintenance equipment and 16th Street Mall repair local dollars. These
reductions will be offset by $4.8 million more on park-n-ride projects primarily Stapleton, $5.1
million more on LRT transit projects including crossover work, track maintenance equipment,
event recorders, and ADA highblock replacement, and $0.4 million on DUS bus box emergency
barriers.
New capital expenditures for 2014 and the change in new capital in the 2014 Recommended
Budget over the previous 2014 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in
Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2014 and the change in the capital
carry-forward in the 2014 Recommended Budget over the 2013 Amended Budget are shown in
Attachment C.
Notable designated reserve fund changes include an increase over the 2013 Amended Budget in
the Base System year-end unrestricted fund balance, which is projected to increase $3.7 million
to $18.1 million in line with the SBP. Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is
projected to increase by $5.0 million to $21.2 million, and the capital replacement fund is
projected to increase by $5.0 million to $14.0 million. While the SBP targets called for an
increase of $3.0 million in each fund, it is proposed that the contribution be raised to $5.0
million to each fund in 2014 due to the additional dollars generated from the higher sales and use
tax forecast.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to remain essentially flat at
$23.4 million. The $3.7 million increase in the Base System’s unrestricted fund balance is offset
by a decrease of $3.3 million on the FasTracks side from the reduction in fund balance from
three months of operating expenses to two months. Both the Board-appropriated fund and the
capital replacement fund on a District-wide basis are projected to increase by $1.7 million each.
These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities
(Base System, FasTracks Projects, and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
The FasTracks Construction Reserve is budgeted to decrease $59.4 million in 2014 from the
2013 Amended Budget as a result of the accrual of DTP (Denver Transit Partners) finance
charges and the use of funds for construction purposes. FasTracks contributed capital of $49.8
million, consisting of concessionaire contributed capital and third-party betterments on the Eagle
construction project, will decrease $52.4 million due to DUS project completion in spring 2014.
The 2014 budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks contingency reserve at a
balance of $30 million.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2014 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA
farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures
and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.

Packet Pg. 31

2.B.1

Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2014 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, and an undesignated working capital fund (the remaining
unrestricted year-end fund balance) for both the Base System and FasTracks. The objective is
for the total of these three funds to equal approximately three months of operating expenses
excluding depreciation for the Base System and two months of same for FasTracks. The 2014
budget reflects continued maintenance of the FasTracks contingency reserve at a balance of $30
million. This reserve has been carried at $30 million since 2010.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2014 is projected at $69.3 million on a Districtwide basis, comprised of 1) the Board appropriated fund of $26.5 million, 2) the capital
replacement fund of $19.3 million, and 3) an undesignated working capital fund or remaining
fund balance of $23.4 million. The Base System portion of the three fund balances for 2014 is
projected to total $53.3 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:



Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
Attachments

As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2014 Recommended Budget and Fiscal
Year 2014 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/nonoperating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital
expenditures, and fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached
is the Program Capital Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget
Changes Since Posted Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary
(Attachment B), and Capital Carryforward Expenditures (Attachment C).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2014 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2014 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2014 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2013. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2013, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and maintenance
purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 13, 2013

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

November 13, 2013

Board Meeting Date: November 19, 2013

Subject:

Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate
Swap Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached modifications to the RTD Interest Rate Swap Policy.
BACKGROUND
The District’s Interest Rate Swap Policy (the “Policy”), attached, serves to direct the implementation and
management of interest rate exchange agreements (“swaps”) entered into between the District and
qualified swap counterparties. The Policy requires review by the Board at least annually.
An interest rate swap is a financial contract in which two parties agree to exchange a stream of cash
flows according to pre-arranged terms for a fixed period of time. Swaps may be utilized to produce
interest savings, to limit or hedge variable rate payments, to alter the pattern of debt service payments,
to lock in a current or future fixed borrowing rate, to create additional variable rate exposure and/or to
facilitate asset/liability management.
DISCUSSION
The District is not counterparty to any outstanding swap agreements at this time and staff is not
anticipating the need to enter a swap agreement at any point in the foreseeable future. Also, all
outstanding and currently planned debt of the District has a fixed interest rate. Should opportunities
arise in the future to utilize swaps to produce savings or present other economic benefits to the District,
staff will inform the Board in that regard.
Staff is recommending that the annual review requirement of the Policy be changed so that the Board
does not need to review the Policy on an annual basis unless the District is involved in or planning to
enter a swap agreement.
Some additional language changes are also being recommended to clarify the Policy and to reflect the
implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
The attached redline draft of the Policy reflects changes recommended by staff, most notably the
change to the policy that would only require the Board to review the Policy annually so long as the
District is involved with or planning to enter a swap agreement.

ATTACHMENTS
As noted above, please refer to the attached redline copy of the Interest Rate Swap Policy which
identifies the changes recommended by staff.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the revised Interest Rate Swap Policy. This is the recommended action.

Packet Pg. 55

2.B.2

2. Revise the Interest Rate Swap Policy and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Make no changes to the existing Interest Rate Swap Policy and adopt it in its current form.

2.B.2.a

Regional Transportation District
Interest Rate Swap Policy
I.

Introduction:
The purpose of the Interest Rate Swap Policy of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) is to establish guidelines for the use and management of interest rate swaps.
The Interest Rate Swap Policy is intended to provide general procedural direction
regarding the use, procurement and execution of interest rate swaps. The Policy is
intended to relate to various interest rate hedging techniques, including the
contractual exchange of different fixed and variable rate payment streams through
interest rate swap agreements (for purposes of this policy, the term “interest rate swap
agreements” is intended to encompass, to the extent permitted by law, interest rate
swaps, caps, collars, floors, rate hedges for future issuances, basis swaps, and certain
other financial products used by municipal entities when accessing the capital
markets) and is not intended to relate to other derivative products that RTD may
consider.

II.

Scope and Authority:
This Interest Rate Swap Policy shall govern the RTD’s use and management of all
interest rate swaps. While adherence to this Policy is required in applicable
circumstances, the RTD recognizes that changes in the capital markets, District
programs and other unforeseen circumstances may from time to time produce
situations that are not covered by the Policy and will require modifications or
exceptions to achieve policy goals. In these cases, management flexibility is
appropriate provided specific authorization from the Board is obtained.
The Interest Rate Swap Policy shall be reviewed and updated at least annually and
presented to the Board of Directors for approval so long as the District is involved in
or planning to enter an interest rate swap agreement. Day-to-day responsibility for
management of interest rate swaps shall fall within the responsibilities of the Chief
Financial Officer.
The District shall be authorized to enter into interest rate swap transactions only with
qualified swap counterparties. The Chief Financial Officer, in consultation with the
District’s bond counsel and financial advisor, shall have authority to select the
counterparties, so long as the criteria set forth in the Interest Rate Swap Policy are
met.

III.

Approach and Objectives:
Interest rate swaps are appropriate interest rate management tools that can help RTD
meet important financial objectives. Properly used, these instruments can increase
RTD’s financial flexibility, modify interest rate exposure, provide opportunities for

Packet Pg. 57

Attachment: Interest Rate Swap Policy-revised 2013 REDLINE (1769 : Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate Swap Policy)

2.B.2.a

interest rate savings, hedge or mitigate interest rate risk for future financings and help
RTD manage its balance sheet through better matching of assets and liabilities. Swaps
should be integrated into RTD’s overall debt program and should not be used for
speculation.
Swaps are appropriate to use when they achieve a specific objective consistent with
RTD’s overall financial strategies. They may be used, for example, to lock in a
current or future market fixed rate or create additional variable rate exposure. They
may also be used to produce interest rate savings, to limit or hedge variable rate
exposure, to alter the pattern of debt service payments or for asset/liability matching
purposes.
IV.

Conditions for Use of Interest Rate Swaps:
A. General Usage:
In connection with the use of any interest rate swap agreement, the RTD’s Board of
Directors shall make a finding that the authorized interest rate exchange agreement(s)
will be used to alter, hedge or reduce interest rate risk and/or alter the cost of
borrowing in a beneficial manner, and when used in combination with to-be-issued,
new or outstanding bonds, will enhance the relationship between risk and return or to
achieve other policy objectives of the District.
B. Maximum Notional Amount:
The RTD will limit the total notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps based
on criteria set forth in this Interest Rate Swap Policy regarding the proper
management of risks, calculation of termination exposure, and development of a
contingency plan. The total “net notional amount” of all swaps related to an
individual bond issue should not exceed the outstanding or expected par amount of
the related bonds. For purposes of calculating the net notional amount, consideration
shall be given to multiple swaps on the same series of bonds which have a layering,
offsetting, or mitigating effect.
C. Maximum Maturity:
RTD shall determine the appropriate term for an interest rate swap agreement on a
case-by-case basis. In connection with the issuance or carrying of bonds, the term of
the swap agreement between RTD and a qualified swap counterparty shall not extend
beyond the final maturity date of related bonds.
D. Liquidity Considerations:
RTD shall consider the impact of any variable rate bonds issued in combination with
an interest rate swap on the availability and cost of liquidity support for other variable
rate programs. The RTD recognizes that there may be at any point in time a limited

2

Packet Pg. 58

Attachment: Interest Rate Swap Policy-revised 2013 REDLINE (1769 : Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate Swap Policy)

2.B.2.a

supply of letter of credit or liquidity facility support for RTD variable rate bonds, and
the usage of liquidity support in connection with an interest rate swap may result in
higher overall costs for the District.
E. Call Option Value Considerations:
When considering the relative advantage of an interest rate swap to fixed rate bonds,
the RTD will consider the value of the call option on fixed rate bonds. The value
derived from the ability to call bonds at a future date may be foregone when using a
swap for the remaining term of the bonds unless the swap is customized to
incorporate a cancellation option on behalf of the RTD. While fixed rate RTD bonds
are typically structured with a call provision at a certain time, after which the bonds
may be refunded, this opportunity may be lost through the utilization of a long-dated
swap, impairing the District’s ability to reap economic savings.
V.

Interest Rate Swap Features:
A. Interest Rate Swap Agreement:
RTD will use terms and conditions as set forth in the International Swap and
Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) Master Agreement or such other swap
documentation which may be appropriate. The swap agreement between RTD and
each swap counterparty shall include payment, term, security, collateral, default,
remedy, termination, and other terms, conditions, provisions and safeguards as the
RTD, in consultation with its legal counsel, and financial advisor deems necessary or
desirable.
Subject to the provisions contained herein, the terms of any RTD swap agreement
shall use the following guidelines:
1.
2.
3.

4.

5.

RTD’s downgrade provisions triggering termination shall in no event be
worse than those affecting the counterparty.
Governing law for swaps will be New York.
The specified indebtedness related to credit events in any swap agreement
should be narrowly defined and refer only to indebtedness of the RTD that
could have a materially adverse affect on RTD’s ability to perform its
obligations under the swap.
Collateral thresholds for the swap provider should be set on a sliding scale
reflective of credit ratings of the swap provider or guarantor and the RTD.
Collateral posted by RTD should be held by an independent third party.
Eligible collateral should generally be limited to U.S. Treasury obligations
and other obligations the principal and interest of which are backed by the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Eligible collateral shall be
limited to those investment obligations which are legal investments for
RTD.

Packet Pg. 59

6.

Attachment: Interest Rate Swap Policy-revised 2013 REDLINE (1769 : Annual Report to the Board - Interest Rate Swap Policy)

2.B.2.a

Termination value should be set by a “market quotation” methodology,
unless RTD deems an alternate appropriate.

B. Interest Rate Swap Counterparties:
1.

Credit Criteria:
RTD shall make its best efforts to work with qualified swap counterparties
only if, at the time the transaction is entered into: (a) the long-term debt
obligations of the counterparty or its credit support provider or guarantor
are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by one or more
nationally recognized securities rating agencies which regularly rate such
obligations; or (b) the obligations under the agreement of the counterparty
are either (i) guaranteed by a party whose long-term debt obligations are
rated in one of the two highest rating categories by one or more nationally
recognized securities rating agencies which regularly rate such
obligations; or (ii) collateralized by obligations which are legal
investments for the RTD and which maintain a market value of not less
than one hundred percent of the principal amount upon which the
exchange of interest rates is based. The nationally recognized rating
agencies are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation
and Fitch Ratings.
In addition, qualified swap counterparties must have a demonstrated
record of successfully executing swap transactions as well as creating and
implementing innovative ideas in the swap market.

C. Counterparty Termination Exposure:
In order to diversify RTD’s counterparty credit risk, and to limit its credit
exposure to any one counterparty, the RTD will compute the “Maximum Net
Termination Exposure” prior to executing a swap with any counterparty. No
counterparty may exceed the Maximum Net Termination Exposure outlined
below.
“Maximum Net Termination Exposure” is the aggregate termination payment
exposure, net of the value of collateral posted or that would be posted in
accordance with the swap agreement with such counterparty, for all existing and
projected swap transactions with an individual counterparty. For purposes of this
calculation, the aggregate termination payment is equal to the expected worst-case
net termination amount for the existing transactions and the proposed transaction
over the life of all existing and proposed transactions. The expected worst-case
termination payment shall be calculated assuming interest rates, as measured by
the appropriate swap market yield curve, increase (or decrease) by two standard
deviations from the on-market forward swap rate over the term of the swap
portfolio with the counterparty.

D. Collateral Requirements:
As part of any swap agreement, the RTD may, based upon credit ratings of the
counterparty, require collateralization or other forms of credit enhancement to
secure any or all swap payment obligations. As appropriate, RTD, in consultation
with its counsel and financial advisor, may require collateral or other credit
enhancement to be posted by any swap counterparty if the long-term unsecured
credit rating of the counterparty or parent falls below the A category by any one
of the organizations rating agencies that regularly rate such counterparties.
Additional collateral for further decreases in credit ratings of each counterparty
shall be posted by each counterparty in accordance with the provisions contained
in the collateral support agreement to each counterparty with the District.
Threshold collateral amounts shall be determined by the RTD on a case-by-case
basis. The RTD will determine the reasonable threshold limits for the initial
deposit and for increments of collateral posting thereafter. Collateral shall be
deposited with a third party custodian, or as mutually agreed upon by the RTD
and the counterparty. A list of acceptable securities that may be posted as
collateral and the valuation of such collateral will be determined and mutually
agreed upon during the negotiation of the swap agreement with each swap
counterparty. The market value of the collateral shall be determined on a daily
basis.
E. Swap Insurance
If, after a cost/benefit analysis, it is determined that it would be beneficial to
insure the interest rate swap, swap insurance will be pursued.
F. Security and Source of Repayment:
The District will generally use the same security and source of repayment
(pledged revenues) for the interest rate swap as is used for the related bonds issue
unless circumstances exist which require the use of an alternate security or
repayment source .

2.B.2.a

G. Prohibited Interest Rate Swap Features:
The RTD will not use interest rate swaps that are: (i) speculative or create
extraordinary leverage or risk, (ii) lack adequate liquidity to terminate without
incurring an extraordinary bid/ask spread, (iii) provide insufficient price
transparency to allow reasonable valuation, or (iv) are used as investments.
VI.

Evaluation and Management of Interest Rate Swap Risks:
Prior to the execution of any swap transaction, the District’s Chief Financial Officer,
financial advisor and bond counsel shall evaluate the proposed transaction and report
the findings to the RTD Board. Such a review shall include the identification of the
proposed benefit and potential risks. As part of this evaluation, the RTD shall
compute the Maximum Net Termination Exposure to the proposed swap
counterparty.
A. Evaluation Methodology:
RTD will review the following areas of potential risk for new and existing interest
rate swaps:
Type of Risk

Description

Evaluation Methodology

Basis Risk

The mismatch between actual
variable rate debt service and
variable rate indices used to
determine swap payments.
The risk created by potential tax
events that could negatively
affect swap payments.

The RTD will review historical
trading differentials between the
variable rate bonds and the index.

Tax Risk

Counterparty Risk

The risk that the counterparty
fails to make required payments.

Termination Risk

The risk that the transaction is
terminated in a market dictating
termination payment by the
RTD.

Rollover Risk

The mismatch of the maturity of
the swap and the maturity of the
underlying bonds.

Liquidity Risk

The inability to continue or
renew a liquidity facility or
Letter of Credit.

The RTD will review the tax
events
in
proposed
swap
agreements. It will also evaluate
the impact of potential changes in
tax law on LIBOR indexed swaps
and the expected savings from
retaining tax risk.
The
RTD
will
monitor
counterparty ratings, exposure
levels, ratings thresholds and
collateralization requirements.
RTD will periodically compute its
termination exposure for all
existing and proposed swaps at
market value and under a worstcase scenario.
RTD will determine its capacity to
issue variable rate bonds that may
be outstanding after the maturity
of the swap.
RTD will evaluate the expected
availability of liquidity support
for swapped and unhedged
variable rate debt.

Annual Report to the Board:
Staff will evaluate the risks associated with outstanding interest rate
swaps at least annually and provide a written evaluation to the Board
of Directors. This evaluation will include the following information:
i.

iv.

v.

vi.
vii.

A description of all outstanding interest rate swaps, including
related bond series, types of swaps, rates paid and received by
RTD, existing notional amount, average life and remaining
term of each swap agreement and the current termination value
of outstanding swaps.
Separately for each swap, the actual debt service requirements
versus the projected debt service on the swap transaction. For
any swap used as part of a refunding, the actual cumulative
savings versus the projected savings at the time the swap was
executed.
The credit rating of each swap counterparty, parent, guarantor
and credit enhancer insuring the swap payments, if any.
Actual collateral posting by swap counterparty or RTD, if any,
per swap agreement and in total by swap counterparty and
RTD.
Information concerning any material event involving
outstanding swap agreements, including a default by a swap
counterparty, counterparty downgrade or termination.
An updated contingency plan to replace, or fund a termination
payment in the event an outstanding swap is terminated.
The status of any liquidity support used in connection with
variable rate bonds related to interest rate swaps, including the
remaining term and current fee.

RTD shall review the Interest Rate Swap Policy with the Board at least
annually so long as RTD is involved in or planning to enter an interest
rate swap agreement.
2.

Contingency Plan:
The RTD shall compute the termination exposure of each of its
swaps and its total swap termination payment exposure at least
annually and prepare a contingency plan to either replace the swaps
or fund the termination payments, if any, in the event one or more
outstanding swaps are terminated. The RTD shall assess its ability to
obtain replacement swaps and identify revenue sources to fund
potential termination payments.

2.B.2.a

C. Terminating Interest Rate Swaps
1.

Optional Termination:
RTD may structure interest rate swaps to include optional
termination, which would allow the District to terminate a swap prior
to its maturity if it is determined that it is financially advantageous to
do so. The District may also purchase cancellation options which
would allow cancellation of the swap on a specified date or dates
without having to make a termination payment.

2.

Mandatory Termination:
In the event a swap is terminated as a result of a termination event
such as a default or credit downgrade of either counterparty, the
RTD will evaluate whether it is financially advantageous to obtain a
replacement swap or, depending on market value, make or receive a
termination payment.
In the event RTD makes a swap termination payment, the RTD shall
attempt to follow the process identified in its swap contingency plan.
The RTD shall also evaluate the economic costs and benefits of
incorporating a provision into the swap agreement that will allow the
RTD to make termination payments over time.

VII.

Procurement:
RTD will not have a fixed guideline with respect to swap procurement. Rather, it will
assess the benefits of competitively bidding financial products that are nonproprietary or generally available in the marketplace. On a product-by-product basis,
RTD may choose to negotiate the procurement of financial instruments. Qualified
swap counterparties are financial institutions meeting the credit criteria outlined in
this Policy. Counterparties may be institutions not included in RTD’s underwriting
pool.
In determining whether a swap procurement will be negotiated or competitive, RTD
staff shall consider, among other things, the then existing market for the type of
transaction expected to be entered into, counterparty diversification, the availability
of counterparties for the type of transaction expected to be entered into, the size of the
transaction, the costs and expenses associated with a negotiated versus a competitive
undertaking, and the proprietary nature of the proposed transaction or application
thereof and the service provided by the counterparty in developing an idea or strategy
that benefits the RTD. In the event that the transaction is to be negotiated or
competetitive, the RTD staff shall retain the services of an independent,

2.B.2.a

knowledgeable individual or firm to advise the Authority District as to the fairness of
the pricing of the transaction.
In the event it is determined that the payment agreement will be competitively bid,
the RTD staff reserves the right to limit the (a) number of qualified counterparties that
may participate in a single swap agreement bid and (b) notional amount of swap
agreements with any counterparty, either for any individual swap or in the aggregate.
VIII.

Disclosure and Financial Reporting:
RTD will take steps to ensure that there is full and complete disclosure of all interest
rate swaps to the RTD Board of Directors, rating agencies and in disclosure
documents. Disclosure in marketing documents shall provide a clear summary of the
special risks involved with swaps and any potential exposure to interest rate volatility
or unusually large and rapid changes in market value. With respect to its financial
statements, the RTD will adhere to the guidelines for the financial reporting of
interest rate swaps as set forth by the Government Accounting Standards Board.

Regulatory Compliance
Pursuant to the authority of Section 731 of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank”), which includes
amendments to Section 4s(h) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”) regarding
over-the-counter derivative instruments, regulations were published by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission that define business conduct between swap
dealers or major swap participants and their counterparties. In accordance with
Section 4s(h) of the CEA, as amended by Dodd-Frank, RTD staff shall designate its
Swap Advisor as the Designated Evaluation Agent that is capable of independently
evaluating any proposed Swaps and associated investment risks on behalf of RTD.

Glossary of Terms
Asset/Liability Matching: Matching the term and amount of assets and liabilities in
order to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates.
Bid/Ask Spread: The difference between the bid price (at which a market maker is
willing to buy) and the ask price (at which a market maker is willing to sell).
Call Option: The right to buy an underlying asset (e.g. a municipal bond) after a
certain date at a certain price. A call option is frequently embedded in a municipal
bond, giving the issuer the right to buy, or redeem, the bonds at a certain price.
Collateral: Assets pledged to secure an obligation. The assets are potentially subject
to seizure in event of default.
Downgrade: A negative change in credit ratings.
Forward Starting Swap: Interest rate swap that starts at some time in the future. Used
to lock-in current interest rates.
Hedge: A transaction that reduces the interest rate risk of an underlying security.
Interest Rate Exchange Agreement: An agreement detailing the contractual exchange
of interest payment streams between counterparties. Often the exchange of a fixed
and a floating interest rate between two parties. Also called an interest rate swap.
Interest Rate Swap: An agreement detailing the contractual exchange of interest
payment streams between counterparties. Often the exchange of a fixed and a floating
interest rate between two parties. Also called an interest rate exchange agreement.
Liquidity Support: An agreement by a bank to make payment on a variable rate
security to assure investors that the security can be sold.
LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate. Often used as an index to compute the
variable rate paid on an interest rate swap.
Maximum Net Termination Exposure: The aggregate termination payment for all
existing and projected swap transactions that would be paid by an individual
counterparty. For purposes of this calculation, the aggregate termination payment is
equal to: (i) the termination payment based on the market value of all existing swaps
as of the first day of the month prior to the execution of any proposed transaction,
plus (ii) the expected worst-case termination payment of the proposed transaction.
The expected worst-case termination payment shall be calculated assuming interest
rates, as measured by the appropriate index (typically the Bond Buyer Revenue Bond
Index or Bond Market Association), increase (or decrease) by two standard deviations
from the sample mean over a period of time corresponding to the term of the swap.

Subject:

2014 Internal Audit Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2014.
BACKGROUND
The annual internal audit plan has historically been approved by the General Manager. As a result of the
recent State of Colorado examination, it was agreed that the Board of Directors would also approve the
internal audit plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached plan includes the calculated number of days available for auditing, as well as the audit
plan, the title of the auditor assigned, and an estimate of the days allocated for each audit. A total of
twenty (20) audits are planned. Due to budget constraints, there are no outside audits scheduled for
this year.
The plan is based on estimates of the time required to complete the audits. As in past years, it utilizes
every available business day. If other audits arise during the year, we will request the input of the Board
as to which audits are to be eliminated to accommodate the added audit/audits.

3. Ensure contract compliance by RTD and the contractor.
METHODOLOGY
The methodology used to accomplish the objectives of the audit included but were not limited to
the following:
1. Obtained and reviewed the contract file, the contract, the Standard Procurement Manual
and all relevant invoices.
2. Checked that the process used for determination of the contractor agreed with the
requirements of the Standard Procurement Manual and was justified.
3. Vouched invoices for accuracy and approval.
CONCLUSION
The contract was well managed. The selection of the contractor was properly justified. The
contract was valid, properly authorized and approved. Payment was only made on invoice
charges that were valid, reasonable, accurate and according to terms of the contract. There
was compliance by both RTD and the contractor. The final payment was not processed at the
time of the audit.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 13-08-13

2.C.1.a

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has entered into agreements with various Inter-Governmental Agencies (IGA) and other
entities, to share the costs of maintaining common areas at various light rail and bus stations,
and park-n-Ride locations. Most locations provide an annual budget for anticipated Common
Area Maintenance (CAM) costs, allocating a calculated percentage to RTD, who will pay onetwelfth of that estimate every month. Agencies also provide a ‘Budget vs Actual’ reconciliation
after year-end to determine if participants, including RTD, owe any additional funds, or are due
a refund if actual costs are less than anticipated.
In the standard shared cost agreement, RTD has the right to request additional supporting
documents or to review the records of the IGA to ensure charges are in accordance with the
signed agreement.
SCOPE
We selected three CAM Charge agreements for review and testing to ensure shared charges
between RTD and the controlling entity were adequately reviewed, verified, and approved for
payment. We also examined Budget vs. Actual Expense Reconciliations to verify that adequate
support and variance explanations were provided by the IGA.
CONCLUSION
Annual Year-End Expense Reconciliations with variance explanations were not consistently
prepared by the IGA’s within reasonable time limits. Our review also did not find evidence that
annual ‘shared expense’ budgets were compared to the current year’s actual YTD and full-year
annualized expense, with variances explained before the next year’s budget was approved by
RTD management.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to normal Audit follow-up
review in 2014.

2014 Ridership Goal Model

BACKGROUND
Ridership goals for RTD have historically been budgeted and established for performance measure
benchmarking for the following year to change as a function of fare increases and service levels. In
2013, a ridership goal of 101.9 million or a 2.8% increase over 2012 was projected. The 2.8%
projected increase resulted primarily from the opening of the West Line. At the June General Manager
Oversight and Review Committee meeting, a Board member requested that staff research the possibility
of developing a ridership goal. A question arose as to how to incorporate a ridership goal in 2014
projected under a new modeling technique. That question was not answered during that meeting,
however, the General Manager directed staff to research this request.

DISCUSSION
A group of staff members from the finance and planning departments, including those with statistical
modeling expertise were assembled to develop a proposed ridership goal model to present to the Board.
In developing a ridership model, staff researched several variables which might affect ridership for the
purpose of identifying those variables with the closest correlation to changes in ridership based on
historical data. Variables for which RTD has control and does not have control were considered with the
objective of using at least two variables in the model. Examples of variables considered included hours
of service, employment, unemployment rate, gas prices, population and average fares paid.
Staff also considered several statistical modeling techniques to determine which type of model would
provide the most accurate estimate based on the data time series, number of variables, etc. In addition,
staff also researched ridership modeling best practices from other transit agencies.
The statistical model that best explains historical changes in RTD ridership uses a combination of hours
of service, employment and gas prices. This modeled annual ridership tracks the observed annual
ridership fairly closely back to 1993, making the model suitable for short-term ridership forecasting.
This model forecasts the following ridership increases:
From 2012 to 2013: 1.3% (the actual increase through September 2013 is 1.7%)
From 2013 to 2014: 0.6%
Attached is a white paper summarizing the model development, predictor variable selection, observed
and forecast predictor variable data, forecast ridership, and some sensitivity analysis. The forecast
percent increases are lower than 2.8% because, although RTD bus and train hours and employment are
expected to increase, real gas prices (adjusted for forecast inflation) are expected to decrease. Staff is
seeking Board direction on how to proceed with this new ridership methodology and a potentially new
ridership goal.

This white paper summarizes short-term ridership forecasting model development,
predictor variable selection, observed and forecast predictor variable data, forecast
ridership, and some sensitivity analysis.
Model Development
RTD contacted the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA) and
the consulting firm Cambridge Systematics to obtain information on the methodology used
to develop short – term ridership forecasts. Those entities had conducted a review of peer
transit agencies including:
•

Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)

•

King County Metro (Seattle)

•

Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA – New York City)

•

Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA – Philadelphia)

A total of 12 transit agencies were contacted, but information was not provided from
some agencies, and many agencies do not develop short-term ridership forecasts. A
variety of forecasting methods are used, but complex econometric models, like the ones
currently used by WMATA, are not commonly used in the transit agencies surveyed.
Complex econometric models are necessary at WMATA because of its need to forecast
monthly ridership segmented by bus and rail and for weekdays and weekends. RTD
desires to forecast annual system ridership. It was decided that a relatively simple linear
regression model would suffice for RTD given its needs and resource constraints. This
model is about as sophisticated as models used by CTA and King County Metro, and more
sophisticated than models used by MTA and SEPTA.
In developing a ridership model, staff researched several variables which might affect
ridership for the purpose of identifying those variables with the closest correlation to
changes in ridership based on historical data. Variables for which RTD has control and
does not have control were considered with the objective of using at least two variables in
the model. Examples of variables considered included hours of service, employment,
unemployment rate, gasoline price, and average fare paid.
Figures 1-6 are plots of RTD annual ridership, RTD vehicle hours, Denver metro area
employment, real gasoline price, 1 minus the Denver metro unemployment rate, and RTD
average fares paid.

Comparisons of Figures 2, 3, and 4 with Figure 1 clearly show that vehicle hours,
employment, and gas price all strongly track with ridership. A comparison of Figure 5 with
Figure 1 shows that 1 minus the unemployment rate does not track well with ridership.
Finally, a comparison of Figure 6 with Figure 1 shows that average fare paid tracks with
ridership. However, this is counter-intuitive. One would expect that, all else being equal,
higher fares paid would result in lower ridership rather than higher ridership.
Data sources for these variables are as follows:


RTD ridership, vehicle hours, and average fare paid: RTD Finance and Service

State

Another important consideration for the choice of predictor variables is the ability to obtain
forecasts of those predictor variables. For example, it would be difficult to predict future
average fare paid. RTD was able to provide forecasts of vehicle hours. The State
Demography Office was able to provide forecasts of employment and the unemployment
rate. The Energy Information Administration was able to provide forecasts of national
gasoline prices. These forecasts were adjusted to lower levels associated with the Rocky
Mountain region based on observed data. Moody’s was able to provide CPI forecasts.
Based on the observations from the above figures and the availability of forecast data, it
was decided to test regression models using the following predictor variables:




Annual vehicle hours
Denver metro area employment
Annual average real fuel price

RTD staff tested regression models with all possible combinations of these three variables.
Models were evaluated based on numerous statistics including:






Adjusted R2
Standard error of estimate
Durbin-Watson statistic
t statistics
Variance inflation factor (VIF)

A summary of all tested regression models, including values of all statistics, is presented in
the Appendix.
The statistical model that best explains historical changes in RTD ridership uses a
combination of vehicle hours, employment, and gasoline price. The resulting model is
expressed as an equation as follows:
Ridership = 10,614,906 + (5.677 * VehicleHours) + (26.899 * Employment) +
(5,943,590 * RealFuelPrice)
This modeled annual ridership tracks the observed annual ridership fairly closely back to
1993, making the model suitable for short-term ridership forecasting. Figure 7 shows this
relationship.

Forecast Ridership
Using the model results in the following forecast annual ridership for 2013 and 2014:
2013: 100,747,593
2014: 101,351,845
This model forecasts the following ridership increases:



From 2012 to 2013: 1.3%
From 2013 to 2014: 0.6%

The forecast percent increases are lower than the 2.8% increase expected in 2013
because, although RTD bus and train hours and employment are expected to increase, real
gasoline prices (nominal prices adjusted for forecast inflation) are expected to decrease.
RTD staff conducted sensitivity analyses of the forecasts.
Specifically, “what if”
forecasts were made where two of the three predictor variables were held constant at
2012 levels to test the importance of each predictor variable in isolation.
If only annual vehicle hours change, and Denver metro area employment and annual
average real fuel price are held constant, forecast ridership increases are 0.5% and 0.4%
from 2012 to 2013 and 2013 to 2014, respectively. The elasticity of ridership relative to
vehicle hours is about 0.2. This means that every 10% change in vehicle hours results in
a change of 2% in ridership.

Short-term Ridership Forecasting Model

If only annual average real fuel price changes, and annual vehicle hours and Denver metro
area employment held constant, forecast ridership decreases are -0.5% and -0.7% from
2012 to 2013 and 2013 to 2014, respectively. The elasticity of ridership relative to fuel
price is about 0.2. This means that every 10% change in fuel price results in a change of
2% in ridership.
Conclusion
RTD staff has developed a regression model to forecast short-term annual ridership. This
model could be used in setting a ridership change goal for the agency and for short-term
budgeting. It is recommended that the model be revisited annually.

Third Quarter 2013 Investment Report

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the third quarter of 2013 attached.
The U.S. economy expanded at a rate of 2.8% percent during the third quarter of 2013. The national
unemployment rate remains at 7.3% and general inflationary pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy and leave the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the
third quarter noting that this level will continue to “be appropriate at least as long as unemployment
remains above 6.5% and inflation expectations continue to be well anchored”.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

3rd Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

0.031%
0.018%

0.095%
0.057%

0.092%
0.130%

0.208%
0.244%

Enhanced Cash Tier:
RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the third quarter of 2013 was 0.70% which
would produce annualized earnings of $1.698 million. The current return for the month of September
was 0.31%.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: November 13, 2013

From:

Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager, Civil Rights
Division

GM

Date:

November 13, 2013

Board Meeting Date: November 19, 2013

Subject:

Recommendation for Adoption of ADA Program
Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Americans with
Disabilities Act (“ADA”) Program Plan. By this action, the Board of Directors affirms that it is a priority of
RTD to provide equal access enterprise-wide for people with disabilities in accordance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. The purpose of the ADA Program Plan is to
provide guidance, policies, procedures, and monitoring to further this policy direction.
BACKGROUND
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794, was the precursor to the ADA and
protects qualified individuals from discrimination based upon a disability. Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act applies to entities that receive federal assistance including RTD.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12601 et seq., was passed in 1990, and
amended in 2008 pursuant to the ADA Amendments Act (PL110-325). The sections of the ADA
applicable to RTD are the first two titles. Title I applies to employment practices and Title II applies to
public services. Part B of Title II, 42 U.S.C. § 12141 et seq. specifically covers public transportation
provided by public entities. This law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, requires the
provision of paratransit service, and sets standards for transportation facilities and vehicles.
The Department of Justice regulates and enforces Section 504 and the ADA, except that the
Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”) administer the
mass transportation provisions of Section 504 and the ADA, and DOT has issued implementing
regulations at 49 C.F.R. Parts 27, 37 and 38.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s Senior Leadership Team believes that providing equal access to its programs and services for the
people with disabilities community is an important priority for RTD. Because of the diverse ways in
which RTD is affected by and impacts people with disabilities community, RTD needs to designate a
single individual who is responsible for directing a plan to achieve the policy directive. The Senior
Manager, Civil Rights, has sufficient visibility within RTD and the relevant resources to effectively
develop the ADA program.1 Accordingly, the Senior Manager, Civil Rights, should be designated as the
RTD ADA Coordinator; in that role, the Senior Manager, Civil Rights can implement an ADA Program
Plan. The ADA Program Plan defines RTD’s policy priorities and creates a framework by which RTD
1

When the ADA was initially passed, RTD had designated the Senior Manager, Human Resources as the ADA Coordinator.
Since that time, RTD has established a Civil Rights division and created the position of Senior Manager, Civil Rights, which is a
more appropriate position to take on the duties of ADA Coordinator.

3.B.1

employees, consultants and contractors will continue to work together to provide equal access
enterprise-wide for people with disabilities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact at this time.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) Program Plan. By this action, the Board
of Directors affirms that it is a priority of RTD to provide equal access enterprise-wide for people with
disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. The
purpose of the ADA Program Plan is to provide guidance, policies, procedures, and monitoring to
further this policy direction.
2. Designate Another Individual as ADA Coordinator. The Board could designate another individual or
individuals as ADA Coordinator. This is not recommended because no other individual is as uniquely
suited to address this civil rights issue as the Sr. Manager, Civil Rights, although other members
within the organization will be responsible for implementing certain aspects of the ADA Program
Plan.
3. No Action. The Board of Directors may take no action. This is not recommended because providing
equal access to its programs and services for people with disabilities community is an important
priority for RTD, and adopting the ADA Program Plan is consistent with that priority.

EMPLOYMENT

RTD prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in regard to job application
procedures, hiring, advancement or discharge of employees, employee compensation, and
other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.
Although all RTD employees have a responsibility to maintain a workplace environment
free of unlawful discrimination and harassment, RTD’s Equal Opportunity (“EO”) Office (a
subdivision of RTD’s Civil Rights Division) is responsible for investigating and resolving
complaints of discrimination and harassment in violation of RTD’s EEO policy. Complaints
should be made to a supervisor or the EO Office. Verbal complaints must be followed up
with a complaint form. Formal complaint forms are available in the EO Office (x2190) or
on the Intranet; questions and complaints can be sent to EqualOpportunity@rtddenver.com.
RTD also intends to make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental
impairments of qualified individuals with a disability, as defined by the ADA, unless
undue hardship or a direct threat would result. Individuals seeking a reasonable
accommodation should immediately make the request known to a supervisor or the
Senior Manager, Human Resources, who is empowered to act on behalf of the ADA
Coordinator specifically for requests for reasonable accommodations for employment
purposes. In this role, the Sr. Manager, Human Resources will be responsible for
investigating and responding to the request and engaging in the interactive process. The
Sr. Manager, Human Resources may delegate this responsibility from time to time to the
Labor Relations Office for requests made by employees in the bargaining unit.
In the event that an internal complaint or request for reasonable accommodation is not
satisfied, an individual may file a charge with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Civil Rights.
The EO Office and the Senior Manager, Human Resources are responsible for developing
guidance manuals, best practices tools, and training to ensure that RTD staff, consultants
and contractors understand and implement RTD’s ADA employment objectives.

6.0

TRANSPORTATION

RTD prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision of its transportation
services. The ADA implementing regulations also require the provision of paratransit
service and set standards for transportation facilities and vehicles.
Although all RTD employees have a responsibility to provide equal access enterprise-wide
for people with disabilities, the ADA Coordinator (Sr. Manager, Civil Rights) is responsible
for investigating and resolving complaints of discrimination and harassment from
passengers and the public. Formal complaints should be made to the ADA Coordinator at
(303)299-2221 or email to ADACoordinator@rtd-denver.com. Verbal or informal
complaints must be followed up with a complaint form. RTD may forward certain
complaints from disabled passengers made to RTD’s Telephone Information Center,
through RTD’s website or email complaints system, or social media if the individual
making the complaint can be identified, to the ADA Coordinator for tracking and/or
resolution.

The Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”), through its Office of Civil Rights, may
conduct audits concerning RTD’s ADA complementary paratransit service or RTD
compliance with applicable DOT regulations or other requirements. Individuals also may
file a complaint with the FTA. See http://www.fta.dot.gov/civilrights. In the FTA
complaint process, the FTA analyzes whether the complainant's allegations include
possible ADA deficiencies, presents that information to the transit provider, and offers
assistance to correct the inadequacies within a predetermined timeframe. The FTA also
may refer the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice for enforcement.

7.0

BEST PRACTICE TOOLS

The ADA Coordinator should develop best practice tools (“Tools”) to assist RTD
employees, consultants, and contractors in implementing the ADA Program. The ADA
Coordinator should periodically revise those Tools as appropriate to improve the
effectiveness of the ADA Program.
For purposes of employment, the Tools may involve the following areas:







Recruitment, hiring and promotion
Compensation and benefits
