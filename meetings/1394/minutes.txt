Recommended Action:


Issuance of Eagle Project Request for Proposals (RFP), Increases Stipend
Agreement, Negotiation of Compensation Agreements
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors:
(a) directs staff to issue the Eagle Project Request for Proposals (RFP) on
September 30, 2009 to allow the East Corridor, Gold Line and Northwest Rail
Electrified Segment to be jointly procured and delivered under a single
concession agreement so that all corridors will open for passenger service in
2016 in accordance with the FasTracks program
(b) approves an increase in the amount of the stipend agreement from
$1,750,000 to $2,500,000 per team to provide bidder teams an increased
incentive to remain in the Eagle P3 procurement process which, in turn, will
provide a more competitive process that will maximize the value to RTD
(c) authorizes the transfer of $2,250,000 from the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve to the PPP project in the FasTracks capital budget to pay for the
increase in the stipend amount. This would advance funding included in the
FasTracks financial plan in 2010 for PPP preparation.
(d) authorizes the General Manager to negotiate and enter into a compensation
agreement with the three pre-qualified teams invited to respond to the Eagle
Project RFP (the Proposers) in an amount not to exceed $20,000,000 to be
payable in the event that RTD elects not, or is unable, to execute and
implement a concession agreement with the selected proposer through no
fault of the selected proposer. Payment only will be made to the team that is
selected by the Board for a contract award, and not to the unsuccessful
teams. As a condition of this compensation RTD would receive all of the
design work, including calculations, analyses and other supporting work that
the selected team completed as part of the proposal process. Additional
funding of $17.5 million for the compensation agreement, which equals the
difference between the stipend amount and the compensation agreement
amount for the selected proposer, is included in the FasTracks financial plan
for the Eagle project corridors in 2010, and will be budgeted at that time.
Rick Clarke reported on this item and discussed the four components. The
bids are scheduled to come back in March and two teams are planning to
move forward.
Chair McMullen asked that the word “may” be changed to “will” on the board
report.

Director Busck presented an Equity Compact Resolution that was put together
by him and Director Tayer. He apologized for the timing but indicated that
there no intention to make a motion or take action but only to generate some
thought. Equity has always been the big issue and all board members are
supportive of building the entire system. We are receiving criticism and heat
in the North Metropolitan area because of obligating all the funds. If we are
going to pay in the system and get nothing on down the road with the hope
of going to the ballot, what’s in it for us if it does fail? This shows a good
faith effort that if there are a few dollars left over that they be thrown to the
corridors.
Director Tayer indicated this is draft and asked for input by Thursday. We
need to move forward with the process of the RFP. As a regional transit
agency we need to recognize that moving forward has some potential
consequences for other areas of the region that are not projected to see the
same infrastructure investment in their corridors. This is an attempt to
recognize that and harness some commitments.
Director Martinez inquired about if we move bus services, does it have affect
on ridership and does ridership affect our funding. He wants to make sure we
craft this carefully.
It was asked if this could wait but the intent is to partner this with the action
item.
Director Bagley would like staffs input.
Marla Lien, General Council commented that her hat is off to the spirit of
where some of the board members have come. She committed to sit down
with Director Tayer this week. This is a general statement of principles. She
will work on making it refined and a statement of intent by the board and
could be changed later.
Director O’Boyle appreciates the thought here but he cannot support it. We
are united and this is a disuniting move. We are acting coward (in his opinion)
to an earlier resolution passed by an earlier board on equity. There is
considerable staff work that needs to be done. It is premature and urges
staff to look at this as well as colleagues on the board.

Director Brohl believes in order for the system to work that it needs to be
rolled out to all corridors. Everything in this compact is things we have

already discussed.
Chair McMullen mentioned that we need to keep the unity. We have to give
the voters a vague plan B.
Phil said we will rework this and have in packets by Thursday.
Director Kemp clarified that Director O’Boyle’s concerns be heard and he be
involved in rewording the compact.
Director Pulliam commented and thanked staff for a thorough job they have
done on the report.
