#### 1. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino from the Squire Patton Boggs Denver Office, introduced Patricia Doersch, Ed Newberry, and Anne Miano from the Squire Patton Boggs Washington, D.C. office.

Ed Newberry, Global Managing Partner for Squire Patton Boggs, thanked the Directors for trusting their firm for the past 15 years and for allowing them to work together turning FasTracks into reality.  He noted that throughout the years RTD has received $2.8 billion in Federal funding.  He added that the job is never done and Squire Patton Boggs is working on figuring out where the next $2 billion will come from.

Patricia Doersch, member of the firm’s Transportation, Infrastructure and Local Government Public Policy Practice, and Anne Miano, Consultant at Squire Patton Boggs, reviewed the Federal Update presentation included in the Government Relations Committee agenda packet for December 1, 2015.  The presentation included:

- RTD’s special achievements:

o        $2.8 billion received in Federal funding throughout the years

o        Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) as the 5th New Starts Project

o        Leading Voice in Public Transportation

- 2016 Openings: CU A Line, Flatiron Flyer, B Line, G Line, and R Line

- RTD’s Federal Priorities: New Starts Projects, Authorization Bill, and New Opportunities

- State of play on transportation Issues in Washington

- Recognition that the Authorization Bills is not a genuine revenue solution

- Transit programs standing in the final bill

- Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations outlook

- Squire Patton Boggs appropriations strategy

- March 2016 Washington, D.C. visit during the APTA Legislative Conference

Patricia Doersch highlighted that the SERE as the 5th New Start project is commendable.  She noted that the Federal Transit Administration’s  (FTA) Award to the SERE Environmental Assessment is one of only eleven awarded in the history of the FTA.  This, she added, speaks to RTD’s quality in project, staff, and Board leadership.

Anne Miano pointed out that RTD’s projects have changed the face of Denver over the years.  She highlighted that the Authorizations Bill would probably wrap up by Friday, December 11th.  She added that the firm has worked closely with Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, and Director Francone, who have reached out to the Colorado delegation regarding transit matters.  She added that some controversial issues may find their way to the Appropriations Bill.

Patricia Doersch noted that due to the quick turnaround, the bill will probably have a lot of errors in it and a Technical Corrections Bill would be issued.  This would be an opportunity for Squire Patton Boggs to lobby for technical improvements on behalf of RTD.  She pointed out that Congress cannot find the will to fully fund the Appropriations Bill; yet do not want to cut costs, either.  She added that she is confident, not certain, that SERE will be awarded Federal funding due to the enormous local match, which distinguishes the project from others.

Mike Dino added that as the Board looks forward to the March 2016 visit to Washington, D.C., they should also consider other sources of funding.  Some examples include the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Labor, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Economic Development Administration.  He acknowledged that RTD is a transit agency; however, so many RTD projects influence Denver in so many capacities making these other sources a possibility.

Director Lubow asked where the definition of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is at in terms of keeping flexibility and the ability for RTD to receive funding.  Patricia Doersch explained that the FAST Act provides greater flexibility for BRT as it dropped the requirement for frequent rides on the weekends.  The language that would include the US36 Project in the BRT definition was not accepted: separated right of way, traffic with toll paying vehicles, etc.  She recalled Directors Francone and Solano’s passionate case to the House and Senate staffers back in March, 2015.  The staffers opposed the position as they view the New Starts program as the one pot they still control in transit.  They believe that expanding the eligibility would water down the money.

Director Lubow wondered about the eligibility of the other proposed BRTs within RTD since most of them will not be operated on a separate lane.  Patricia Doersch explained that there are two types of BRT eligible under New Start: Traditional and Small Start.  The latter one is a corridor BRT not required to have a separate Right of Way.  This program is now under the FAST Act.  The federal contribution is $100 million and the overall project cost is $300 million.

Director Hoy was curious about how the Colorado Congressional Delegation votes in transit matters since they seem to be very supportive when meeting with the Directors.  Patricia Doersch said that the firm has addressed bill languages with some of the delegates that was concerning to RTD.  She noted that Congressman Buck and Senator Bennett called Chair Shuster from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee regarding language in the bill.  As a result, the language was removed.  Director Hoy expressed his surprise at Congressman Buck’s support.  Patricia Doersch noted that Squire Patton Boggs was asked to lobby the “un-lobbyable”.  Ed Newberry added that traditionally there is not a lot of support for transit; however, RTD has had a great deal of success because of compelling projects and the excellence of the teams behind the projects, both staff and Directors.  This combination makes it hard to not support RTD.

Anne Miano praised Marla Lien, General Counsel, for her amazing work on the SERE Environmental Assessment.  She added that she is very proud to work with her as she holds great stature in the transit community.  Patricia Doersch echoed the sentiments on Marla Lien, adding that she is well respected in Congress.

Chair Sisk said that it is never too early to talk about the March visit to Washington, D.C.  He asked Squire Patton Boggs what the key message for that visit should be.  He hopes this could be discussed during the February Government Relations committee meeting in order to be well informed by the time the March visit happens.  Chair Sisk thanked Director Francone for her work with the Colorado Congressional Delegation.  He also thanked the Directors for moving forward with the SERE project which, even though not unanimous in vote, has moved forward as a regional project with regional support.  He added that the Northwest Rail Line is next to receive funding.

Director Anderson thanked Squire Patton Boggs for all their work throughout the years and for helping RTD achieve so much for transit in the whole region.  She looks forward to making a difference during the March visit to Washington, D.C.

Chair Folska said it has been a privilege working with Squire Patton Boggs and praised their incredible professionalism and credibility.  She added that because of their efforts, RTD will open 5 lines in 2016 and will hopefully open the Northwest Rail Line by 2020.  She agreed with Chair Sisk in the importance of having a message; however, she added that the secret sauce over the past 15 years has been building relationships with local and federal stakeholders.  She thanked Squire Patton Boggs for being a critical part of building and sustaining those relationships.  She thanked them for bringing former Secretary of Transportation Slater to meet with the Board in February of 2015.  His story was very inspirational and RTD has benefited from his legacy in the Department of Transportation.

Committee Chair Folska also thanked CRL Associates and Brandeberry~McKenna, RTD’s local and state lobbyists, for their work in 2015.

Committee Chair Folska reminded the Directors of the January 28, 2016 event for State Legislators and Board Members at Denver Union Station to continue building relationships and dialogue.

Committee Chair Folska thanked Chair Sisk for trusting her to chair the Government Relations Committee through 2015.  She thanked Squire Patton Boggs and Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, for their work.  She noted that without their efforts RTD would not have been awarded Federal funding.
