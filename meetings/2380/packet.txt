RTD’s Federal Priorities
• New Starts Projects:
• Securing full funding for the Eagle P3 and the Southeast Rail Extension
projects in the FY 2016 omnibus appropriations bill
• Ensuring Southeast Rail Extension project can use STP funds – an
essential funding component from our local project partners
• Authorization Bill:
• Robust funding levels for transit
• Flexibility in BRT definitions
• Next Steps: maximizing funding and policy opportunities as US DOT
implements new authorization legislation via guidance and rulemakings
• New Opportunities:
• Building new/nontraditional partnerships and coalitions

What is the state of play on transportation
issues in Washington?
• Authorization (Programs and Policy) Bill:
• Reauthorizing surface transportation programs for the next several
years
• Advanced due to strong Congressional leadership; “Big Four

Agreement” in the House
• Long term revenue solution for transit and highway programs funded

from the Highway Trust Fund?
• Fiscal Year 2016 Appropriations (Spending) Bill:
• Funding New Starts projects, TIGER program for FY 2016

A bill, but no genuine revenue solution
• House and Senate aim to get a final bill to the President’s desk before
the latest short-term extension expires on December 4.
• No long-term revenue solution – gas tax, VMT tax, or repatriated
revenues – to close the $15 billion annual gap between transportation
spending levels and gas tax revenues.
• Gas tax increase not politically viable option for either party.
• Instead, another General Fund transfer to the Highway Trust Fund,

offset with spending cuts and revenue increases for programs
throughout the Federal budget. Some offsets are controversial.

How will transit programs fare in the final bill?
• Transit’s place in the Highway Trust Fund? Secure!
• Devolution? Dead – for now.
• Transit’s share of total Highway Trust Fund revenues?
• Overall funding levels for transit programs?
• Major changes to federal transit programs:
• Discretionary bus program is back
• Flexibility in BRT eligibility?

FY 2016 Appropriations Outlook
• Spending impasse resolved by the 2-year budget deal reached between
Congress and the President in October, increasing FY 2016 spending by $25
billion, spread across all non-defense programs.
• For transportation, the House and Senate bills are far apart, because
Senate bill includes post-budget deal spending increase:
• $71.6 billion in House
• $72.9 billion in Senate
• Differences between the bills also include large gap between House
($100m) and Senate ($600m) TIGER funding levels.
• Deadline: Current stop-gap spending bill expires December 11, so no time
to move 12 separate spending bills.
• Another Omnibus: House and Senate Appropriations Committees
negotiating an omnibus bill to fund all government programs and agencies
for the remainder of the fiscal year.

What does this mean for New Starts funding?
• RTD’s New Starts request:
• $167 million for Eagle P3 FFGA
• $92 million for new FFGA for Southeast Rail Extension
• President’s FY 2016 budget:
• $165 million for Eagle P3 FFGA
• $92 million for new FFGA for Southeast Rail Extension
• House and Senate transportation appropriations bills:
• Fully fund ongoing FFGAs, including the Eagle P3 project, but
• Significantly underfund the category of this year’s new FFGAs, which
includes the Southeast Rail Extension project.

Our Appropriations Strategy
• Eagle P3 FFGA will be fully funded this year (FY 2016)
• New FFGA for Southeast Rail Extension:
• We have been pushing both House and Senate appropriators to increase
funding for this new-projects category and give priority within the
category to the SERE – the only “one-and-done project” in the group.
• The Federal share of the SERE can be fully funded in a single year.
• Fiscally prudent choice given limited resources: Congress need not
start a funding commitment it cannot finish.
• Significant funding over-match by locals
• Strong project support by Mayor, local businesses, major employers
• Revised Senate bill introduced in November now includes $311 million
more for New Starts; FTA anticipates signing FFGA for SERE next April.
