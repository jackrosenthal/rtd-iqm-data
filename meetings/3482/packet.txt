BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2022 Safety Performance Review

June 7, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer
Dan McClain, Chief Safety Officer, Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
At RTD, the safety of customers and employees is paramount; work is constantly underway to create a
safe transit environment. As the recipient of federal funds for transit operations, RTD is subject to
federal rules and regulations regarding system safety. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) require transit agencies to develop safety management systems
describing their approach to safety and compliance with federal safety rules and regulations. The FRA
governs commuter rail and the FTA governs light rail. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
(FMCSA) governs bus.
FRA
The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 directed the FRA to promulgate new safety regulations. Those
regulations are governed by the FRA’s Office of Railroad Safety. The Office of Railroad Safety has nine
Safety Management Teams throughout the country that serve as liaisons between the FRA and senior
leadership of railroad operators. RTD is assigned to Safety Management Team 7: Commuter West.
Additionally, the FRA requires agencies to have a System Safety Program Plan (SSPP) focused on
reducing railroad accidents, incidents, injuries and fatalities.
The FRA regulations distinguish between reportable and recordable accidents or incidents. Reporting
requirements under the SSPP fall under three categories:
•
•

•

Highway rail grade crossing incident: Any impact between on-track equipment and highway user
at a highway rail-grade crossing
Train accident: Any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involving
operation of rail on-track equipment that results in reportable damages greater than the reporting
threshold, which is $11,500 for 2023
Casualties: Any death of a railroad employee or injury, occupational illness of a railroad employee
not associated with train accidents or highway rail grade incidents

Packet Pg. 3

1.E.1

Recordable events are memorialized at the agency level. They are defined as a train accident or incident
not meeting the reporting threshold or employee injury not involving lost time or medical treatment.
FTA
While the FTA retains the regulatory authority for bus and light rail, it has delegated its responsibilities as
the State Safety Oversight Agency to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). In that role, the
CPUC governs the agency’s required Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP). The PTASP
must include processes and procedures to implement Safety Management Systems (SMS). SMS is a
comprehensive, collaborative approach that brings together management and labor to control risk and to
detect and correct safety problems. The SMS is informed by safety performance goals set against
realistic, data-driven safety performance indictors and targets.
DISCUSSION
Regarding 2022 safety data:
On-the-Job Injuries
On-the-job injuries are tracked for the entire agency and are on the rise. Total cases per 100
employees increased to 19.55 in 2022, which is an eight percent increase over 2021. Of those
injuries, 41% led to lost time. The majority of injuries are attributable to slips, trips, falls and
strains.
Commuter Rail
During calendar year 2022, for the entirety of the commuter rail system, there were 44 total
accidents and incidents; seven were reportable accidents and 37 were recordable incidents.
The Commuter Rail team also tracks rule violations and station overruns. An example of a rule
violation would be an employee not wearing the required personal protective equipment while in
the right of way. A station overrun is an event in which a train engineer attempts to stop at a
station but proceeds beyond the designated stopping point. In 2002, commuter rail experienced
49 rule violations and station overruns, a 27% increase over 2021.
A near miss is an unplanned event that has the potential to cause, but not result in injury or
damage. Commuter Rail Operations experienced 49 near misses in 2022, a 27% increase over
2021.
In addition to promulgating safety reporting requirements, the FRA also frequently conducts
audits and inspections to verify the safety of the commuter rail system. In 2022, RTD
experienced four reporting defects, down from nine in 2021.
Bus
In 2022, Bus Operations experienced 1,078 bus accidents, of which 319 were preventable,
representing a 21% decrease in the total number of accidents from 2021 and a 33% increase in
preventable accidents.

Packet Pg. 4

1.E.1

Light Rail
In 2022, Light Rail Operations experienced 46 reportable events, a 35% increase over 2021.
Under CPUC regulation, the agency must report within two hours events concerning:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

A fatality at the scene or a confirmed death within 30 days of the accident
Serious injuries requiring immediate medical attention
Substantial property damage resulting from a collision involving a rail transit vehicle
An evacuation due to life safety reasons
A collision at a grade crossing resulting in a serious injury or fatality
Any derailment of a rail transit vehicle
A runaway train
A collision between a rail transit vehicle and either a second rail transit vehicle or a rail
transit non-revenue vehicle

The majority of reportable events are attributable to grade crossing collisions, which can occur
anywhere on the system where the rail and street cross at the same grade. Most grade crossing
collisions occur in the downtown loop, where street running trains, unprotected by gates, operate
along public streets and in proximity to other users, such as pedestrians, cars and cyclists.
The agency improved performance with regard to red signal violations with 28 occurring in 2022,
a 26% decrease over 2021. Also in 2022, the agency experienced three months during which
there were no red signal violations, a first for RTD.
In June 2022, the CPUC issued a 24-hour reporting requirement for nine types of hazards:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Activation failure, partial activation, or false activation of a highway-rail grade crossing
warning system
Broken rail causing impassable track
Broken messenger or contact wire, or overhead contact system wire
Train separation (train uncoupling) in revenue service
Incapacitated train operator in revenue service
Red signal violations
Vehicle door opening on wrong side, opening away from station platforms, or opening
during train movement
Near miss collision with employee, contractor, or other individual including trespassers on
the rail right of way
Any other hazard that meets a defined high risk or serious risk assessment code

Under this requirement, the agency reported an additional 54 hazards in 2022, 52 of which were
near misses.

Packet Pg. 5

1.E.1

Colorado State Patrol Audit
In December 2022, under the authority of the FMCSA within the U.S. Department of Transportation, the
Colorado State Patrol conducted a safety compliance audit of all agency programs associated with
commercial driver’s licenses. The audit included reviews of driver qualifications and records for drug and
alcohol testing, hours of service, maintenance, inspections, registrations, and payroll. The audit resulted
in minor administrative findings regarding the crash registry and driver qualification files. The auditors
provided positive feedback on the agency’s recordkeeping and maintenance and operational processes.
Managing Risk
The agency has adopted an Operational Risk Management (ORM) Framework to address safety issues.
The implementation of an ORM demonstrates a commitment to safety and unifies management systems
and other activities through a formal, continuous, data-driven, organizational-wide approach to manage
risk and assure effectiveness of risk controls.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Bus Stops and Customer Amenities

June 7, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Gabe Christie, ADA Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
There are over 9,750 bus stops across RTD’s 2,342 square-mile service area, 8,200 of which are active.
Bus stops and the amenities associated with those stops are often a customer’s first point of contact
with RTD.
The vast majority of the 8,200 active bus stops are located on rights of way owned by entities other
than RTD, including municipalities, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), private property
owners, and others. For any given bus stop, the agency is responsible for the immediate area required
for providing transit service, including the boarding and alighting area and the sign pole. Typically, the
owner of the right of way, whether RTD or another entity, adjacent to a given bus stop is responsible for
stop maintenance, including snow and trash removal, upkeep of any amenities present, and maintaining
unimpeded access to the boarding and alighting area.
As required by ordinances adopted by many of the 40 municipalities served by RTD, the property owner
adjacent to a given stop is responsible for maintenance of the public right of way bordering their
property. Many shelters and similar amenities present in the service area are owned and maintained
revenue-generating organizations, such as advertising agencies, that contract with the right-of-way
owner for use of the property.
Many bus stops and amenities were installed prior to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990 (ADA); any stop that has not been altered, improved, or relocated since the ADA’s passage
remains in compliance by default. Bus stops built or altered since 2006 are required, pursuant to the
U.S. Department of Transportation standards and Federal Transit Administration guidance, to:
•
•
•

Have a firm, stable five-foot (along the curb) by eight-foot (back from the curb) boarding area
surface, with a slope of 1:48 or less perpendicular to the curb (approximately a 2% grade)
Be connected to streets, sidewalks, and/or pedestrian paths or roadways by an accessible route
For those with shelters or similar amenities, have minimum internal shelter space to accommodate

Packet Pg. 29

1.E.2

customers using wheelchairs
Additionally, the ADA specifically outlines requirements for public transportation providers to include the
provision of complementary paratransit service, accessible buses and rail vehicles via ramps, kneeling
buses, high blocks or level boarding, and accessibility to all transportation facilities by persons with
disabilities.
DISCUSSION
Numerous customers throughout the agency’s service area have reported concerns and experiences with
bus stops, the related amenities provided, and the pedestrian network that connects to the stops.
Customers arriving at a given bus stop, regardless of the entity responsible for its maintenance and
upkeep, should have a reasonable expectation that the stop is kept clean and orderly and that they can
access the stop and board the bus with ease. That said, many customers, especially those with
disabilities, may encounter bus stops that are either difficult to access or inaccessible, making their use
of bus services difficult. Further, inadequate or inconsistent maintenance of bus stops by the entities
responsible for their upkeep further degrade the customer experience.
Challenges
As RTD seeks to maintain a welcoming and accessible transit environment for all customers, the agency
faces a myriad of challenges with respect to bus stops across the service area. Bus stop accessibility
varies greatly across the service area and may be impacted by numerous factors, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Inadequate and/or inconsistent maintenance and upkeep of stops and amenities by right-of-way
owners, and difficulties in communicating with responsible third parties
Disjointed bus stop appearances, both across the service area and between municipalities
Inconsistent right-of-way standards and procedures between jurisdictions
Lack of communication with RTD regarding the nature of the amenities installed by third parties
Limited understanding among municipal partners regarding bus stop specific accessibility
requirements
Incomplete (and continually evolving) inventory of bus stops and amenities

Opportunities
As the overwhelming majority of bus stops within the service area are outside of RTD’s direct control,
there is a critical opportunity for the agency to lead a collaborative effort to improve bus stops within
the region as well as to chart a path forward to pursue bus stop improvements in partnership with local
governments, CDOT, and other key stakeholders.
Systemwide Bus Stop Assessment
In consideration of customer reports and concerns, advocacy and media attention, as well as agency
staff’s own lived experiences, it is evident that RTD must develop a systemwide strategy for assessing
and improving bus stops and associated customer amenities to meet compliance standards – ensuring a
dignified, equitable and accessible experience for all customers. The effort to improve the accessibility
and equity of RTD's bus stops is an opportunity to make lives better through connections.

Packet Pg. 30

1.E.2

To develop a comprehensive strategy for bus stop improvements, beginning in 2024, staff will conduct a
Systemwide Bus Stop Assessment (assessment) to:
•
•
•

Establish a comprehensive set of data regarding the current state of bus stops throughout the
service area
Examine accessibility gaps
Identify a sustainable funding strategy and other tasks related to the improvement of RTD-owned
bus stops

The assessment requires the engagement of both customers and stakeholders to understand pain points
and establish a framework that enables a comprehensive and coordinated strategy for bus stop
improvements.
Collaboration
Collaboration is key to successfully establishing a comprehensive strategy for bus stop improvements
over time. Leveraging its relationship with the City of Denver Department of Transportation and
Infrastructure (DOTI), RTD can utilize information currently being gathered through a comprehensive bus
stop inventory in the City and County of Denver. This effort will reduce the overall amount of stops to
be reviewed and will improve the collaborative relationship between DOTI and RTD as well as serve as a
model for interjurisdictional collaboration. Building off the DOTI relationship, RTD can serve as the
trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to customers and community. Moreover, RTD
intends to coalesce stakeholders across the service area under the common goal of producing a public
transportation system that works for customers of all abilities.
