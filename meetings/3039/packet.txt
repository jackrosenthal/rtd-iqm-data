Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for October 2020. Given the way meeting dates fall on the calendar, there is not
much new to report.
1. Citizens Advisory Committee – The Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) met virtually on Sept. 16.
The Agenda included a presentation on the 2021 Budget and Mid-Term Financial Plan Update and
robust discussion with Bruce Abel and Heather McKillops. The Committee also received an update
on Reimagine RTD from Brian Welsh. The next meeting is September 16.
As noted last month, the CAC is partnering with the Metro Mayors Caucus, local chambers of
commerce and other stakeholders to co-host virtual RTD candidate forums for the three contested
races. Below are the dates and registration links for the three forums:
District A: October 13 from 3-4 PM. Register at http://bit.ly/RTDForumDistA
District G: October 13 from 9-10 AM. Register at http://bit.ly/RTDForumDistG
District H: October 15 from 3-4 PM. Register at https://bit.ly/RTDForumDistH
Finally, an update on the CAC/Board/Senior Leadership Team dinner and roundtable. The Committee
decided to postpone the roundtable to early next year and will meet at its usual time (3-5 PM) on
October 21. The co-chairs have invited RTD Accountability Committee Chair Crystal Murillo and
Vice Chair Elise Jones to attend the meeting.
2. Metro Mayors Caucus – The Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) will hold its next full caucus meeting
on Oct. 7. The September Transportation Committee meeting was canceled. Mayors continue to
closely follow the Board’s response to the unprecedented budget shortfall and associated staffing and
service reductions. On Sept. 21, the Caucus delivered a letter to RTD expressing their concerns
regarding using the FISA capital funds on pandemic-driven operational shortfalls rather than the
completion of the unfinished corridors within the FasTracks plan. We will be working closely with
the Communications team to keep mayors and other stakeholders up-to-date as the Board finalizes the
2021 budget.
3. RTD Accountability Committee – We are monitoring meetings of the Accountability Committee
and will continue to coordinate with staff and board members as the process moves forward.
4. Local November Elections – Attached is a snapshot of county and municipal candidates within the
RTD on the November 2020 election.

Re:

October Board Update

BBMK arranged a call with the Governor’s Office and Interim General Manager Paul Ballad,
Board Chair Angie Rivera-Malpiede, Government Relations Chair Lynn Guissinger, Assistant
General Manager Pauletta Tonilas, Director of Special Projects Bruce Abel and CFO Heather
McKillop. The call was well received and provided the administration a high-level briefing on
the most up to date information from the District. Per the suggestion of legislative leadership
BBMK is working to coordinate a similar briefing with candidates for the Colorado General
Assembly.
The Colorado Competitive Council (C3) on behalf of Rep. Caraveo and Rep. Mullica have
requested a briefing on the N-Line on October 8th. The briefing will include the following
legislators: Rep. Rich, Rep. Will, Rep. McCluskie, Rep. Soper, Rep. Baisley and Senator Story
along with representatives from numerous business leaders and members of C3. BBMK is
working with RTD Senior Staff to arrange this briefing and Chair Rivera-Malpiede and Director
Whitmore will be in attendance. BBMK arranged a similar briefing on the B-Line with Rep.
Bird last year as these opportunities are a great way to discuss RTD’s positive economic impact
not only for the region but the entire state.
BBMK continues to monitor the RTD Accountability Committee and subommittee meetings.
The following summaries are from the most recent meetings.

Many of these topics are interdisciplinary and will be discussed through multiple subcommittees’
lenses. The committee will use a matrix to organize thoughts on these topics as they shift
between subcommittees. The operations subcommittee decided to start their next meeting
discussing the community-based service delivery and equity in services goals. In this context, the
committee will be looking at how RTD works with local partners to develop transportation
routes and services and how RTD services could improve in relation to social equity. During the
next finance subcommittee members will discuss the larger goals in context of the more detailed
list below. The work of the finance subcommittee will be largely segmented between long term
and COVID-19 related timelines.

The equity and sustainability working group also met to establish an equity mission statement
seen below. More information on the operationalizing of this mission statement can be found in

1.C.4.a

Social, economic, and environmental equity is a paramount consideration for the RTD
Accountability Committee. The Committee will consider the needs of communities of concern,
including but not limited to minority, low-income, individuals with disabilities, older adult, and
veteran populations. Actions that include spatial and other forms of analysis, community
engagement, and consulting experts will be used at appropriate times to inform the work and
final recommendations of the Committee.

RTD Taskforce Update
The Accountability Committee also received an update from RTD staff Bruce Abel on the
COVID-19 Taskforce recommendations. After hearing about the recommended reductions, the
committee requested the RTD Board start using multiple sources for sales tax predictions and
that the RTD Board support short term policy changes not long-term policy changes. The
committee also discussed sending these recommendations formally to the RTD Board but
decided against this action after some committee members expressed their discomfort in what
they believe would be going beyond the charge of the Accountability Committee. The
Committee will be receiving RTD staff updates monthly and continue to monitor any long-term
decisions the board makes.
The committee will begin meeting only once a month on the second Monday of the month.
Subcommittees will meet twice a month or more as necessary.

Federal Update for October 6 Meeting of Communications and Government
Relations Committee

Short-Term FY 2021 Spending Bill Includes a One-Year FAST Act Extension
Upon return from August Recess after Labor Day, Congress immediately got to work on a
Continuing Resolution (CR) to avert a potential government shutdown and keep the Federal
government operating through December 11. After Speaker Pelosi made last-minute changes to the
original House bill to gain the support of the White House and Senate Republicans, the House
passed the CR by bipartisan vote of 359 to 57.
The Senate intends to vote on the CR by the last day of the fiscal year, September 30. President
Trump has indicated he will sign the legislation, averting a government shutdown.
This CR carries a clean (i.e., virtually no policy changes) one-year extension of FAST Act’s surface
transportation programs at FY 2020 levels and via FY 2020 formulas. The bill also transfers $3.2
billion from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund to keep the Mass Transit
Account solvent through the next fiscal year. It is expected that FTA will promptly make an interim
apportionment of 72 days’ worth of formula funding under the obligation authority provided in the
CR. FTA traditionally waits for at least five months of authorizations and obligation authority
before making apportionments, but transit agencies’ funding needs are more urgent than ever, given
COVID-related revenue losses and cost increases.
Prospects Improve for Another COVID Relief Bill
RTD continues its multi-pronged advocacy for additional COVID relief funding for transit.
House Democrats are expected to announce a new, $2.4 trillion COVID relief proposal in the last
days of September. While this total is substantially more than the $1 trillion Senate Republicans
have said they wanted to spend, House Democrats have retreated from their $3 trillion spending in
the HEROES Act passed in May. Details of the bill have not been released, and it is unclear if
another round of transit funding has been included in the bill.

Federal Update

1.C.5.a

RTD and SPB have been making the case for additional COVID funding for transit to the House
and Senate transit authorizing committees, RTD’s Congressional delegation, and in industry-wide
events hosted by APTA and fellow transit agencies. SPB continues to stay in communication with
NYMTA, CTA (Chicago) and other transit agencies to align messaging when appropriate.
Legislation to Secure RTD’s RRIF CRP Fix Remains Viable
We are pursuing all opportunities to secure a RRIF CRP fix. As a result, there are four bills pending
in the House and Senate to require US DOT to return the credit risk premium (CRP) paid on the
RRIF loan for Denver Union Station, including language in the FY 2021 House
Transportation/HUD (THUD) appropriations bill.
RTD’s strongest option to secure the CRP fix before the end of the year is via the THUD
appropriations bill, for several reasons. First, keeping the Federal government funded and
operational will remain Congress’ highest priority, so we expect action on full-year spending bills
(including the THUD bill) by the December 11 expiration of the CR. Secondly, appropriations
legislation is an ideal vehicle for our CRP fix, because we require an appropriation and a general
fund authorization to fund repayment of our CRP, and the House-passed FY 2021 THUD bill
includes both provisions. Finally, the House THUD bill has already passed the full House and our
CRP fix garnered no opposition whatsoever, indicating there should be no hurdles to including our
fix in the final spending bill to be negotiated in December.

Speaker Pelosi appears to be proceeding on dual tracks – signaling to the Trump Administration (via
communications with Secretary Mnuchin) that she would like to see a bipartisan deal come together
while also instructing her Committee chairs to have a Democratic messaging bill prepared for House
floor consideration in the event that a bipartisan deal proves to be unlikely to come together before
the election.
