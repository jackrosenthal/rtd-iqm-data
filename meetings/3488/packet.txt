PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In adopting a five-year strategic plan, the Board established four strategic priorities and their associated
success outcomes the agency will strive to achieve:
Strategic Priority
Community Value: RTD Strives to be a strong
community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver Metro region
while sustaining planet Earth

Success Outcome

Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently
deliver high-quality customer service

Establish baseline for customer net
promoter score and increase by 5%

Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and
retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce

Establish baseline for employee net
promoter score and increase by 5%

Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the
management of all financial resources

50% of outcome is that RTD
spends less money than it receives;
50% of outcome is that the
community believes that it sees
value in RTD’s spending

Establish baseline for community
value index and increase by 5%

Regarding the strategic priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence, a consultant was
engaged in 2021 to conduct community and customer surveys (surveys) to discern the agency’s
community value index and customer net promoter score (NPS) for that year. Those surveys were

Packet Pg. 20

18.A

completed November 2021 and the results were validated by a third-party auditor in January 2022. On
February 17, 2022, the 2021 survey results were presented to the Board.
The community value index and customer NPS garnered from the 2021 surveys serve as the baseline
data against which future progress is measured for the strategic priorities of Community Value and
Customer Excellence.
Culminating from a competitive request for proposals, a different consultant was awarded a contract on
August 3, 2022, to conduct the 2022 surveys for follow-on data. The instruments for both surveys
were based on those developed in 2021 to ensure consistency in data collection and reporting. On
November 2, 2022 the 2022 survey results were presented to the Board.
A summary scope of work (SOW) for the 2023 surveys was approved by the Board on March 28, 2023,
and included similar requirements as those in the 2021 and 2022 solicitations such as survey
methodology and instrument design, survey execution, results analysis and comprehensive reporting for
bus, rail and paratransit.
On April 6, 2023, RTD issued a request for proposals for community and customer surveys. The
solicitation was assigned a Small Business Enterprise (SBE) goal of 15% and was publicly advertised.
Following a 21-day solicitation period, five proposals were deemed responsive. A panel assessed the
proposals using pre-determined objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall evaluations of the
proposals, the panel recommended the contract be awarded to ETC Institute.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Staff’s recommendation is for the Board to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to
enter into a multi-year contract with ETC Institute for the provision of community and customer surveys.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the surveys is included in the 2023 Board-approved budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Code of Conduct and Service Suspension Policy
Revisions

February 15, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
June 27, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt revisions to the Code of Conduct and Service Suspension Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The RTD Act, Article 9 of Title 32, Colorado Revised Statutes, authorizes the district to develop,
maintain, and operate a mass transportation system for the benefit of the inhabitants of the district.
In order to provide for the safety, convenience, and comfort of all customers, the agency has established
a Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth rules prohibiting certain conduct that may adversely affect use,
operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles, facilities, or property. To enforce this Code, RTD has
established a Service Suspension Policy (Policy) setting forth procedures and enforcement guidelines.
The Code and Policy are tools in an overarching strategy to maintain a welcoming transit environment
for all RTD employees and customers.
In addition to security personnel and a growing contingent of sworn transit police officers, RTD deploys
a team of mental health clinicians and a full-time outreach coordinator focused on houselessness issues,
in the spirit of firm compassion, to engage with individuals utilizing the system who may be in need of
assistance and those experiencing mental health or substance abuse issues. For several years, the
agency has also engaged with local law enforcement jurisdictions to share resources and information and
bolster the agency’s public safety presence throughout the service area.
Beginning in January 2022, the GM/CEO along with several senior staff members engaged with
representatives from the City and County of Denver, including individuals from Mayor Hancock’s
administration as well as law enforcement, criminal justice, public health, and social services entities, to
form a steering committee focused on mitigating the impacts of unwanted behaviors affecting Denver
Union Station and its surrounding area, as well as other locations in Denver’s central core. The steering
committee and its subcommittees met on a monthly basis with the intent to establish a holistic and
compassionate strategy for the reduction of sales and use of illicit drugs as well as aggressive behaviors

Packet Pg. 23

19.B

by those not utilizing transit services, patronizing businesses, working, or living in the impacted area.
Staff and contractors are also working towards implementation of additional Crime Prevention through
Environmental Design (CPTED) elements identified through a collaboration with the Denver Police
Department to curb unwelcome behaviors and ensure that multimodal transit hubs are being used by
customers for their intended purpose.
RTD-PD also works closely with WellPower Denver to utilize its Support Team Assisted Response
(STAR) Van, which provides person-centric mobile crisis response to community members experiencing
problems related to mental health, depression, unhouselessness and substance abuse. RTD-PD also
provides support to the Downtown Action Team, which includes members from the Denver Police
Department, Denver Fire Department, Denver Public Works, and outreach organizations that focus on
assisting individuals in the immediate downtown Denver area. RTD-PD have been invited to use the
newly opened AID Center, which stands for “Assessment, Intake, Diversion” and is a drop-off area for
individuals that have committed low level offenses related to theft or shoplifting. The program is
intended to assist these individuals in receiving assistance rather than being subjected to the criminal
system.
During Q4 2022, staff collaborated to craft revisions to the Code and Policy intended to align with both
the Board’s direction regarding the restoration of a welcoming transit environment, pursuant to
Resolution No. 3, Series of 2022, and the recommendations contained in the subsequently published
report from the peer review panel of American Public Transportation Association (APTA) subject matter
experts who convened to assess the agency’s policing model.
The report specifically identified gaps that exposed customers to noncustomers loitering in facilities or
engaging in aberrant or illegal behavior that may jeopardize overall public safety. The recommended
revisions to the Code were made to augment the tools that members of the police department may
employ to address chronic offenders and provides additional opportunities for improvement using
discretion; they strengthen policy but notably remain in alignment with the overall goal of contributing to
the RTD strategic priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership.
In drafting these revisions, staff garnered input and perspectives from the RTD Police Department,
Operations staff, and the Operator Assault Committee (Committee), comprised of representatives from
the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 and the Operations and Administration departments, to
ensure the concerns and experiences of employees and customers were considered. Other employees
were invited to engage with the Committee including Legal Services, Communications and Engagement,
Capital Programs staff, as well as those from the Bus and Rail divisions.
The proposed revisions are intended to provide enforcement tools that are responsive to the present
experiences of RTD’s employees and customers, and do not reduce the expectation that public safety
employees apply alternative problem-solving strategies when engaging community members who suffer
mental health crises, addiction to illegal narcotics, and who are unhoused.
DISCUSSION
This recommended action seeks Board approval to modify the Code and Policy in order to:

Packet Pg. 24

•

Clearly differentiate between Code violations and violations related to criminal offenses
Ensure that the most serious consequences in the Policy are for violent criminal offenses,
including increased penalties for criminal offenses committed against RTD’s employees and
contractors
Ensure that recognized fundamental rights are protected for individuals on RTD property
Ensure that RTD, as mandated by state law, is operating a mass transportation system for the
benefit of district inhabitants
Ensure secure and available boarding and seating areas for all customers, including low-income
customers that depend on RTD
Prohibit harassment, sexual harassment, and bullying based on sex, race, color, national origin,
religion, marital status, sexual orientation, transgender status, pregnancy, ancestry, age, military
status, disability, genetic information, or any other status protected by law
Permit consideration of any and all evidence that either supports or negates a finding that an
individual engaged in conduct justifying a suspension
Permit enforcement personnel to consider the totality of the circumstances when issuing
suspensions, including the nature and severity of a criminal offense
Prohibit unprotected speech, such as fighting words or threatening language, that would cause
customers, employees, or contractors to fear for their safety
Prohibit unauthorized use of an electrical or data outlet

In adopting this recommended action:
• The agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
• The Board further authorizes staff to incorporate, periodically and as necessary, revisions to the
Code and Policy, based on industry best practices and in alignment with the Board-adopted
Strategic Priorities. Staff will ensure that the Board will be made aware of any such changes prior
to implementation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no substantive financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

Overview
In 2016, RTD’s Board of Directors approved the agency’s
first-ever comprehensive list of rules and prohibited conduct
on the transit system. In 2020, amendments to the Customer
Code of Conduct were drafted and approved for
implementation.
Following an internal staff review that began in 2022,
additional changes to RTD’s existing Customer Code of
Conduct were identified. In April 2023, an updated round of
revisions and a rebranded code of conduct were shared with
customers, community members, and RTD employees for
feedback. Rebranded as Respect the Ride, the latest round of
revisions to the Code of Conduct simplify the existing
guidelines and emphasize respect for other customers and
RTD’s vehicles, facilities, and employees.
The Respect the Ride community feedback survey opened at
10 a.m. on Monday, April 3, 2023, and closed at 11:59 p.m.
on Friday, June 2, 2023. The approximately 60-day feedback
window included outreach events, community meetings,
media relations, online promotions, and other efforts.
The feedback survey was primarily administered online
through the SurveyMonkey platform. Paper versions of the
feedback survey were also available at community events and
by request. The digital and paper versions of the survey were
available in English and Spanish.
Additionally, RTD employees were invited to share feedback
about Respect the Ride, and paper versions of the survey
were made available to staff. The employee-specific version of
the feedback survey included questions that were slightly
different from the public survey (see page 6).

The feedback survey was designed to be a listening tool and
gather information about perceptions, opinions, and attitudes.
The survey is not a statistically accurate representation of
RTD’s customers or the metropolitan community. This
feedback survey was designed to provide RTD’s Board of
Directors with high-level perspectives through open-ended
questions and responses. While the information collected
through this process is can be used to draw inferences, it is
primarily meant to obtain high-level insights from the
community.

Skipped Questions
With the exception of a select few required prompts,
respondents were allowed to skip questions that they felt did
not directly apply to them or were not comfortable answering.
Allowing respondents to skip questions increases the quality
and accuracy of the feedback collected, as it ensures that the
responses given are more meaningful and reflective of a
respondent's actual experiences and opinions. It also reduces
the risk of respondents providing incorrect or misleading
information simply because they felt compelled to answer
every question in a feedback survey.
This report indicates how many respondents skipped each
question.

Submissions
All respondents were limited to one submission per device.

21. RTD should be for transit. Not housing homeless people.
We want to be frequent users of transit but our station in
englewood and many others are basically open air
homeless shelters. I’m sure many of them are great people

EMPLOYEES

16. RTD makes it, at best, wildly inconvenient to ride RTD. Any
trip I try to take on RTD takes 3-4x as long as taking a car.
Also, none of these are safety issues. Why would I give the
first fuck if somebody else didn’t pay a fare? And why are
you trying to get people to care about that or anything else
that people do?

You need to install secure entry and exit, period.

Loitering by drug users.

3.

4.

I can't choose one -- all keep me off the light rail. Fare
payment, along with the agreement to abide by Respect
the Ride (or face penalty) might help all of these.

5.

Disorderly conduct, slovenliness, body odor, menacing
demeanor

6.

It looks like there was a lot of failure to purchase fail from
homeless. I think they are generally respectful and seem to
appreciate the ride.
All of the above! There should be no excuse for any of
these behaviors. RTD need to quit with their wokeness!

8.

All of these are important

9.

Homeless riding light rails. Would be great if turnstiles
could be installed similar to other big cities to help prevent
unwanted riders

21. Safety general fear of riding the bus with ongoing illegal
activities and sense of criminal behavior.
22. park-n-Ride lot vehicle and personal security
23. All of them. The trains are filthy and unsafe. My sister and I
have seen meth pipes just left on the ground of the train
cars
24. Get rid of the drug users and have security present on all
vehicles that actually enforces rules and makes the ride
peaceful and enjoyable
25. All of the above listed!

26. They all are equally important
27. All of the above

10. Drug use e.g fentanyl smoking, marijuana smoking,
injection
11. All are important. Ignoring any of them produce an unsafe
environment

12. all these behaviors must be addressed
31. One seat one customer

high

32. Threats/harassments/and physical harm to other RTD
Customers (as seen on the news)

34. Junkies riding all day and openly smoking meth for god's
sake!!!

16. All of the above
35. homeless people riding all day not actually going anywhere
17. Homeless and drug addicted riding for housing instead of
transit.
18. Stretched out sleeping on seats - foul smelling individuals
limiting desire to sit near - rough appearance smelly
individuals traveling one stop or from Union Station to DIA

20. All of the above, especially not paying full fate, and if you
have a discount ticket, transfer, pass, digital or paper, you

37. Lewd Conduct
38. allow living and staying on the vehicle--it is not a home, it
is a transit vehicle. This makes it very uncomfortable and
safe for fee paying customer which do not care about. Your
mission is NOT to serve the homeless. Your mission is to

"campers" on board

behavior and yelling at stations on 16th street mall stations

44. It is difficult to choose just one. Reduction of all of these

more people to ride transit. I have a co-worker who pays to
park at work because she got nervous seeing illegal drugs
being used on the W Line.

65. Shouting and being generally unruly around union station
and in the bus concourse

55. Any? As far as I can tell RTD polices trains and buses not at
all
56. All of the above

As a public school teacher, I empathize with RTD. You end
up having so many issues that should be handled by
robust, functional social programs foisted upon you. But
the right answer to this will never be to further criminalize
struggling people. The right answer will never be deputizing
aggrieved people of means who are offended by the
existence of the poor.

8.

Gennerally being loud and obnoxious

9.

Loitering at station

10. RTD should be for transit. Not housing homeless people.
We want to be frequent users of transit but our station in
englewood and many others are basically open air
homeless shelters. I’m sure many of them are great people
but being asked for money every time you use RTD or
seeing a small number of them doing probably illegal
activities isn’t a great way for me to get other people or my
wife in transit

those unhoused to remain on property, including riding all
day on the trains is ridculous. If you want to increase
ridership, allowing the unhoused and drug users riding the
trains and busses is not going to help. The board needs to

Open-Ended Responses or Feedback Provided

Use the space below to provide feedback or suggestions about the proposed changes to
RTD's Code of Conduct and Respect the Ride.

1.

Have more staff, ambassadors or police around
stations/vehicles. Cameras would also help deter people
from using drugs (the most serious issue I have
experienced)

2.

Appreciate it tremendously!

3.

More transit cops arresting lawbreakers.

4.

I'm not interested in a code of conduct. That will alleviate
nothing. You need to fund secure entry and exit.

6.

I support having Transportation Officers on the buses and
trains and also, please keep loiterers/campers away from
hanging out in the stations, they intimidate me.
Will there be enforcement of the new code? I feel unsafe
using the light rail system, especially passing through the
Southmoor tunnel.
Please enforce the code of conduct! RTD is great but needs
to enforce the rules and prohibit behaviors that keep people
from using it.

9.

None of the proposed changes to the code of conduct will
do any good if there is no one there to enforce it. I only see
RTD police during my morning commute (I was once fare
checked three times in one morning). There are never
police/security around in the evenings, or during inclement
weather when the trains tend to have rampant drug users.
I also do not see Security/Police at the stations where the
covered seating areas are not accessible due to drug users.
The RTD police chief makes bank. What is he doing to earn
that money??

10. In order to drive an increase in ridership RTD must actually
enforce simple behavioral rules. The amount of illicit drug
use and overall undesirables on the train makes taking
public transportation feel unsafe and drives customers to
alternative options.

18. Do not want to put the conductors in the position of
enforcers.
19. I strongly support this. I would like to see more
enforcement on the W line. We see RTD staff checking
tickets on the G and A lines but not the W line.
20. Enforcement is key -but the code of conduct does not
address
21. Must purchase ticket
22. I often wear suits on Light Rail. I have tried occasionally
(and politely) to ask people to take their feet off the seats.
I usually get very unsavory replies. Put more and bigger
signs on trains about that and about littering. I pick up the
litter frequently and throw it away.
23. A code of conduct isn't worth much if RTD doesn't enforce
the code.
24. There needs to be consequences to illegal behavior. There
needs to be armed patrol. Not to mention the criminals
who ride the light rail to lone tree and then steal cars and
commit robbery
25. Over priced, dirty and crime riddled.
26. Please help with safety while waiting for transit departure
times, especially during hours while it is still dark outside.
This is important at both ends of the A-line system
27. I'm not sure how any of this will make riding safer. There
is no security or enforcement. I have started kicking
people off myself when they are smoking meth.

12. So it's come to this.

28. Why does RTD have a Code of Conduct and Respect the
Ridge if there is not any enforcement or consequences.
RTD security comes across like a fraternity hanging
together shooting the breeze.

13. Please clean the trains like they used to be

29. Prioritize fare enforcement.

16. What's up with the W line waiting time at Union Station. 1
minute to board the train is absurd.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

7.

The Colorado Station is uncomfortable regarding safety, the
train is littered and dirty, passengers put their feet on the
seats, and there are the crazies. There appears to be no
RTD safety during the ride. So, dirty and vaguely unsafe;
why not use Uber?

15. Providing safer transportation during peak hours. I usually
take the light rail to games/concerts but dislike being
crammed in after an event takes place to go home.

Use the space below to provide feedback or suggestions about the proposed changes to
RTD's Code of Conduct and Respect the Ride.

30. The code of conduct specifies marijuana and alcohol
consumption as violations, but I have never witnessed this
activity that caused harm to another passenger. However,
the code of conduct does not specify cocaine or fentanyl,
which I have witnessed on the light rail and causes a huge
nuisance. I do not believe your code of conduct
amendment is tackling the right issues.

32. Is putting your feet on the seat really something worthy of
throwing people off the train? If there are not other people
and you are not soiling the seat? This is already covered by
the taking up of extra seats when the lines are busy.
33. I want a clean and safe environment

35. It saddens me that people don't abide by the(se) simple
code(s) of basic behavior. I appreciate RTD adding
additional Transit Police officers so I would feel safe taking
the light rail. BTW, being reliably on time is equally
important to safety, in my opinion.

42. Go for it!
43. Good start
44. A sweeping change, strongly enforced, is absolutely
essential. I live overseas part-time and have travelled quite
a bit. Much of the world has left us far behind regarding
virtually every aspect of public transportation.
45. Riding light rail is a gross experience. Every time I ride it
makes me wish I just drove my car.
46. Using funding to clean trains or enforce littering and drug
use violation

48. The seats should be scrubbed & clean every day, especially
on the E train as they looked disgusting!!! Stopping riders
from eating or drinking might help! It’s unfortunate that the
homeless seemed determined to vandalize the seats & ruin
it for everybody!

39. The new codes need to be stricter and more enforceable.
RTD’s current enforcement efforts appear to be
nonexistent.

49. I think the proposed changes are great! We live right
downtown/by Union Station platform - so we see/hear a lot
more that goes on and that RTD employees need to deal
with. This code of conduct change will allow RTD to enforce
rules, remove passengers that haven't paid a fare, are
disruptive, or doing illegal things (i.e. defacing property or
doing drugs). As a female, when traveling alone, I have
often chosen to take an Uber, vs. getting on the train later

40. I have been riding almost daily since August 2021 and I
have seen a lot of improvement. In the Union Station
terminal, I used to see open drug use, drug deals, and
even a dead body one morning. I am a pretty tolerant

38. RTD may have a Code of Conduct in place, but that doesn't
mean riders know it or choose to follow it. It seems all that
is enforced when I ride the train is wether or not riders
have tickets. There are still people playing music or talking
on loud speaker phones.

36. Add security guards

EMPLOYEES

37. You have got to do something. I have an eco pass but will
not ride RTD again until there are improvements. I will
drive my car downtown at much greater expense... to
everyone.

47. I'm not sure how to do this, because I don't think RTD has
jurisdiction over this, but I wish the bus stops felt safer.
My 15 year old daughter feels unsafe waiting for the Skip at
Broadway and Canyon, and also at the terminal for the Skip
at Broadway and Front Range. My 63 year old colleague
was harassed while waiting for the Skip at night recently.
And the Skip didn't come frequently enough--she waited
almost 30 minutes in unsafe conditions. So she will not
want to take it again at night.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

34. Confused about not being able to camp without a permit.
Where does one get a permit to camp on RTD property?
Also, maybe should add (with no syringes) that no foil or
drug residue can be left behind (I've seen more foil chunks
from smoking fentanyl/etc than I've seen syringes lately).

41. Safety, it’s not safe, I have to get off the bus sometimes as
it feels so unsafe,

CUSTOMERS

31. I generally feel safe on the bus as a middle aged white
dude, but would not feel comfortable with my daughter
who is in her 20s riding (even the 83L). Younger
generations will use public trans if you provide a
comfortable and SAFE environment. Keep improving.

person (of the realities of urban living), but I sympathized
with commuters not wanting to expose themselves to such
things on their way to work. I now walk on the outside of
the terminal to get to the escalators in the morning
because I have to limit how much despair and bad behavior
I see each morning, even though I know it’s better than it
was 1.5 years ago. I wish the terminal was cleaned more
often so the smell of unwashed people and urine wasn’t so
prevalent. There was one week it was cleaned so nicely
that it actually smelled good! If that could be every day, I
am sure people would find the terminal more welcoming.

behave respectfully of others/follow the rules.

usage they've witnessed. They do not feel safe. More
enforcement of Code of Conduct, fare enforcement, and
presence of security would be great!
61. Don't be over exclusive. The looser the non-important
regulations, the more people will ride.

51. Opiate and other illegal drug users nodding off and
endlessly riding is a problem

63. Make people pay to ride then they have a responsibility to
treat property respectfully. Food and drink should not be
allowed.

52. RTD is a transit system. It is in the name and funded that
way. It should not be allowed to be a moving shelter or
drug den.
53. I know that it would be hard to provide security on all the
buses and trains, but would be helpful to institute the Code
of Conduct.

55. When I used to ride the G line there was always someone
onboard checking fares and dealing with any conduct
issues. It would be great to see that same level of RTD
service on the light rail lines (W line, E line, etc.)
56. #37 should allow for non-ridden personal mobility devices
such as scooters, etc. in addition to bikes.
57. Is there a code of conduct for employees?

59. Actual enforcement of Code of Conduct. It's good to have
but means nothing unless it is held up. Work with refugees
and they depend on the bus but are afraid to ride because
of open drug use and violence. Makes getting to work,
school, medical appointments almost impossible. Very
happy to pay, but need safety! Seen violence a lot in last
three years.

66. The City of Denver and the State of Colorado has become a
WOKE enabling government. Encouraging criminal activity,
illegal behavior. The homeless problem is a simple solution.
Arrest their criminal activities. There are plenty. As for RTD,
it smells like pot on the trains. The E line should run longer
than the A-line. I took the A line home late and the E-line
wasn't running. It should be running longer than the A line.
Also Denver is pushing the fake Environment agenda (FAKE
NEWS) and making driving in Denver congested to get
people to take RTD. At the same time RTD is cutting
routes. Bullshit! An the code conduct needs to be harding
on all the criminals that continue to make riding RTD
unsafe and uncomfortable. Kick the homeless off the trains.
Stop the drug use. If someone reeks of pot, kick them off. I
shouldn't have to smell pot smoke when trying to use RTD.
67. Increase Operators On All Buses
68. LOTS of bus drivers would be wise to proactively treat us
passengers with more respect- ESPECIALLY ALMOST ALL
THE ONES ON ROUTE 37! They mostly seem HOMICIDAL/
SUICIDAL! WRETCHES!
69. Restore the original language regarding riding all day long.
Do transportation and leave care of the homeless to the
appropriate entities.
70. I think improving the ride for the drivers and paying
customers should be priority. The buses used to feel safe
and they don't anymore. It is almost the same price for 2

65. Vandalism and defacing the property of RTD is completely
unnecessary. Seats and areas sometimes are dirty and litter
is on the floor.

58. The open smoking of hard drugs on the trains after 8pm
has to stop. The residue from these chemicals does not
just wash off. The fabric seats on most trains are
contaminated. It is disgusting. I've personally witnessed
open drug use on the H train.

64. I agree with the proposed changes. I ride the E line daily.
The biggest issues that I see are illegal drug use, littering,
threats of violence, and tickets not being purchased by the
homeless. I've started driving more often due to unsafe
conditions on the rail.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

54. Even as an adult male near 30 years of age I do not often
feel safe on the RTD light rail. The proposed rule changes
will help but the rules need to be effectively enforced
otherwise they will be worthless.

around the city and in a manner that keeps us safe!

people to take the bus as it is to take a uber/lyft downtown.
Most people would rather pay a few dollars more to ensure
they will be safe as there is no guarantee of safety with
RTD.
71. Seems like solid changes, looking forward to safer rides

73. Glad someone is working on cleaning crime and unclean
mess up. These have been a high deterrent to use RTD at
all by myself and many others who would use it sometimes,
and now almost not at all.

75. I would like to see the opportunity to have a cup of
starbucks coffee on board a bus or train. I understand the
desire to keep buses and trains clean though.
76. This is all talk to make it look like changes are happening.
Nobody cares about the current rules or code so nothing
will change in real life by changing words on a poster
somewhere.
77. Provide more frequent service.

79. Concerning behavior is rarely on the light rail itself, but
more often at the station. Lately I find this has vastly
improved.
80. RTD has failed dismally in maintaining both timely and safe
operations and its code of conduct and respect the ride is
mere lip service to countering all the problems, despite
getting in thousands of dollars for its service improvement

85. I strongly support the changes, albeit there needs to be
some enforcement on the W line rather than just the
stations. I've seen some major improvements in the past
few weeks, but things got real bad this winter. In a 2
weeks period, every time I rode the w line, 9 times in a row
(!) there were people smoking meth on the train. Someone
threatened to "gut me" on the train on new years eve, and
a month later I saw him again, and he was openly dealing
fentanyl on the train. I got off and didn't ride the train for 2
months, DRIVING downtown cause of safety and drug
issues. I could tell you dozens of horror stories, all in the
last 2-3 years. I have ridden RTD for 15 years and the
safety, harassment, and drug issues have never been so
bad, getting much worse starting in 2020. Again, I rode it 4
times in the last week and it has been much better, but
that is a notable change from how its been. I will ride again
if this can be maintained!
86. It will be hard to make these changes when I don’t see a
ticket taker actually ride the train let alone check people. If
I see an employee they’re talking to their buddies, not
doing their jobs. But good luck in enforcing the rules.
87. I rarely see security officers checking fare or monitoring
illegal activities. More security is needed to keep paying
customers safe.
88. Homeless in LR stations and trains are threatening.
89. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be the key to its
success. Without effective enforcement, it doesn't matter
what you write as the Code of Conduct.
90. As a paying rider, who also owns a car, I have the choice to
pay for RTD. As a paying customer, I do not want to be
harassed by homeless who use the trains as a shelter.
They have their drugs and trash on the train then begin to
harass me. RTD needs more paying customers, but why
would we come here and be bothered by that? So allowing
homeless to live on the trains and generate less and less
revenue, or enforce rules and gain ridership? I think the

answer is held by your board….and it’s pretty easy the
silent majority want safe and clean areas, including Union
Station! If not, you are about to lose another paying
customer who travels to the airport 2-3 times a week!
91. I believe riders should be regarded as customers and be
required to act as customers. Pay for their rides, exit when
the destination is reached.

93. RTD is unreliable transportation and does not provide
adequate delayed/canceled rides. I would prefer never to
use RTD again if I could, and cannot see that any
improvement will ever be performed.

95. Lack of enforcement of the rules is more of a problem then
lack of rules.
96. Homelessness is a significant issue in our community. We
must find a solution while being compassionate to the
unhoused. However, managing and supporting unhorsed
people is not the responsibility of RTD. RTD drivers, staff,
and riders are not responsible for addressing and managing
the homeless problem that the range of federal, state, and
local officials choose not to address.

RESPECT THE RIDE FEEDBACK SUMMARY REPORT

101. Over the past 4 years, riding the train has become
dangerous. I never get on it unarmed & non of my family is
allowed to ride it period, without me. Seems a bit
ridiculous. Denver was a wonderful city in the 70s, 80’s,
90’s, 00’s, & teens. 2016 hit & the city became a dump. I
used to somewhat understand people drinking beer or
booze on the train. Some weed smoke. Sure fine. I have
seen homeless shooting up. Smoking crack & meth. Denver
has been my family home since ‘76. We are moving in the
Fall.
102. Good luck, overall I have felt less safe on light rail,
especially downtown.
103. Enforce the code!!
104. I have seen fist fights break out and there is little to no
security measures for riders. Many passengers are clearly
heavily inebriated with drug or alcohol use and make
traveling extremely uncomfortable. I have been engaged in
conversation with individuals that make it impossible to end
a discussion and are significantly impaired, who can
become aggressive or violent if I do not continue to talk to
them and there is no support whatsoever to ensure my
safety. As a solo female passenger, I often feel significantly
unsafe when riding the bus -- especially after dark or in the
late evening hours.
105. I have witnessed and heard about harassment and threats
to both employees (bus drivers) and customers while riding
RTD and it has made me very hesitant to ride RTD to get to
and from work. Also, adding a direct route to downtown
from west Colfax would be awesome for work commuters
to cut down on the time it takes to get to work. Bus stops
are typically worse than the actual buses in terms of
harassment, threats, drug use, etc. and should have more
security to ensure people are able to get on/off RTD safely
and feel a sense of safety when waiting for the bus.

97. Before the COVID pandemic, I used to ride the light rail in
Denver all the time, often with my bike, which was a great
way to explore the area. Unfortunately, since then, I have
found it to be sketchy and feel unsafe taking my five-yearold on the train due to questionable individuals on the
trains and platforms. However, I do feel safe taking the
train to Rockies games as there is typically a heightened
security presence. Growing up in New Jersey and
regularly using the NYC subway system, I have developed a
sense for detecting potentially unsafe situations.
Nevertheless, I feel less secure on the train platforms in
Denver compared to NYC. One reason is that anyone can
enter the platform without paying, unlike in NYC where
payment is required. Moreover, there is not enough police
presence in Denver compared to NYC, where law
enforcement is more noticeable and effective in ensuring a
safer environment. To address this issue, Denver could
consider implementing a gating system like San Francisco's

99. I think the changes are great and common sense. I wish
there was an item that included who we could report
dangerous situations to as one of the codes of conduct.

94. None of these proposed changes will be enforced or a
difference made to make it safer. RTD does not run
reliably for the trains, even less with the construction and
there is no real enforcement or penalties. I have seen
people that pay get told they are getting ticketed and the
homeless freeloaders left alone. Extreme double standards.

enforce. You need more security on trains and at stations

106. The code of conduct is pointless unless it is enforced.
107. I would like to see also the buses spread out and not back
to back, meaning 2 #15 show up within minutes of each
other, leading to longer waits for the next bus.
108. Word written in a Code are meaningless and useless
without active and serious enforcement measures. Try
harder.

110. get the national gaurd on your trains and quit canceling

112. Code of Conduct is worthless without enforcement. RTD
needs to put security back on the light rail system.
Reporting illegal behavior via an app does not stop or
prevent illegal activity.
113. You need to have zero tolerance for illegal, dangerous
behavior. Harassment, drug deals, drug use,
defecation/urination on trains can't be dealt with through
education; need these people kept off of transit.

122. We don't use the light rail unless absolutely necessary as it
has become so dirty and disgusting. I also don't feel safe
traveling with my family. The fares are so high I can drive
to my downtown destinations with my family and park in
the Convention Center Garage cheaper than using the light
rail.
123. RTD is a public service, not a product. I am a young
woman who travels on RTD alone at all hours of the day.
The main issues I observe with the service are inhospitable
and inaccessible stops, late or slow service, and dirty
interiors on buses. Targeting the most vulnerable in our
society will not bring in more customers. My friends who
don't use RTD choose other modes of transportation based
on cost and convenience. Adding routes, improving

needs to be RTD's #1 priority through enforcing the code.
Rebranding exercises like this are not going to move the
needle.

at night (often catch the 1:27 a.m. and 1:57 a.m. out of

EMPLOYEES

115. The 15 and 15L lines are almost always unpleasant due to
unruly customers disprespecting the code and other
passengers in almost every way possible. I feel sorry for
the bus drivers - they often have to babysit grown adults.

120. Security present on light rail at all times.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

111. The light rail cars are disgusting. Filthy.

CUSTOMERS

109. I would add that strollers are allowed on ramps up to the
trains, because I ride the light rail due to a disability, and I
was told not to board the ramp with my child in a stroller. I
had groceries in the back and we were trying to get home
and I didn’t have any other means of transportation so I
felt stranded. So, if you could explicitly state that strollers
used by parents are allowed, it would make parents that
use Transit with their children. Feel more welcome. These
parents might not have any other means of transportation.

119. I agree that RTD needs to make changes to their code of
conduct, but they need to be fair for all. Fare evasion is
such a small issue for RTD, and now that it is receiving
more funding from the state, penalizing individuals for
those losses seems like the wrong focus. What I'd like RTD
to focus on most is working with the state and local
partners to address the social ills that show up on transit,
as opposed to penalizing those suffering the most in our
society. I'm speaking of those with mental health issues
and those experiencing homelessness. They show up on
transit because it is the safest, quietest, most-weatherprotected place they can be in a society where precious few
public places like this exist. I ride buses and trains almost
every day and see both of those groups on the bus. Most of
the time, they are minding their own business, and
occasionally are acting oddly, but I have never felt
threatened or unsafe around them. I believe a lot of people
want to penalize their riding because they don't want to
face the social ills that exist. While that might be their
choice, it is not acceptable for RTD, that provides a public
service, to acquiesce to their demands when it means overpenalizing others. Of course drug use and actually
threatening behavior are unacceptable from anyone, but if
RTD really wants to make the experience of taking transit
comfortable for everyone, I encourage you to take a
wholistic approach: Collaborate with partners old and new
to help those who need it. Educate customers about what
equality and fairness looks like when using public services. I
really appreciate that RTD took the time to revise their
proposed changes to the Code of Conduct that initially
obviously targeted the unhoused, and that you are taking
the time to solicit public feedback.

124. Additional police presence and partnering with local

126. RTD is not in the business of homeless housing, you are
Regional TRANSPORTATION District. Most people I know
are afraid to ride RTD because it has become mostly
homeless and drug addicts vs commuters. Why are the
rights of drug addicts/homeless more protected than actual

Regional Transportation District

131. The DUS waiting area that used to be a shining example of
state of the art transit is now a homeless shelter.
132. Please consider safety audits for routes for which you
receive complaints or concerns from drivers or other riders.
133. Good idea. There needs to be more enforcement of rules
against loud unruly behavior, sleeping on the trains,
smoking on the trains, making bad smells.
134. While I want to the code of conduct and rules enforced, I
think it's important that enforcement is focused on
education and deescalation.
135. enforcement will be the key and that costs money. Rather
than giving a month of free rides, use that money to install
turnstiles at all stops to ensure all riders pay the fare.
Should have been done during construction.
136. If people do not feel safe on trains or train stations they will
not use RTD.
137. Definitely needed. While I cannot comment about bus use,
I can comment on light rail. I feel this is a different service
than the city bus and should have access limitations for
access to boarding stations by means of advance ticket
purchase and verification upon actual boarding via ticket
scan. Feel current load on Marshalls checking tickets leaves
too much to chance and while the panic buttons are nice
add - eliminate the majority of the problems before they
board. Light rail should not be a resource for the homeless
and those with ill intent to pass time and circumvent
system processes. Homeless needs assistance but most of
what I encounter on trips doesn't want help but only to
beg, sleep or get high. I refuse to use at night or let my
wife ride after dark. Denver wants a greener city - but
forcing me and mine to use Lyft or Uber to feel safer sure
doesn't work toward that goal. Ridership reflects how

don't know what you can do to stop/police every train, it

subjective enough that it could be weaponized against
homeless folks unjustly.

frequencies, improving reliability, and lowering the cost per
ride WILL increase ridership, especially among younger
urban people. I wish the outdoor light rail stations were
heated when it's blisteringly cold in the winter-- but if we
did that, our unhoused population would naturally gravitate
towards the stations. So we decrease the comfort for ALL
users in order to punish and remove our most vulnerable
neighbors. Transportation is the 2nd largest cost for the
average household. RTD has an opportunity to lower transit
costs and make a car-free lifestyle possible in Denver,
potentially preventing some people from becoming
homeless and giving currently unhoused people more of an
opportunity to save money and change their situation.
THAT should be the priority. I hope RTD continues to
ensure the safety of all riders while also recognizing the
role they play in poverty.

people feel. Fees to DIA are already among the most
expensive in the country - in my mind it's the current holes
in and around boarding stations that allow these
undesirable individuals to loiter and gain access to the
trains that needs fixing. Getting tired of my tax dollars
funding programs for people that should use the system for
help but instead use the programs with full intent to abuse
it. Bottom line I want to feel safe and comfortable using
light rail.

139. I disagree with the removal of the "no riding all day" policy
from the proposal, however the proposed amendment
covers most of the behaviors which are the actual issues
with the ridership that falls under that policy. Enforcement
will be the key to restoring faith in the system.

141. There used to be signs about using headphones with music
or audio and, I believe, it was part of the automated
announcement. Now there isn't anything regarding this
and I hear music blasting almost every day. Please have
TSOs ask people to use headphones or turn down volume.
I politely ask people when TSO is not around but it's
awkward and not right for riders to correct other riders.
142. People must respect other people more/as much as they do
themselves. RTD employee or customer/public.

144. On the whole, I think the proposed changes are very good.
However, it all comes down to enforcement. I also think
verifying that fares are paid will help. Finally, addressing
loitering/camping at light rail stops needs to be addressed
as well.

148. God bless you for providing for our environment and the
most vulnerable! I’m writing to share my excitement and
concerns about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and
pass structure.
It's extremely difficult, but to get
ridership, you must be Cheaper, Faster, and More
Convenient than driving. Seeing a train fly by me when I'm
stuck in I-25 traffic is the Best advertisement. You must do
more of that with Bus-Only lanes, Trains alongside
highways, etc. you must work with Colorado and DRCOG
to Reduce parking spaces, so that people have more
incentive to ride. You must run busses and trains with
minimal ridership so you don't lose the convenience factor,
Especially on trains going to the airport, Even in the middle
of the night. I ride transit to and from the airport, and
have had to make LAST MINUTE changes to my plans
because a late night A-Line is cancelled. First, thank you
SO MUCH for emailing me with these changes. But please
know, every time you cancel an A-Line, you're telling me I
should choose a more reliable form of transit. My just
recently finished 2.5 week trip, I would've been paying RTD
over $100 in parking, but instead paid more to a garage
close to the airport because I knew their bus would show
up.
Also have four school-age children who could
benefit from free fares, and would greatly appreciate that Thank You! I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure
and reducing the cost for all riders but especially frequent
riders through the monthly pass. I’m also excited to see the
free fares for youth pilot program, and consolidation of the
discount programs into one.
I’m concerned about a few
barriers to true accessibility and affordability. The 3-hour
passes, by requiring exact change, will mean many folks
who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more.
Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove some of the
requirements to qualify for discounted passes that prevent
access for folks who need transit accessibility the most. I’d
also like RTD to prioritize finding funding for a permanent
free fares for youth program. These changes would make
our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I know
these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue
partnerships with the state for these changes.
I urge
you to adopt these changes, implement them as soon as
possible, and keep pushing for state funding to further
improve the fare and pass structure toward affordability
and equity to make our transit system accessible for all.
Thank you!

to forward is to have turnstiles. I really appreciate that the

dreading riding the train again, so appreciate the changes
you want to make. Turnstiles are the only viable answer.

time to respond to the issues. This is a huge problem! I feel
that RTD is not concerned about the safety and well being
of it's paying customers and many have stopped using the

162. I used to commute downtown daily, but now I drive
because RTD isn't safe. Code of Conduct doesn't mean
anything if you don't enforce it and have security around to
keep riders safe.
163. You need more seats if you expect people not to sit on the
floor, sidewalj, landscaping, etc
164. I am broadly in support of the proposed changes to the
RTD Code of Conduct, in particular the two new clauses
which specifically ban harassment, sexual harassment,
bullying and abusive language. However, I request that you
please review the wording to Clause 36 ('Unplugging a data
or electrical plug already being used in an RTD vehicle or
facility') to clarify that it is OK to unplug your personal
device when you've finished charging.

trains are being skipped and they are always filthy and
smell awful. The drivers should not have to yell at homeless
people and crack-heads to smoke their crack somewhere

sleeping on the trains and harassing other riders. There is
always trash and there has been times where myself and
people around me are genuinely disgusted and
uncomfortable to be on the trains. If there were better

or better yet connect to the actual RTD server system that
allows a connection to that 5 year RTD pink discount card.
We need to prevent all bon-qualifying people from paying
incorrect fare! This is causing disrespect to those who
qualify, and RTD. And it's theft and fare evasion. Also RTD
needs fare guards on all light rail trains checking that all
people are paying correct fare, giving tickets/citations/court
dates to those who violate fare requirements, and kick
them off for violation. Also all
troublemakers/homeless/smokers/loud people need to be
dealt with. Zero tolerance. We are sick and tired of it! Many

what a mess that is out there. Stand up to activist groups
such as the homeless coalition! Get some courage!

168. Need more fare checkers/security on the light rail--I would
ride the light rail more often if drug use could be
discouraged; I had to move to another car a couple of
weeks ago when someone started smoking drugs in the
car. I would also remove fabric from all the seats so it's
easier to see when it's wet/stained.

178. If you more strictly enforced fare paying, I think you would
largely reduce the other problems. A lot of the trouble
makers simply wouldn't be on the bus or train. (I see more
problems on the train, because there's usually not an RTD
employee in the car.) Also, I ride RTD regardless of the
problems, but my wife tends not to. Even if no one is
misbehaving, there's often a mess on the train that a
previous rider left behind. I imagine a lot of people are
turned off like she is.

169. Lots of words that will be ignored by almost everyone but
gives RTD selective ability to enforce.
170. Bicycle riders are becoming more common, especially
electric bikes. They occupy a Large space more than
normal bicycles specially on the light rail and commuter rail,
so please add something in the proposal to accommodate

172. Since the drivers are afraid to collect fares and remove
drug users, how will this ever be enforced without a strong
police presence on every bus? The crack smokers
practically live in the bus shelters and light rail elevators!

should I? I just them I'm homeless and the ride is always

175. The drug use and crime that occurs on RTD is out of hand
and extremely concerning. RTD needs help from the district
attorney’s office and police because these issues far exceed
what RTD is capable of alone. I’m buying a car so I don’t
have to use RTD, I don’t feel safe. I can certainly say

184. I really want to see a crack down on anti social behavior.
It's not homeless people, right? it's folks who are being
antisocial and causing serious issues without any
consideration for their housing status. please keep using
the antisocial behavior terminology in all of your

smoke fentanyl and defecate on public transport just
because they are homeless.

gotten worse in the past three years. Rail cars are often
dirty; full of homeless or others who clearly do not have a
paid fare; being used for sleeping, taking drugs, and
smoking. There are never any security resources present,
or they are rarely present, when these prohibited activities
are happening. Passengers who comply with the Code are
left to deal with these riders by ignoring them or taking the
next train, which is usually no better. The Code changes
will not make a difference to overall safety unless there is
real enforcement work being done.

RTD's Code of Conduct and Respect the Ride.

186. The changes sounds good, but I rarely see RTD security on
the trains, so my concern is that there won't be enough
staff to enforce the changes.

200. I think fare enforcement needs to be taken off the hands of
bus drivers. They should focus on driving. I suggest a
random fare inspection model, like on the trains.

187. Bus riding these days is awful. You have to completely be
on guard, monitoring everything. Drivers cannot police
illegal activities on buses but having security randomly on
buses and not stand just in the front would deter unsafe
conditions

201. My feedback is to put more trash bags on the trains so
people don’t litter as much or put together a no drink no
food rule unless on the station

189. light rail denver to boulder!
190. Codes of conduct are great. The real issue is enforcement

204. More security and cleaning more.
205. There are a few of them I disagree with - like no eating or
drinking on the ride.

192. Need more officers on rail lines.
193. How about buses and trains actually show up? How about
bus stops that don't look like you're trying to kill us.
194. Go back to having security getting on the light rails
randomly like it was pre COVID

207. RTD is a great way to provide mobility solutions to
everyone. It should only be used by those that need to
travel from one place to another. It should not be used to
sleep, to warm up in, or to cool off in. No behavior that is
threatening or offensive to the majority of riders should be
allowed. RTD should not be considered public space. RTD is
a privilege for the entire community, not a right.
208. Based on my observations, I think some of the
problems/issues presented earlier are connected and not
mutually exclusive. Picking which thing to address above all
others is difficult with this in mind.
209. Ineffective

197. The proposed changes won't do anything if transit security
and police officers don't enforce them. That is also a big
issue that needs to be addressed.

210. Most people feel unsafe riding the bus. I ride almost every
day, and I still feel unsafe sometimes - people who are
clearly unwell, screaming, threatening others with violence.
The bus operators do nothing to prevent these people from
boarding the bus and do not ask them to get off the bus. I
also regularly observe passengers drinking alcohol,
harassing others. For most bus trips I take, over 50% of
the passengers seem either mentally unwell, under the
influence, engaged in prostitution, or otherwise making the

198. Please don't kick off passengers that are peacefully riding
to pass time in a safe and protected environment.
199. Unless RTD ramps up security to the point that every
station has 1 or 2 security personnel most of the time, the
Code of Conduct/Respect the Ride effort is meaningless.

EMPLOYEES

195. RTD needs more security. Drug addicts have turned the
light rail into their little playground to use and deal. The
issue is NOT homeless people who need a place to
sleep.The issue is drug use and antisocial behavior. RTD
has totally given over the light rail to drug addicts and
mentally ill/antisocial people. Nothing that I see on the light
rail surprises me anymore. I also never step on the light rail
without pepper spray, a taser and one more powerful tool
that I won't mention here.

206. If you checked fairs before entering trains or multiple times
on a ride (like the A-Line) it would eliminate all other
issues.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

191. The drug use policing has gotten better as of late. But we
need to see more of a police presence on the trains. The
coverage is improving between Union Station and
Wadsworth, but we need more coverage between
Wadsworth and Jeffco Stations. There are still too many
unpaid riders, and they are the ones doing most of the
drugs.

203. Light rail is not a homeless shelter. RTD rarely (I've been
checked 2 times in 6 months) checks fares on light rail, but
when they do, homeless are kicked off the train. If you
want people to take RTD, you need to get the homeless off
the trains. The best way to do that - check fares on every
train. There is no homeless problem on the commuter rail
for this reason. Homeless on the train lead to all of the
problems you list above.

more officers(they don't have to be 3 of them at one time)

222. Thanks for removing the clause about sleeping. As
someone who easily falls asleep due to fatigue, I appreciate
that this isn’t listed as a problem behavior. I appreciate
that loud music without headphones is not allowed. While I
listed I primarily use the bus, the loud music problem in my
experience is when I’m taking the light rail. I am
disappointed to not see rules on phones. I understand
sometimes phones are broken and you have to use speaker
phone, but I’ve run into many instances where people are
fighting with someone on speaker phone for the entire bus
ride from Denver to Boulder. On a short bus, phone use is
more tolerable, but an hour long bus ride often means I
want to change my seat, but can’t due to disability.
223. Drug use is out of control. Security sees it happening and
turns a blind eye. RTD has become dangerous.
224. Just rode on the light rail from downtown to Mineral. Why
is there no police, etc on the trains. Saw two guys
exchange and smoke meth or something from a piece of
foil. Hopefully my wife and I were not inadvertently
exposed. WTF. That will be the last time I use the light rail.
This happened on4/8/2023 at approximately 2:30 pm. Also
on the same train, two other individuals were smoking pot.

seems a little over-the-top and punitive (washing off

217. The area down below for the buses in Union Station needs
to be a clean and safe environment. I have been harrassed
by the homeless while walking through the station and
standing in line for my bus to arrive. I have witnessed too
much crime and drug use. I feel extremely unsafe which
has led me to drive more often. Union Station is not a
homeless shelter, and the homeless should not be allowed
to reside there as they have. Keep the outlets turned off so
they can't hangout and charge their phones and prevent
them from sleeping in the bus terminal. There needs to be
gates to access the bus terminal area for paying riders. It
would also help to add more buses back in the Civic Center
station (example FF4). The area around Civic Center
station also needs strict rules for the homeless and drug
use.

is bad for everyone’s health. I report it but not sure it ever

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

214. You can't legislate morality. I get what you're trying to do,
but your efforts would be better spent taking care of your
employees and being generous with your finances
(lowering fares) rather than trying to control your
customers, whom you inherently cannot control. Your rules
are aimed at homeless populations, who won't listen to you
anyway.

219. Banning people from riding without a final destination is
discriminatory to those experiencing homelessness and who
lack other resources.

CUSTOMERS

212. From what I've been told by drivers, they are powerless to
enforce much of anything. And having to wait for someone
come do something for up to an hour just makes me late.
Also, I don't see much security on or off the bus. Like on
federal and Alameda you see the same junkies just sitting
there for two or three hours.

218. Publicly acknowledge RTD's lack of ability to enforce any
Code of Conduct in the current environment. RTD security
are unable to make arrests and also un-equipped to
connect people experiencing drug addiction, untreated
mental illness, and other social issues with the proper social
services. Explicitly request (a) law enforcement to be
riding trains and high-visibility buses to discourage drug
use onboard and (b) connect with mental health and
homeless services so RTD can provide a bridge...not just be
a de-facto and ill-equipped "shelter" because our cities are
not stepping up.

226. I don't see any changes. RTD is not enforcing rules, who
cares what's in those rules then? I was using light rail
almost every day before, now I use car every day instead. I
don't feel safe in the light rail anymore - it looks like a
homeless shelter sometimes.
227. post a sign with a number to text if we are exposed to
drugs. Many of us do not use Apps at all. But we have a cell
phone and we can text for help.

231. I think the revision of allowing people to ride the trains
indefinitely (i.e. unhoused people) is a grave mistake. Even
if they do pay fare, isn't it a violation for people to ride for
longer than the fare allows? If you have the code of
conduct, but then some people are exempt, I'm not sure
what the purpose of having a code of conduct is.
232. I used to be an avid and every day Lightrailer from my local
Lakewood station into downtown Denver for my job and
back. Despite my commute lessening to ~1 time a month
in office, I refuse to take the W line anymore and would
prefer to drive as I do not feel safe taking this rail line with
all of the harassments and cases of physical harm to other
customers whom have fallen victim to jumping by juveniles
on the W lines in the past year as seen on the news.
In
addition, I have recently walked through the underground
bus station in the evening as a short cut from one end to
the other and whatever type of gas the police are using
down there to keep the homeless out is unbearable and
toxic. Don't get me wrong, super excited that something is
being done about the homeless in the underground bus
station but for those of us commuting or cutting through
one end to the other, you can't even walk down there
without coughing and barely breathing and eyes watering
up, we had to run up the nearest escalators to catch our
breath. I am not sure of the appropriate move for both of
these cases - but more security presence on trains, or more
immediate security footage on train cameras in order to
have more immediate dispatches, maybe rail station turn
style entry and exits, and only doing the tear type gas in
the underground at like 10 or 11 pm vs when the greater
population may be using the bus system for their
commutes.
233. Thank you for implementing RTD Transit Watch. I do use
that app occasionally. I also really liked the partnership
with the Jefferson Center to get folks connected to
resources and support.

228. "RTS’s revised Code of Conduct will be a benefit to the
safety and security of customers only if RTD significantly
increases the size of the RTD Police force and the size of
the RTD Contract Security Officer force. The Code of
Conduct will be useless unless it is consistently enforced at
all hours of the day and night. The size of the police and
security forces must be at least doubled in order to provide
adequate enforcement. As a City employee with the
Terminal Operations team at Denver International Airport, I
have a vested interest in how Commuter Rail A Line, and
bus lines which serve the airport, are managed. We have a
persistent problem with person’s experiencing
homelessness (PEH) coming to the airport via RTD services
to use the airport for accommodations, which is in violation
of DEN Rule 30.18. The airport’s homeless problem is
RTD’s problem. We have to solve this issue together. RTD
Security Officers cooperate with airport Terminal Operations
and Denver Police most of the time when there is a need to
turn individuals around to get back on the train or bus to
head toward services downtown. But how do we prevent
those who do not have legitimate business at the airport
from coming to the airport in the first place. Here are some
ideas to go along with the new Code of Conduct. •
Complete fare checks after every stop. •
Remove those without a valid fare at
intermediate stops and provide them with a one-way ticket
in the opposite direction away from the airport rather than
waiting until the end of the line. •
Require individuals
to input their initials when purchasing a ticket, and have
the initials printed on the ticket so that it may not be used
by others. Check ID’s when checking for valid fare. •
Invest in fences, gates, and turnstiles so that

only those with a valid fare my board the A Line Commuter
Rail. •
Issue citations, rather than warnings, every time,
and have those individuals removed from the train
immediately every time. Feel free to contact me if you
would like to discuss these or other ideas. Very
respectfully, Dave Dalton Assistant Director – Terminal
Operations dave.dalton@flydenver.com 303-342-4119 "

of RTD, I would LOVE to use RTD much more and prior to
Denver I did use public transit regularly/did not own a car.
I currently live in MarLee and transit is just not realistic in
my neighborhood. My commute to work (DU) is about 1520 minutes by car or 1 hour+ by transit. I do take the train
to the plane but otherwise my use of RTD is limited.
Essentially to say, the main reason I don't use RTD is not
anyone else's behavior but rather a lack of services in my
area. If I had a light rail station near my house that ran
regularly I would 10000% be so happy to use that to
replace car rides!

234. I do have some concern with increased policing alienating
low income riders who should be receiving the greatest
benefit by using RTD. As far as purchased fares goes, I
would rather have funding go to more avenues to get a
discounted or free fare then increased enforcement.

237. Trains became less safe to ride after marijuana was
legalized. More out of balance riders. I used to ride the
train every day before the pandemic and my companions
and I always set in the front car near the operator for
safety reasons.

junkie advocates. Get these junkies out of the stations, off
the benches, and most importantly off the trains & busses.

245. It sounds great but will it be enforced
246. Encourage customers to use the rear exit of local buses.
247. Code of Conduct is useless if it's literally never enforced.
248. I disagree with any rule related to banning intoxication
itself. Being intoxicated in and of itself is not an issue. Its
problematic behaviors that need to be addressed, not a
person's state of mind. If someone is not causing a
problem, it doesn't matter what substances they've
consumed.
249. Riding RTD has become unsafe, even during rush
hour/times when I normally thought it would be safe.
Waiting at the stops does not feel safe for women. I used
to use RTD more often and now do not think it's safe for
me and my children. The current drug use and harassment
on buses and trains and at platforms is horrible, and I am
angry that people who are homeless and/or using drugs are
using our public transportation system as a shelter. That's
not what it was designed to do. I also work with lowincome families and they are scared to use public
transportation even though they RELY on it to get to work,
make a living, and pay to be housed. They will be
unhoused if they can't get to work safely.
250. Include language giving the bus driver the power to decide
whether the Code of Conduct is being adhered to. Offer a
plastic seat liner to riders. Offer a way for passengers to
easily pay the fare difference for a rider who is "short" the
fare.

every other transit system in America. What policies is the
London or Paris or Vienna system using, and can we
implement that for RTD? Thank you for the vital service
you provide!
252. RTD needs to increase the frequency of its rail and bus
lines-- more frequency in service will increase ridership and
less illegal and inappropriate activity will occur if there are
more people riding the buses and trains. Folks won't ride it

235. Formerly, I used RTD quite a bit. Of late, not as much.
Trains and buses are intended for transportation, not as
housing. Homeless people have a right to use transit for
transit if they pay the fare. However, they do not have a
right to use transit as their living room. If we need
homeless shelters, then build homeless shelters. the train
and/or bus is not the appropriate way to house people. I
will not return to using public transit as much as I once did
as long as I am going to be confronted by mentally
disturbed, homeless people muttering to themselves,
yelling at people who are not there, spreading their
possessions out over multiple seats and leaving the train
when they see a fare checker approaching. I will not place
my wife and children in that environment. We will drive,
pollute the environment, create more traffic and fill
downtown parking rather than deal with public transit filled
with the mentally unstable. RTD needs to make a decision,
do you want to provide transportation or rolling homeless
shelters?

for people to not use headphones and instead expect

265. Have the RTD Board actually ride the bus to work for a
week. Then they'll know what's needed, and it's not a code
of conduct. Open kiosks at stations and allow food and
drink on all RTD. Allow pets on all RTD. Not in cages!
Stay open 24 hrs. Allow most everything that is allowed in
a personal vehicle if you want good riders. Spend the
money on drivers and get more busses on the road. More
busses will bring more riders, and more riders will solve all
the conduct problems. The suggested revisions are either
already the law (just need to enforce it) or totally
unnecessary.
266. Anything to make services safer will be a big improvement.
There have been several times over the last year that riding
has been just plain scary. Also, the trains are absolutely
filthy.

enforced. On the rare occasion I see security on the E line,
they don't remove homeless non-fare paying riders that are
responsible for all the other code violation that I witness.

lines are not frequent enough and the rail lines that do
come are often disrupted or cancelled making them
unreliable to commuters and other travelers. It's a vicious
cycle. People are disincentivized to use RTD for two
reasons: (1) the infrequency of trips and cancelled trips;
and (2) the illegal activity. The illegal activity will lessen if
more people are on it-- so you all need to get more people
riding it by increased rides. The current system doesn't
work for anyone. I ride it every day and it barely works for
me-- I live in Baker, basically the only multi-modal and

284. I think before people board the bus and light rail that they
have the fare ready because the drivers are on the a time
limit to get people from A to B and if people do not learn to
have their fare ready by the time the bus comes, they make
the driver late and then they complain to the driver. It is
not the driver's faults. It is the people and too much of that

No enforcement now, which created all the problems, and
lack of paying riders on light rail. People who ride and do

Union Station about once a month, but I don't do it

291. I worry that some restrictions are particularly harsh towards
Denver's homeless community, but I do not have any real
suggestions for improvement. It is not RTD's responsibility
to care for them, but I hope compassion can still be kept.
292. The problem is enforcement of these policies.
293. There simply needs to be a stronger presence aboard light
rail trains of security persons / fare checkers. Not only will
legitimate riders feel safer, but virtually all of the infractions

282. The code of conduct as written is great! However if RTD
does not enforce it, then why have it? I carry a weapon
that is banned by your code of conduct because RTD is not
protecting its customers and me.

290. What good is a Code of Conduct which you refuse to
enforce?? Your agency is NOT a public welfare agency; it is
a transit agency. I cannot believe your ignorant
management would cave to pressure to allow homeless
bums to stay on a bus for hours and hours--it is not their
home. This creates an unsafe environment for fare paying
customers. You overpaid idiots need to get out of your
office and be required to take a bus late at night on Colfax,
Broadway, Federal etc. but you are all just ignorant people
who get big salaries and have no balls to stand up to the
rabble leftist who are ruining the system for good citizens.

279. RTD Bus stops are NOT well maintained. The garbage cans
are over flowing and shopping carts impeding the stops.
Trash blows all over the neighborhoods and roads. RTD
needs to do regular maintenance of broken shelters, trash
removal, washing of stations and benches. It makes the
stops unappealing and feeling of being unsafe.

275. There should be a way (maybe via a phone app ?) to advise
RTD police that an incidence has/is occurred on a train. I
realize that the police cannot be everywhere all the time. It

authoritative figure.

274. I urge RTD to prohibit endless riding and sleeping on buses

currently being witnessed would be eliminated by removing
non-paying riders.
294. The lightrail has become a safe haven for the homeless as
well as drug users. CHECK TICKETS ON THE LIGHT RAIL. I
would be overwhelmed with anxiety to let my girlfriend ride
the light rail alone out of fear for her safety. The light rail
stops/stations must also employ some kind of security.

303. The stations, waiting areas and parking lots should also be
safe and clean as well. My family hesitated to use or
recommend the A line although it is very convenient for us
and we would like to support it.

305. Please make trains, stations ,elevators safer, cleaner trash,
drugs and human waste free, more security on trains and
stations, FIX ELEVATORS ON NINE MILE. They are broken
for several months already. We people with disabilities need
them. Shuttles are never there on Nine Mile or Dayton
station.

297. Please enforce them! I want to see more security.

306. You should include prohibiting sleeping in RTD station
elevators. There is someone living in the elevator at the
Dayton Station and I have curtailed my ridership as a
result.

trains indefinitely. And it would be nice to actually enforce

illegal activity is out of control.
310. Please actually kick crackheads off RTD property
311. It's going to take security guards with non-lethal weapons
on the really spicy bus lines to do any good. The bus driver
doesn't get paid enough, nor is he much of a match for one
or more angry and possibly high or drunk people causing
trouble. Requiring bus drivers to enforce these rules would
be putting them in a ridiculous amount of harm's way. I'd
love to see changes, but it's going to take more than some
new words written on a paper. Gonna take force.

rules. Add more police officers and actually enforce the

301. The Code of Conduct seems perfectly reasonable. The
important thing is whether it can/will actually be enforced
in any way.

308. Great in theory, but haven’t really seen it enforced.
Especially for “RTD Areas” outside of trains and buses.

EMPLOYEES

300. The primary goal of public transportation is to provide safe
(and attractive) transport alternative to public, thus
reducing greenhouse gas emission and air pollution. It
should not be treated as an option to solve other societal
problems especially if doing so, it may impede reaching the
primary goal. My family subscribe neighborhood eco-passes
every year, and my student goes to school via RTD.
However, he often tried to avoid riding the bus because the
kind of stuff happens on the buses is troublesome. Recently
he just got off a bus because "it was bad" and took the
following one. Other times he got off early and walked the
rest of the way. I think it's fair for RTD to focus on its
primary goal and run a good public transportation system.
Adopting some policies that drives away regular customers
undermines the purpose of public transportation without
providing a solid solution for other problems.

307. Since non-enforcement of "the Code" during and post-covid
I have limited my using RTD services due to safety
concerns for myself and family. Will not return until it's
proven safe.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

296. I do not feel safe riding the train. The code of conduct is
great but I see most of these violations when I ride the
train. What good is a code of conduct when it is ignored
and unenforced? I would rather drive and pay for parking
than feel unsafe. I would ride the train all the time if I felt
safe and if the fares weren't so ridiculous.

295. I believe revised item 28 has a typo, and "...thus impacting
the ability to safety function..." should be changed to

304. I would ride more, but I am tired of smelling marijuana,
loud music and just general rude behavior. And I believe
people should be banned permanently if they do not follow
the rules. People need consequences, not just slaps on the

of people to maybe follow the rules. You are loosing your
good paying customers by catering to the bad ones.

319. RTD is about transport not providing services to miscreants.

324. I will no longer be using RTD as transportation its very
unsafe.
325. In my experience, illegal drug use is the most common
thing I experience riding on the Light Rail. I have inhaled
more second hand crack cocaine smoke than I thought I’d
ever inhale in my life, and it’s been especially bad over this
past year. I think that it should be stressed a little more in
the code of conduct or at least made more visible than
sticking it at the end. Often it’s because someone is doing
drugs that they engage in threatening behaviors. I once
saw a guy smoking crack start shadow boxing and jump up
and down to hit his head on the roof, not really paying
attention to anyone around him.
326. Just enforce the current code of conduct. Im pretty sure all
of the things I've seen in the last year arent allowed
already, but I've never seen any enforcement of the
extreme anti social behavior.
327. There are obviously a lot of issues with public
transportation and the fact it is being used as a makeshift
shelter for homeless people because of the limited amount
of actual shelters for them to stay is mind blowing. I don’t
understand why I’ll get on the train and not see a single
employee besides the conductor at any station (E line),
then I’ll switch trains (W line) and see four security guards

320. There needs to be facilities and resources in place (from
the responsible agencies) so RTD doesn’t end up sheltering
the unhoused. Creating a welcoming transit environment
should be a priority. The comfort of RTD has been
decreasing steadily it seems, but that discomfort is caused
by a very small number of those onboard. It’s stressful
constantly worrying about being harassed or threatened on
board, especially late night or early morning.

323. I read the document that compares the current code of
conduct to the proposed changes. I feel that all of the
changes are good, they reduce redundancy and improve
use of language (i.e. zone changed to area). However, I
feel that changes related to the code of conduct should be
focused on hiring more security guards to enforce it.

EMPLOYEES

318. RTD needs to keep the drug addict bums off of the trains. I
see people smoking hard drugs and injecting needles at the
southmoor station frequently. A solution to this is to have a
gate system that does not allow access to the train platform
without a paid fare. If you scan your ticket or pass the gate
opens to allow one person through. Stop this foolishness of
open stations and having anyone who wants to ride all day
ride for free. Stop the druggy bums from using the train as
a house. I don't feel safe.

322. A healthy transit system is critical to any healthy city. RTD's
mission is essential and I admire the hard work of RTD's
many employees into making the city accessible and livable
for those that live here. But the fact of the matter is that
being free from threat and intimidation is a fundamental
right, and transit is fundamentally inaccessible when
customers cannot be confident that they can take rides
without being harassed or threatened. It goes without
saying that these problems disproportionately impact
people of color, women, queer people, and gender
minorities. But the inability to feel safe while taking transit
has ripple effects that impact the public's trust in our
institutions and the character of our city. RTD's transit
customers must feel that they can safely use services if
transit is to be viable, and transit must be viable for our city
to be a sustainable home to all.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

315. Code of Conduct does nothing. If no one follows the rules
now, they aren't going to follow them just because you
change them. This is a pointless endeavor. If you want
to see ridership go up, build trains and stations to
destinations to where people want to go. Not to giant
parking lots and/or stations not accessible by sidewalks or
bike lanes.

321. please prohibit people from riding the train indefinitely,
unless they are clean, clothed and not using drugs.

CUSTOMERS

313. Please make riding the trains and buses more safe
especially since we are paying customers and expect good
service and not feeling unsafe getting to work or any other
event. I've ridden rtd for 5 plus years and it has not been
as bad as it is now. I love public transit but to be honest I
am very disappointed seeing how much Denver has been
deteriorating over the years and seeing rtd services like bus
and rail slashed or routes being late. I am a very patient
person and have always made sure to pay and follow the
rules riding rtd but it is bothering me seeing denver and rtd

on one train, harassing people who are quietly reading, not
even checking tickets or moving to a different car to check
everything out, what is the point of that?

329. I believe the existing rules are sufficient but need to be
enforced more consistently.

331. These proposed changes are welcome and very needed. I
appreciate the effort it took to compile them. While these
changes are a step in the right direction, continued failure
to enforce the code of conduct is the hurdle that needs to
be addressed. I considered proximity to RTD devices
when deciding where to purchase a home. Public transit is
extremely important to me and I would love to use it daily.
Unfortunately, it is far too dangerous, unhygienic, and
disruptive for me to justify using it until significant changes
are made to the enforcement of the code of conduct.
Please do not let criminals ruin RTD for the rest of us.
Please do something.

and national issue, and at the detriment to it's paying

339. Prohibit riding the trains and buses indefinitely and use
them as a place to just sleep and hang out.
340. Clothing-related offenses should be the lowest priority
341. Code of Conduct is meaningless if RTD looks the other way
when the rules are violated.
342. Actually enforcing the rules would be a great start. The
train has gotten dirty, unsafe with all the blatant drug use.
343. The conduct is great. I question how enforcement will
work. I don’t want the driver to have to stop and kick
someone off if they start smoking, it isn’t safe for them to
do that. Will a security guard be placed at each bus? That is
expensive and probably impractical.
344. I have read the criticism of the new code. I have always
used lightrail when going downtown and returning.
Frankly, after and during COVID it has become somewhat
frighting. Denver has a homeless problem and we need a
solution, but using the transportation system is not an
answer. Our lightrail system is wonderful and good for the
planet. If people are concerned about their safety when
using the public transportation, they won’t use it. People
who can afford to drive, like me, will when we can’t cycle.
I used to ride light rail everyday when I had to commute,
I’d like everyone to have that opportunity without fear.

especially want to see enforcement of not harassing drivers

I would also like to see less tolerance for

just a pet or an "ESA", both which are not permitted in
public areas.

337. I don’t know how to fix any of these issues.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

330. No one buys tickets on W line because no one checks fares
and there isn’t a restricted area to board for those who
have paid. The effort it takes to make sure all of the riders
are off at the end of the lines seems like it could be used to
check fares. The non payers who get escorted off at the
end get right back on when the train returns.

336. RTD bus and light rail are my main transportation in my life
right now. I stress safety, most of all. I really enjoy riding
RTD but I don’t always feel safe. I always see people
putting their shoes on the seats when riding the light rail
and trash at the bus stops. Over all, I am grateful for RTD.

put up with so much bullshit that I don't know why they
still work for you. I'll never understand why you don't have
more security, and I don't know why RTD leadership is so

355. I think the changes are a good idea. I used to be a
frequent rider pre-COVID and miss the way the trains used
to be (safe, clean and with fare and security guards).
356. It would be nice if the bus was on time. The buses are
usually 5-10 minutes late.
There were a couple of times
in the past week that the 10 bus was arrived 2-5 minutes
early causing me to miss the bus and pay for an Uber ride
downtown.
357. We need to do something to stop all of the homeless
people, writing the trains and buses indefinitely and using
them as shelter. We also need to do more to make sure
that illegal drug use is not being done in RTD, cars, buses,
carriages, trains, or elevators.
358. I highly support the proposed changes, and sincerely hope
that they will be enforced if enacted. I would much prefer
to use public transportation rather than drive, but currently
I do not feel safe often enough to do so regularly.
359. Please reconsider a ban on indefinite riding of the Lite Rails.
It is not the job nor the function of RTD to house the
homeless, it is ONLY the job of RTD to provide
transportation. There are significantly better services and
programs in Denver to address this issue and the proposed
changes would only make riding the train for commuters a
better and safer experience. This is a train, not a shelter

351. The issues with weapons and drug abuse inside the bus
depot t Union Stations need to be enforced fully on a daily
basis. I previously always took the bus, but I take the train
now and get up an hour earlier so I don't have to go
downstairs, and I walk 1.5 miles to my office at the other
end of downtown. I can't take the people that are there
early or late that have substance abuse, mental illness
(never know what they will do) and the horrible smells. No

354. I think the proposed changes are good, but my biggest
question is, what will change so that these are enforced?
Having these changes in place alone will not significantly
change behaviors because most of these activities are
illegal in other places and still happen. It is difficult to ask
for increased security or police presence with staffing
shortages but necessary for rider safety and confidence.

EMPLOYEES

349. Put more effort into enforcing the code of conduct. I
haven't seen an RTD police officer on the D line even once
in the past six months. A greater police presence would
solve the problem.

353. I understand you're looking to drop the plan that would ban
indefinite riding. The transit system isn't supposed to be a
warm shelter for drug users. It's supposed to be about
getting productive people about the city. If you inspire the
homeless and drug addicts to ride the bus doing their drugs
all day, it'll just lead to fewer riders. I frequently skip out
on the light rail because it doesn't always feel safe, and I
hate seeing people using drugs on and around the trains.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

348. Fare paying customers are being considered less than the
criminal element. Harassment and drug consumption
aboard trains is out of control. As fares are rarely checked
and no security is present, RTD allows fare paying riders to
be at the mercy of people who are muttering, cursing,
screaming, and/or smoking drugs off tinfoil. 15 years ago
RTD was #1 in the nation. Now it is an unregulated, often
dirty and drug contaminated, often threatening and unsafe
environment for commuters.

352. Anything you can do to address the rampant sexual
harassment would be much appreciated! That’s the main
reason I avoid taking buses and trains at off hours.

CUSTOMERS

347. "Eating on any RTD vehicle is only allowable to the extent
that it is medically necessary." This seems a bit overly
restrictive to me. I do not see any harm in folks having a
light snack on transit. For some, that may be the best
opportunity to have some food before getting to work.
"Placing a bicycle on any RTD vehicle in other than
designated locations or without staying next to the bicycle".
I used to ride the W-line to Golden when I worked in
Golden. Storing my bike on the W was an absolute
nightmare, and often made me just bike all the way to
Golden. Standing in the small designated bike area with a
bike (bikes have wheels) was really annoying and I fell over
multiple times. If this is going to be a policy, please add
better bike storage to some of your commuter rail service.

369. I think the changes would make it safer for everyone.
370. I used to take the light rail or bus into downtown 4 days a
week. Since the pandemic, I ride the light rail very
infrequently. I've encountered visibly inebriated riders and
homeless with soiled clothes. I don't think I can ever sit
down on the cloth seats again because they can't be
cleaned. Currently, I stand for my entire trip. Also,
sometimes the train smells like urine. I feel gross after
riding.
371. Drug use and violence are crippling public transportation in
Denver. I’ve been threatened with a knife and had to sit
next to someone smoking crystal out of a pipe. Why should
I even pay my fare if nobody else does?
The Denver
public libraries were tested a few months back which led to
closures for remediation, I dare you to test a single car out
of your rail network and see what your passengers are
exposed to daily.
372. Please quit adding arbitrary rules that primarily target the
unhoused population. RTD is very clean and safe compared
to other transit options around the country, so don't ruin a
good thing trying to please a vocal minority.
373. You don't need to change the code of conduct, just actually
enforce the existing rules. There is zero enforcement on
the lightrail. Actually follow your schedules and enforce
rider behavior.
374. Make the service safe and user friendly for paying
customers. This is not a homeless shelter.

375. It's all well and good to have this extensive code of
conduct, but in typical rtd fashion, the onus is placed on
the riders to carry it out, not on rtd to enforce it. Do better.

OPEN COMMENTS

365. Most of the code of conduct violation issued listed on the
previous pages are all committed by a small group of
people. Remove them from RTD and solve the main
problems, or continue to lose real customers and funding.

368. The trains do not feel safe right now, and ridership will
never increase until they do. RTD is not a homeless shelter
or an addiction program.

EMPLOYEES

364. Actually enforcing the existing code of conduct would go
much further than frivolous changes like these. Additionally,
RTD's duty is to provide TRANSIT services, not solve the
homeless crisis. That seems to be overlooked, as extra
leniency is given to some of these people to the detriment
of the transit experience for regular customers. Until you
begin to enforce your code of conduct equally across all
patrons don't expect people to use transit except as a last
resort, which is not a sustainable way for a transportation
system to function.

367. I would ride RTD more often if it wasn't a homeless
shelter.it would be fine if these people respected the space
they are occupying but unfortunately they make the
experience terrible and unsafe. At this moment, y'all are
more of a homeless shelter than a public transit agency.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

362. Long Term: Light rail needs additional lines going to other
parts of town.
Short Term: Customers don't feel safe.
This is supposed to be public transit, not a rolling homeless
shelter. It is not the public's responsibility to bear the
burden of the city government's failure to address the
homeless issue. You wonder why revenue is low? Maybe
prioritize taxpaying, law-abiding citizens over the derelict
freeloaders that are allowed free reign now.

not just the train...but the station itself. The existing code
was good...but it wasn't enforced. This new one looks
good...but I'll reserve judgement until I see how it is
enforced.

CUSTOMERS

361. I generally support these changes and support efforts to
make RTD more attractive for people to ride as opposed to
driving. There have been times when I have almost gotten
off the bus and hopped on the next one that would have
come due to being uncomfortable with the experience, and
I am a generally fit, healthy adult male who could defend
myself if I had to do so, which is not the case for many
riders.
Even barring threats of physical violence or
harrassment, if RTD doesn't do something about the drug
use on buses and trains I think even more people will
abandon it. I see it less on buses but on lines like the W,
especially at night it is almost guaranteed that someone on
a trolley will be smoking one substance or another on any
given train in my experience. I'm willing to take RTD as I
have an Ecopass from my employer, but if I had to pay
$100+ a month for a bus pass, or the full rate to ride it as
often as I do with the issues the system has, I wouldn't-- as
I didn't before getting my employer sponsored pass.

376. Need to address illegal drug use and homeless loitering on

basis. Security needs to be increased dramatically, there is
nobody around to enforce rules and safety is greatly
sacrificed.
377. The code of conduct is worthless if it is not enforced, which
currently it is not. Enforcement is needed to ensure rider
safety and health. Open illicit drug use is rampant on the
trains which poses a health concern for other passengers
and drives away potential ridership

379. Do not ban people indefinitely for violations.

381. Please enforce the existing code. It’s unacceptable that you
allow the behaviors that I’ve see occur regularly on your
transit system. You prioritize people who have not paid for
the fare which keeps the service running. If you continue to
alienate paying customers, RTD will go the way of so much
public transportation in this country- extinct!

383. I don’t believe any of these changes will be enforced, and I
don’t believe RTD light rail is safe for my wife and son to
ride without me. It’s a tragedy and you’re doing nothing to

389. The code of conduct is useless if it is not enforced. The
revisions are fine, but if RTD continues to not enforce the
code, its just a useless pandering document.
390. Allow E-bikes.
391. I am disappointed that RTD decided to allow non paying
fare cheats to dictate RTDs policy. RTD should be catering
to fare paying and law abiding customers. RTDs clear lack
of safety standards only makes the experience worse and
creates a death spiral where paying customers decide to
not ride any longer.
392. Changes to the code of conduct are not the primary issue,
enforcement of RTD rules is the issue.
393. I think it’s ridiculous that RTD is worrying about updating
the code of conduct when the existing code is never
enforced. I’ve been checked for fare once in the past year,
and I’ve watched RTD security ignore blatant violations
done directly in front of them, including smoking off of foil
in the stairwells. Changing “the code” is nonsense to make
executives feel better while nothing is being done actually
on the trains to make real improvements. Quit writing
memos about how to put lipstick on the pig that is current
RTD services and actually put security who will do
*anything* on the trains, buses, and stations.
394. Please bring back the 122X so l don’t have to worry about
the illegal dog use on the trains and inside the union
station.
395. RTD shouldn't be a homeless shelter

sleeping on the busses

384. The two largest impediments to my light rail experience are
open smoking of meth on trains and nonsocial behavior like
yelling spitting etc. Perceived safety is important, please up
security on the e line. I've had to get off trains before my
stop and wait for the next one due to meth use. Also the
service disruption to the eline is completely wrecking the
convenience. I use rtd regularly with ecopass, trains don't
come frequently enough busses even less so.

388. Please enforce the existing Code of Conduct rules before
making it more complicated for yourselves.

EMPLOYEES

382. I moved here from Chicago, and I frequently used public
transit there. I was excited to be able to use the Light Rail
system, but it is simply too dangerous here. I do not feel
safe on board or at the stations, and there is no one around
to enforce rules or policy. Safety of paying passengers
should be the primary goal of RTD.

387. Kick the homeless off the damn busses and trains. We are
actively trying to boycott at my work.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

380. Former rtd customer, I have gone back to driving everyday
until RTD starts taking safety seriously

386. Please do not let homeless use RTD’s services indefinitely.
It should not be RTD’s responsibility to solve this problem.
Homeless are often times a huge deterrent for using public
transportation.

CUSTOMERS

378. I understand the concerns that the coalition for the
homeless has regarding ride bans; however, I feel that
banning individuals who repeatedly abuse the services
provided by RTD is quite reasonable. I smell fentanyl
smoke on approximately 50% of my light rail rides
(Southmoor-Union and back, afternoons and evenings).
People regularly congregate in the tunnel at Southmoor, by
the elevator, where they also smoke fentanyl.

385. Keep the proposed changes to prohibit sleeping, using
power plugs, using transit for anything other than transit,
and having the ability to ban people from riding
indefinitely. Those are all things that help ensure the safety
of riders, and make transit viable. Without them, I'll choose
to drive.

398. The fact that RTD has removed the indefinite ride proposal
will ensure I will not be riding RTD for a long time.

isn't a hotel, and our leaders have failed us once again. The
safety of passengers should be upmost, and it's clearly not

the RTD anywhere, and I only use it when I'm feeling brave
enough or patient enough to deal with the almost certain
issues I will see on a train. Please takes steps to improve
this once great service.

410. We need quicker reactions to reports of drug activity on the
app. A larger security presence would also deter drug
activity

400. Get rid of the twacked out people.

411. Get the drugs off the trains

401. You need to have RTD officer's actually check tickets. I've
seen so many people talk their way on and I don't blame
the bus driver.
Also need to have a cleaning crew
actually clean the bus.

412. After reading the recent Denverite article I feel RTD
leadership is disconnected from the needs of what the
public needs from public transit. The enablement of
trespassers of the transit system seems prioritized over the
needs of paying customers. Stick to your lane and provide
transit solutions for law abiding citizens. Protect and value
your employees, fulfill your mandate as a public servant
amd service. Make public transit safe for your CUSTOMERS.

402. Used to ride every day but it got too sketchy. If you think
you can reverse that while still letting people ride all day go
for it.
403. Actually enforce the rules, the trains are practically rolling
crack dens.
404. Security is desperately needed. I used the lightrail at least a
few times every week for years. I was only asked a few
times to see my ticket. Actually charge people to use the
service and maybe you could afford security.

414. Remove the junkies
415. It seems like the public transit becomes rolling homeless
shelters far too often
416. Limit people riding all day. Your job is to move people, not
house people. When the temperature drops or there is a
blizzard, look the other way, but otherwise people have to
get off when they reach the end of the line.

406. RTD runs a train system not a homeless shelter!
407. I think this code of conduct is great as long as it can be
enforced. If nothing will change, then what’s the point?

408. The RTD was so great when I visited Denver in 2016 and
2018, it was a factor in why I wanted to move here in
2021. I have been so disappointed in what I've seen it
become. Public transportation needs to be just that, and
not a shelter or drug use shelter. Enforcement of fares will
also help this problem, as would a paid access/turn style

417. There is no advantage to changing the code of conduct if
there is no change to enforcement. Stopping the existing
drug use, littering, loud music, fare evasion, and
harassment on public transit would be more than sufficient.

EMPLOYEES

405. It is frustrating that RTD seems to be taking on the role of
housing the homeless instead of focusing on providing
consistent and safe transit service. I rely on RTD to get
around and if I don't feel safe on it I can't continue to use
it.

413. I get hassled at the stations and on the train by homeless
men too often for me to feel safe riding the light rail
anymore. There's absolutely no security and nothing to
protect people

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

399. If current code of conduct was actually enforced, an
updated code of conduct would be needed. I haven’t seen
a guard on any line but the A line since 2020. I’ve been
threatened, yelled at, spit at, knife pulled out on me, etc.
on the light rail since then. I have friends that have
witnessed similar and it’s absolutely unacceptable. I would
ride it daily if RTDs current code of conduct was enforced
even in the slightest.

CUSTOMERS

409. The rules all seem sound, but do not mean anything if they
are not enforced. I regularly witness drug use (vaping,
marijuana, fentanyl, alcohol) on the train, at stations and in
elevators - and often do not feel safe either on the train or
while waiting at the station for my train to arrive. Using
drugs in public is not only against RTD rules, but against
the law, and there needs to be enforcement.

RTD's Code of Conduct and Respect the Ride.

420. Please make this safer for RTD employees. It seems
retention or scheduling is already in the tanker, the ones
that show up don't need to deal with hard drug users.
421. Enforce the law. Then focus on all the little other things like
noise.
422. I agree with the Code and feel that it needs to be stronger
(with clear consequences) on par with airline/aviation
transportation regulations.

434. Please don’t use this new Code of Conduct to target the
homeless community. Don’t let this enable the RTD security
to bully and harass people. Problems are problems but I
hope this focuses more on keeping the trains clean and free
from drug use and loud music rather than making problems
because homeless people are on the train. Also maybe the
trains could be on time more often?

436. Stop people from sleeping and living on the RTD trains.
Also consider a general hygiene rule, I've been on trains
with others that literally smelled like feces.

427. Shorten it

437. Our leaders — who employ teams of problem-solvers with
advanced educations — are at a complete loss as to how to
deal with people breaking the law in plain sight, in
government-owned enclosed spaces covered in cameras,
which travel on fixed routes at regular times between
stations that are also government-owned and covered in
cameras. And you're not going to believe this, but the
government body that owns both the trains and the
stations also happens to have its own police force. This is
not, actually, a complicated issue. We do not need to hire
teams of expensive consultants or spend tens of millions of
dollars retrofitting at grade train stations with turnstiles. We
do not need a 40-point plan, as was recently unveiled. A
40-point plan is no plan. Here's the one-point plan we
need: people who are brazenly breaking the law will be
arrested.

428. Bring back the proposed indefinite ride ban. One major
issues everyone sees in the light rail trains are people who
have set up a house in part of the train, or who use it as a
safe place to do drugs. Listen to the millions of people in
Denver instead of an organized and vocal group of
advocates who don’t care about the vast majority of people
who are negatively impacted by the homeless community
429. RTD needs to make the tough decisions to clean up their
system despite criticism from some out-of-touch people, or
risk the demise of public transit. This is a no brainer. Why
would you not want people to behave appropriately on your
system?
430. Trains are not homeless shelters and shouldn’t be allowed
to be used as such.
431. Never see agents on the light rail anymore. People are
openly smoking blunts on the light rail and not paying
fares.

and search anyone with foil or lighters in view or smell of
illegal drugs. Also, what's happened to cleaning the trains.
Most look like they are carrying all the filth of the entire
winter season.

438. I mean, first and foremost your employees have to start
enforcing the rules. People who drugs on your trains and
are otherwise unruly know for a fact that they can
completely get away with it 90% of the time. Rules,
policies, and your code of conduct are rendered completely
pointless when standards are never enforced!!!

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

425. I think the 15 L needs security personnel. I see people
drinking alcohol every time I ride it. I have seen people
smoke from pipes. Not to mention the bus is often trashed
with food wrappers and alcohol bottles and cans.

435. I can’t believe the RTD has gotten so bad. I don’t want to
breath in meth or be harassed. I would take the train much
more often (usually A line) but I’m honestly scared. I had
no issue taking the train in Chicago or New York, but here
it’s lawless. Get it together, RTD. You’ll see ridership
increase if people experiencing homelessness and/or drug
addiction and/or mental health issues are allowed to roam
free and harass passengers just trying to get from A to B.

CUSTOMERS

423. Enforcement is key - the buses aren’t too bad for the most
part, but the rail system and certain bus lines really need
enforcement to be better environments to ride on at all
times.

fentanyl and meth have me now rethinking my support.

440. There seem to be quite a few people riding the train who
are drug users and/or homeless.
441. I am worried about how you plan to enforce fare skipping,
as well as the vague language about hygiene that is
obviously targeted to the poor. I want clean public transit
and of course pay is required- but respect goes both ways
442. It's useless having a code of conduct if it's not being
enforced.

444. Meaningless without enforcement
445. Actually enforce it. The trains are a cesspool.
446. Please keep bans in place. People who break the rules
should not be allowed to ride as they threaten the safety of
others
447. Need to enforce the fares. This is the biggest problem!

449. Just please kick off people using drugs on the trains and at
the stations (Sheridan Station)
450. I’ve been exposed to a lot of illegal drug smoke on RTD. I’d
really like to see more security to address drug use because
it’s not ok and tons of people are being exposed to it.

452. Why no dogs on trains? Most of Europe (light rail through
inter-city) allows it without issues.
453. This is all fine in theory but without enforcement it’s just
words on a piece of paper. We used to ride RTD more
frequently to get Downtown but between the aggressive
homelessness/drug use in the trains/around the stations
and the trains either being delayed or never showing we
have steered clear of RTD.

458. Homeless problem is out of control. Homeless problem with
them openly doing drugs is worse
459. Please actually staff to a point to be able to enforce it. Light
rail has gone downhill a lot since the pandemic, local buses
downtown while always a little bit sketchy have gone to a
very dark place at times. Commuter rail and regional buses
seem okay.
460. I have stopped riding the train as much and at night it has
gotten much worse. I plan on cutting down using the train
due to how many times I have seen illegal drugs used on
the train.
461. It’s disgusting how people openly use drugs at the light rail
stations as well on the bus and light rail. People blasting
music out of blue tooth speakers at 7am (Colorado station)
while a man yells at no one and a group of people smoke
tin foil behind the benches is the worst way to start my
work day. It’s a fact that RTD would get more paying riders
if it didn’t seem as dangerous and dirty as it is. The city as
a whole need to get this under control. Thank you

for the homeless is trying to show for that community, and
protect their rights, it's equally, if not more important, for

451. Pets do not belong in the under floor storage. That's not
safe or humane. Pets should be allowed onboard, especially
if you buy an extra ticket. Union station has made some
improvements but is still pretty gross. Enforcing the no fare
no loitering would be helpful.

457. The safety and cleanliness situation at Central Park station
has declined significantly. People are riding trains that
done have fares, consuming drugs on the platform and
fouling the train with their vagrant lifestyle. Do something
or I will cease using the service.

448. The buses are generally fine. People mostly respect others
on the bus. But the trains are lawless. Get the fent smokers

456. Absolutely do NOT allow people to ride indefinitely. I know
many people that refuse to take RTD because of the
rampant drug and homeless use of the lines. At a
*minimum*, can we actually check for fares? It blows my
mind the service even costs money as in the two years I

they are away from everyone else. Don't try to fix the

474. I can’t believe you are trying to increase ridership without a
hardline policy banning people From Just coming on the
trains to pass Out or use drugs. I used to commute daily
on the trains filled with so many people I had to stand
going downtown from Alameda to downtown. Now, the
trains are like a nightmare of crazy people who you do your
best to avoid on the short trip downtown. Now, for Stanley
cup Parade, national western parade, it’s packed and safe
and all Good. But a normal Tuesday to go downtown to a
bank or a museum visit or lunch, it can be calm … or it can
be hellish! I grew up in New York (50 years ago) and even
then the subways were not as bad as RTD. I’ve been
threatened, I’ve seen people Smoke crack. Almost every
ride includes people passed out occupying two seats. The
experience is really disheartening. Now, I grew up in NY.
It doesn’t scare me if people are drugged out, passed out,
acting minor crazy. Which is a typical ride. I could see it
would totally freak other people Out. I don’t believe you
will ever get ridership back to pre pandemic levels without
hardcore enforcement of Laws, and that would include
banning people From Living on the train all Day. We now
have a multibillion dollar railroad that no will use. Ironically,
I travel a lot and use the Train to the plane. There are
NEVER enough cars, it is always packed And slow, doesn’t
follow the schedule (why even post one of you’re seldom
going to follow it. Just say, “oh, the train will leave
elevenish,” instead of 11:17.
Anyway, I voted for, and
loved the elaborate rail system We built. You have let it
degenerate into a complete waste.

466. Enforce the fucking rules! There should be a zero tolerance
policy and tickets should be issued frequently with no
warnings. We have an amazing public transit infrastructure
in place for a western city and you all are squandering the
usability of it because it is anarchy on the light rail. Get
officers on board and enforce the fucking rules!

473. I appreciate that RTD is in a tough spot here, but the
reality is that safety is the number one reason I and my
family do not take light rail. I would be extremely likely to
return to public transport if that was addressed.

CUSTOMERS

465. RTD has added security at Sheridan Station which I use
often. That is a huge step forward especially going into
Summer when crime spikes except I see security
inconsistently. I understand finding people is hard and I
hope that RTD will be able to hire more people to man the
station 24/7 as Summer approaches. Adding fencing under
the stairs there was another good improvement too to
lessen loiterer traffic and open drug dealing. Please
continue to add security along all stations near crime
hotspots and more people will ride and fewer will rely on
cars!!

the light rail due to lack of enforcement. I support stronger
penalties against this type of behavior, such as permanently
being banned from the RTD system so any further incidents
enable the person to be charged with trespassing.

478. You have some busses that are not compatible with
walkers.
479. Temporary bans for people who do not follow the rules.
Lifetime bans for repeat offenders

481. I strongly believe that, if you start enforcing paid fare, you
will start to see a reduction in crime on the RTD system and
inevitably encourage ridership. I don't view it as a fight
against homelessness at all; rather, it is a fight to respect
the law and obey some sort of social structure. RTD is by
no means a shelter.
482. I appreciate the updated code of conduct, particularly after
feedback about ‘destination-less’ riding. The updated
language is much more targeted to disruptive behavior, not
individuals experiencing homelessness.

489. Feedback: I haven't seen any RTD enforcement on the H or
R lightrail lines since before the pandemic. Adopting a new
Code of Conduct won't accomplish anything unless there
are enough staff and resources to enforce the code.
Suggestion: Revise the new addition that starts with
"Occupying or remaining on RTD property where the
totality of the circumstances indicates..." I think this opens
the door for RTD staff to discriminate against people based
on their personal assumptions about them.
490. These changes to the code of conduct would go a long way
towards me using rtd and feeling safe while on board,
especially if the rule changes are enforced. I've used 76
route to get to work for 3 years and have called transit
police every couple of months because I've watched people
smoking drugs onboard. I've made a decision to stop using
rtd altogether because the man who I've seen smoke meth
multiple times now recognizes me and made an effort to
intimidate me today. I've asked him to not smoke before
and have called transit police on him multiple times.
Obviously it would be idiotic for me to continue using rtd
when a meth user who rides all day is pissed at me.
491. RTD’s existing code of conduct is not adequately enforced.
The addition of more rules cannot effectively be enforced
by current provisions of transit security without leading to
flawed decisions.
492. I’m afraid to ride any RTD .. I’m afraid I’m going to get
robbed
493. This is great and all but you need more staff to police the
vehicles and CLEAN the vehicles. The trains are so dirty and
gross I don’t want to touch any part of it.

483. Everything mentioned in Respect the Ride is important, but
A Line sees loud music or videos being played without
headphones often. With only one TSO on train, there
usually isn’t anyone to ask them to turn down music or
videos. I’m on the A Line now, listening to someone blast
music with no TSO around.
There used to be signs on
train and (I think) a part of the automated announcement
that asked for headphones to be used. Can those be
brought back to raise awareness.
I figured common
courtesy would have people abiding by the Respect the
Ride but didn’t know one actually existed.
There should
be something to raise awareness so that others know about
it.

property or vehicles, “where the totality of the
circumstances indicates that an individual is not using RTD
services, contracting lawful business, engaging in protected
speech, or otherwise exercising a fundamental right.”

508. Having security on the trains on a regular basis will help
most of these problems. In the last year, my ride pass has
only been checked twice. If you have security constantly
checking fair and monitoring the trains, you can actually
stop most of the problems that are happening on the light
rail. When individuals know that they can get on the train
easily without paying, they will and will commit the acts
that are listed as prohibited. Also, I noticed that an
announcement has been added about riders not being
allowed to smoke on the trains, but the individuals who do
this, don't care if there is an announcement. They won't
stop unless there is actual security constantly on the trains
stopping them.
509. The drugs and homeless problem on the bus is the most
glaring issue. Some of the bus routes and stops are very
unsafe.
510. Knox station is nothing but drug dealers and abusers.
511. Get armed security back on the trains and ENFORCE the
rules you already have in place. Until you stop people from
using RTD vehicles as mobile homeless shelters, you're
never going to attract new riders. I ride light rail nearly
every day and have had my fare checked exactly 4 times
since August 2020

501. As a young female, I often do not feel safe riding RTD by
myself. There needs to be more security at light rail
stations.

507. Probably need armed guards to enforce fares and/or
behavior

EMPLOYEES

500. Revising the code of conduct along with a PR campaign
sounds fine but is ultimately meaningless without additional
enforcement

506. I think the most common health and safety issues occur
while waiting at bus stops rather than on buses. Which
might be a difficult/outside of RTD's ability to fix.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

499. A code of conduct is necessary, but is not difficult at best to
enforce. Who's is supposed to assure passengers conform
to the CoC? Drivers barely have control over fares being
paid or passengers staying on a vehicle at the end of a run.
RTD security staff are not able to respond to even major
incidents in a timely manner when HELP is requested. This
is a logistical issue NOT a failure of RTD Transit Police,
contracted security officer or other law enforcement. I have
witnessed drug (suspected) transactions, operators being
threatened, alcohol consumption, physical and verbal
attacks on passengers and other incidents tha occur so
quickly that there is no time for response.
Bus drivers
seem reluctant to control unauthorized items from being
brought onto busses. Unpaid fare are very common
because drivers do not have time or desire to engage in
arguments with passengers. One bus driver TRIED to
enforce the policy calling for a field supervisor or security to
respond to a passenger who was defiant. After several
minutes of delay, dispatch told the driver to continue his
route. REGARDING Animals and ADA. The policy says
"animals" are allowed under ADA. This is not an accurate
statement. Only DOGS and MINIATURE HORSES that are
TRAINED to perform a SPECIFIC task are allowed. It aslo
doesn't separate emotional support animals from trained
care animals.
I would welcome an opportunity to discuss
the CoC in greater detail. (TXT 3039948932)

505. Code of Conduct is a great tool. But without security riding
the light rail cars, the Code of Conduct is a bunch of
meaningless words. Put security back on the trains.

CUSTOMERS

495. Most of these are BS rules meant to sweep and kick out

502. I used to use the W line on average once a week,
sometimes more. Of the last dozen times I've ridden the
train either had someone actively smoking something (meth
I think, maybe fentanyl?) or I could smell that someone
recently had at least 8 of those times.
I won't let my
family on the train anymore, but I wish it was different. I
appreciate making updates to the rules and code of
conduct but will it be enforced?

512. Since returning to the office in 2021, I've used both 120x
and the W line 3x/ week. Not once have I seen anyone
check fair on the W. Consistently, I see illicit drug use ON
THE TRAIN. It is terrifying. If security would check fair
regularly, this issue would not continue.
513. Really just need more enforcement.

522. We need to have a safe environment when we travel to and
from work
523. The biggest issue is homeless passengers who show no
respect for RTD's property, other riders (often times openly
harassing passengers), and (numerous times) I've
experienced actively using narcotics on the train -- at times
during peak commute windows.

514. It’s a waste of time if it’s not enforced

516. We need comprehensive solutions to homelessness,
addiction, and poverty. This ‘code of conduct’ merely serves
to further criminalize and marginalize folks caught up in
these issues, which does much more harm than good.
Unless and until we have safe places and systems of
support for everyone, policies like your ‘code of conduct’
are heartless and inhumane.

519. They don’t check any fares and there is so much illegal use
of drugs and graffiti going on

527. Things are not enforced and security officers are under
trained and not held accountable for inaction.
528. Many of these statements are just reiterations of existing
law.
529. Please have security and/or police on every train. I have
observed people smoking meth, fentanyl, and other
substances on the train and at the stations. The I don't feel
safe on the light rails because i never see security or police
do anything about the drug addicts who are harassing RTD
employess and other paying customers just trying to
commute. If you want RTD to become a system more than
just the A line, RTD needs to clean up the light rail trains
and platforms. I and everyone I know do not feel safe on
the light rails, especially after those attacks on the W line.
the only line i feel safe on is the A line, and that is because
there is a security guard that checks fares on every ride i
have been on.
530. I think that there should be more space for mother’s and
children with trollers. Also I think that the driver if noticed
or contacted should put crack heads and meth heads
smoking on the bus should be exscorted off the bus and
make yougthers move for disabled, old or pregnant.
531. There should be a better system for lost and found so
people that lose or have things stolen from them can
retrieve their things. Elderly, women, and children need
more seatings. Homeless people riding the bus to have
somewhere to be is not safe. Those that paid full fare that
has discounted cards or disable during Aug and Sept should
be remiberesed. There should also be a way where people
can connect to their route if under delay.

521. Rules are great, but you have to enforce them. I have
never once, since the W line opened, seen the smoking ban
enforced on a platform. Nor have I never seen anyone's
fare checked while on a platform either. There is drug use
nearly every day I ride, mostly in the afternoon. I rarely
see enforcement. Yes I use TransitWatch and the text line.

526. Allow people to buy one ticket and have it last the entire
day

518. Please please find a way to secure under the steps at nine
mile once you exit the garage. Too much drug use and the
drug users and homeless always harass and try to attack
passengers. I have to walk around the entire garage just
to avoid them under the steps. They try to steal your back
pack and they always follow females in a aggressive
behavior. When they use drugs the smell fills the entire
stairway causing me to hold my breath because it gives you
an instant headache. How can the area under the steps be
secured not with a fence for them to cut through again? I
made a long comment on your Instagram page. I work at
the airport and have to come home at night. I've only seen
security at least once a week. This is not acceptable. My
company pays for Eco passes to secure your jobs please try
to protect us. There's nothing under the steps can't you use
cinder blocks and concrete to keep them out?

525. Get serious about all the homeless drug addicts sleeping on
the trains all day!

RTD's Code of Conduct and Respect the Ride.

1.

People should feel safe and welcome and not be made to
feel that those are unreasonable standards. I want it so
safe I’d trust my children riding alone.

2.

Make it a safe place for people and families to take
advantage of. No one feels safe and therefore do not ride.

3.

Who will enforce a code of conduct? If not enforced, it is
afutile excercuse.

4.

We're seniors and stopped using light rail because of our
unease and the general deterioration of downtown. We
used to go monthly but now our trips there are rare. We
prefer not to drive. We've been here since '77. It's a shame
Denver has allowed itself to decline. No amount of fixing up
will work until it cleans up its act.

6.

I would ride the lightrail much more often if I felt safe on it.
I do not. These changes are just words. Let's see a safety
person on every train. I know that's cost prohibitive but
what is going to make people adhere to this code of
conduct?

7.

I like what is being proposed, more needs to be done
regarding rider and operator safety. Also more fair checks
are needed, and not allowing free ridership unless in
August for safe the air campaign.
I’m this liberal city I’m not sure what else you’d expect

9.

As a professional female rider, I used to ride the light rail
frequently before COVID. Since COVID, the amount of
crime and behaviors have been so bad that I do not ride
the light rail anymore in fear of my safety. This is
unfortunate with all the investments that have been made
in this system. I think if fare payment was enforced, a lot
of the other behaviors would decrease and I hope
prioritizing that is a result of this survey.

10. RTD will have to execute the new Code of Conduct
otherwise we will not see much changes and the safety of
passengers, especially the one with disability will still be
jeopardized.

12. Fare control will hopefully address "illegal drug use," as I
consider both of these items the "TOP PRIORITY" for RTD

16. Have the transit security be able to remove people off
Bus/Trains.
17. Removing the rule preventing people riding indefinitely
from the code of conduct was a big mistake. Nobody wants
to deal with the problems that come with people riding the
bus indefinitely when using public transit. This is a huge
reason why people avoid public transit at all costs.
18. Please stop allowing homeless people to live on the train
and please do a better job of worrying about the drug use
instead of people not purchasing tickets.
19. Code of conduct is like rules you put on the wall and hope
people follow them. They mean nothing unless they are
enforced. You need active police on the rail lines.
Presence of cops holds people accountable or scares them
away. We are not a safe city anymore. RTD needs to step
up and stop playing around with words. Put their words
into action!
20. Glad to see these recommended changes.
21. Maybe you should post the cost to riders of violations of
code of conduct and how respect for system and others
translates to lower fares for all.
22. The rules are nice, but enforcing them is something totally
different. There are rules in place now and it is complete
chaos, violence, drugs, and unreliable.
23. No new code of conduct will make any difference if
enforcement fails. Please post clear signage educating

Union Station being converted to a homeless shelter. Please

35. I think the rule regarding "engaging in unwanted
conversation" is highly subjective, and may cause issues.

24. Get rid of all the drug use, drug dealers and homeless
hanging out at all RTD Stations

36. I like that RTD has kept the homeless warm where the rest
of us has failed them…thank you

25. You can make all the changes you want. Violators and
scumbags don't care, and nothing will change. Asses need
to be kicked, hard.

37. I just read the article in the Denverite regarding homeless
riding the trains endlessly to stay warm. We recently
experienced this on a trip to Boettcher. We’re elderly and
especially in the absence of security on the train feel unsafe
to the point that we will avoid using RTD for such outings.
As for the restroom problem, RTD and Union Station were
points of pride for the City, but not now; the same goes for
Denver’s public libraries and downtown in general. I
believe the City is obliged to provide shelters, but RTD and
other public places, e.g., the library, are not the answer.
The problems are many and long term solutions are
expensive; the upcoming election should set some
direction, but to restate our feelings, RTD is not the
answer.

26. I know many more riders would use RTD without the
homeless bringing their issues onto the Rail lines and
buses. Either do not let the homeless abuse the ride
services or regular riders will leave. This is not sustainable
and will ruin our public transportation.
27. Until RTD is properly funded and actually makes an effort
to serve the community, this is all bullshit. RTD is almost
impossible to use. I love the bus and the train, and I wish
those of you in charge gave the first fuck about it.

29. Growing up in Denver taking the RTD was never really a
goal of mine. I always made sure to have a vehicle of my
own. As I am an adult I want to take the light rail more and
slow single car occupancy for the earth, however, that is
hard when my line only runs about every 30 mins, or hr
and when a departure is canceled it makes getting home
after a work day even more irritating and waiting in the
cold is even worse. If people are to rely on the RTD light
rail it needs to be reliable.

31. Stop allowing people to openly light up illegal drugs on the
trains! I reported it when I saw it and was told RTD
couldn’t do anything about it. I haven’t ridden the light rail
since.
32. Need to arrest the law breakers and keep RTD services safe
for all riders.
33. Why are these people not being arrested. I will not let my
family ride those dangerous trains

34. You have numerous police officers controlling Union
Station. Why aren't these officers out patrolling other areas
of RTD where the problems are happening.

39. None of these "Respect the Ride" changes are going to be
in any way effective. They are, first of all, basically the
same as the Code of Conduct rules to begin with. Secondly,
I know there will be no enforcement, as the Security
department is far too understaffed to make any kind of an
impact for months, if not years in the future. RTD loves
to waste money, and this is just another waste of money
that will have no noticeable effect on the general public or
ridership.
However, I understand one thing: Most of this
is not RTD's fault to begin with. This is a problem at a
societal level that requires the government to step in and
do something. Without drastically reducing the cost of living
and drastically increasing the wages of the average worker
in Denver, it doesn't matter how many "please don't do
this!!" rules RTD puts into place (that will not be enforced
anyway, so they might as well be written in pencil on a
note taped just out of sight instead of murdering a forest to
print thousands of sheets of paper no one will read
anyway), they will not be followed, it will not be enforced,
nothing will get better. Instead of wasting time on
making sad faces at people who do not care about rules
and regulations and will not obey them, maybe try
spending the money you would otherwise be wasting, on
lobbying to the state and local municipal governments to
create places more attractive to the homeless population
than a train, bus, or publicly accessible station. Until then
this is a nothingburger change with nothing fries that will
do nothing.

drug use on the RTD, as well as measures to clean
contaminated light rail trains.

50. I’ve never seen an employee enforce fares on a train. Many
people including myself are hesitant to take the train
frequently or at all because it’s too infrequent and stations
are often used as homeless shelters

people in the system should be about the same.

isn't going to solve other problems of society except transit.
You are losing ridership and public support by focusing on

49. While safety should be of the utmost importance, I think
ridership is suffering due to stagnant public transit that has
not continued to grow (new lines, buses, etc) with the city,
availability of existing routes (coming so infrequently it’s
hard to rely on) and lack of updates to existing routes (why
are the light rail cars still the same as when first

transportation is essential to their ability to move around
the city safely. The current state of RTD does not provide
safe transportation for the majority of the metro area
citizens. RTD is meant for transport not for a place to
house the un-housed. We need other services to provide
that resource and need RTD to be able to provide safe
transportation for our community.

consequences and enforcement it will remain meaningless
as it has been since it was first introduced. I have seen
people harass employees and even assault another
passenger, no security or police showed up and there were
no consequences. The offenders were essentially allowed to
engage in the behavior without any penalty. There have
been people get suspended but they are back later or the
next day and no one does anything about it. The Code of

I disagree with letting the homeless continually ride beyond
their fare. RTD is in the transportation business, not
housing. Many people I ride with are professionals working
downtown. Based on their exchanges with me, I believe
ridership will continue to decrease. The mall bus is not on
the list of buses affected above. Riding it from Union
Station down the mall can be miserable and it is the only
shuttle since the Metro Ride no longer runs (which carried a
lot of working professionals). I have been confronted and
taunted by panhandlers and made to feel very
uncomfortable as I ride the mall bus. I now make sure I
know where my mace is every time I board. If I had
another way to commute on the mall, I would surely use it.
And as the weather warms, it will only get worse.
IT NEEDS TO BE ACTUALLY ENFORCED! Criminal acts need
to actually be prosecuted. I saw someone attack and
assault another passenger and NO ONE RESPONDED or did
anything at all about it. Fare violations are daily

I want to see the end of line exit for all passengers. If they
want to get back on and ride the other direction, then pay
again. I do not want to see people riding and staying on at
the end of the run and riding back. Transportation is not a
hotel. Disruptive behavior, drinking, drugs, and personal
hygine needs to be better addressed and passengers need
to be removed from the transit.

10. Please do not allow selfish or I’ll informed activists or
groups to shape policy!
11. RTD needs to be proactive. Start enforcing fares, start
giving tickets, and start enforcing the rules.
12. Stop putting profit over safety. Start backing up drivers
that try daily to enforce your rules. Stop undermining us
when we try and enforce collecting fare and other rules.
Stop catering and coddle people who continue to ignore the
rules.
13. If everyone paid for the bus these would be less problems
fare enforcement. The problematic people that use drugs,
deface, destroy property, assault people, are all people who
violate the fare. More than half of my workday is people
violating fare.

All the hospitals and more and more businesses in the
metro area have adopted a statement where verbal abusive
language or mannerisms threatening statements or
movements are strictly prohibited and not tolerated. RTD
needs to to put such a statement in the Rules of Conduct. I
would also like to see such a statement placed in full view
on all buses, light and commuter rails. I would also
suggest the verbiage in Item 4. Current: The use of illegal
drugs and consumption of alcohol is prohibited. Smoking
tobacco, including the use of electronic cigarettes, is not
allowed on buses and trains or in RTD facilities. Change:
The use of illegal drugs and consumption of alcohol is
STRICTLY prohibited. Smoking tobacco, including the use
of electronic cigarettes, is not allowed on buses and trains
or in RTD facilities. To this end, I would empower RTD
Security, when scanning light rail stations and PNR, to have
speaker capability to to notify violators to remove
themselves from the premises. RTD needs to become more
diligent in enforcing these Rules of Conduct. The drivers
and RTD Security need to be more empowered to be
dealing with the current dangerous situations currently
facing RTD, and their passengers at the present time.

19.B.a

Use the space below to provide feedback or suggestions about the proposed changes to
RTD's Code of Conduct and Respect the Ride.

16. Give bus operators a choice to bypass a bus stop to avoid
dangerous and verbally abusive passengers.

18. Quit trying to make everyone that doesn't ride transit
happy. The people pushing to make sure the homeless and
drug users are treated fairly aren't the ones that are
affected most by what they do on our buses and rails.
Unless something is done to prevent the drug usage and
homelessness from riding transit without a destination, we
will never see ridership come back. I refuse to ride transit
and do not recommend it to anyone.

22. The proposals are all well thought out and helpful, however
if we do not have the means to enforce these items it has
very little actual affect on improving safety and services.
23. More security like commuter rail has. Have the staffing to
travel in two's like PD does.
24. I believe that one of the most important things is the
ENFORCEMENT of the code of conduct. I've seen numerous
times where individuals are given a pass by the transit
police while they are in clear violation of the code of
conduct. This creates and environment where customers
don't want to be in. In addition, people avoiding paying
fares is a chronic problem and also people using the transit
system as a "shelter" is also creating an environment
people do not want to be in. This needs to be a top priority
in the code of conduct.
25. To increase ridership, you must make our trains and buses
safe. Safety must be your first priority...
26. The lack and response time of security for fentanyl use on
the trains, the lack of addressing and correcting this issue
while many other transit companies nation wide have fared
better, the hap hazard method in which Operators are
continuously relieved and encouraged to abuse the OJI pay
system is the great shame of this company. Static security
posts on all lines, TSOs required to walk all trains at at least
three locations per line, not sitting in their private vehicles
in parking garages waiting to be called is a solution to
many of these issues.

20. Recently during these shutdowns, we are having on the rail
lines, Ive been doing a lot of overtime to help out and i
usually work at southmoor station. The drug usage there is
a huge problem. I got many complaints about the elevators
never being able to be used especially for ADA passengers
or ppl with strollers due to drugs or just being nasty, foul
smells ect. But I've noticed it like that at plenty of other
stations as well. If we could all work together to at least get
the drugs off RTD property where people are going to
work, school, Rockies or Nuggets game and just out with
their families this would really help out a lot due to that
being one of the major problems we are having now on bus
and rail side.

29. I would like to know how you plan on enforcing this on the
buses and trains, as it is so out of control with the smoking
meth, and doing drugs, which I might say has increased
significantly over the past 3 years. Before that this really
wasn't a problem! It should never have been allowed to
start without some type of enforcement

28. Do not listen to any libtard gibberish from the Board of
Directors.

30. More police and security please
31. Stop coddling and succumbing to the pressure of allowing
the drug use to be allowed on RTD property and modes of
conveyance. The amount of drug use that is seen on
cameras on trains, buses, at DUS, within elevators is
staggering. DUS, the buses, trains and elevator all smell of

19. Making these amendments is a great idea, however we
need triple the amount of security in order to enforce these
rules. We need more transit police, and the transit police
we have now shouldn't exclusively be staged at Union
Station. They should be roaming.

17. Honestly I will only subject the company should at least
provide two police officers in each bus or at each bus stop
instead of them being placed at union station. Please
because the racism and the harrasment is getting worse

such as 121, 15, and 15L. It is horrible.

had a problem with one person rides on bus does
harassment of other passenger both panhandling and
asking people for some of their grocery there are times he
follows ladies off the bus. Also on my last run to
colfax/broadway there are people that are smoking fentanyl
on the bus this has happened multi time. People board
with trying to board with butane/propane tanks small hand
torches if I see these items I tell them such item are not
allowed on bus. Many times passengers with have 6-8 inch
knives or swords hidden on them they can commonly be
seen when they get off the bus.

32. Some of the board members need to come down to Union
station and meet with passengers and get their feedback.
RTD is not a homeless shelter!!

RESPECT THE RIDE FEEDBACK SUMMARY REPORT

37. Eliminate the Board of Directors!
38. homeless people riding all day not actually going anywhere
needs to be prohibited. the fare needs to be stringently
enforced. drivers/operators need the power to eject any
passenger at any time for any or no reason.
39. I believe that if we simply enforce fares, we will clean up
most of the problem. Those who cause most of the issues
aren't paying customers. If someone doesn't pay, they
should be escorted off the bus/train. I also would like to
see more police presence at stations. Waiting alone at
night at stations like Wadsworth, Sheridan, Decatur/Federal
on the W line is not comfortable.
40. Not sure what the changes are, but would just like to see
roaming fare checks, or action taken on the worst
offenders. Much of this could be improved by moving bus
stops closer/farther to problem intersections so that people
don't hang out until they feel like a driver will let them on
for free or with prohibited items. Posting the code of
conduct on brochures in the bus would help so that
passengers would know what drivers can enforce.
41. I do not agree with the proposal to permit individuals to
ride buses or trains indefinitely
42. 1) Remove the section that said that music or streaming is
prohibited *if* it is loud enough to be disruptive. That kind
of ambiguity means that passengers get to make their own
decision about whether they're being disruptive, and they
will always believe that they aren't. Playing any music,
streaming any videos, watching any reels with the sound
on, etc. is disruptive at even the lowest volume level,
especially for individuals with cognitive disabilities.
2)
Enforce these rules, especially at the start. Enforce them
thoroughly and punitively. If we make it clear from the
outset that respecting the ride is not just a request but a
requirement, that will ripple through RTD and create a
culture of safety and respect. Then we can ease off on

36. You need to prohibit loitering. This includes laying on the
floor, benches and in elevators. It's not criminalizing
homelessness, it's a code of conduct violation not a crime,
there is a difference. It is a crime to not pay fare (theft of
services) and that does need to be addressed. Shelters and
resources are available for homeless people. RTD is not a
homeless shelter and should not be treated as such.

EMPLOYEES

34. It will not matter what changes are proposed; there will not
be the enforcement to uphold them. Martingano lives in a
fantasy land of fairies and unicorns if he thinks he can hire
200 PD officers when the other local police departments
that are larger and more visible can't even hire to satisfy
their own staffing needs. Assigning new rules will be
ineffective against people who don't care about them or the
law in general if there will be no one to enforce it - and
there will be no one to enforce it. This is all just a
placebo to make people feel better, but will do absolutely
nothing to actually address any of the issues. I know
options are limited with staffing as hard to fill as it is, but I

35. No

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

33. I think RTD is a positive presence in our communities and
contributes and participates in various ways to assist those
in need. We are not the cause of, nor should we be, as a
transportation agency, expected to be the solution to the
increasing number of transients in Colorado. We must
certainly have compassion for those in need, however RTD
is not an outreach service. The concept of allowing people
to use our services without paying is ridiculous. Why would
any paying customer continue to pay after witnessing
repeated violations without consequences? Keeping nonpaying subjects off our vehicles and properties will
contribute to a reduction in drug use, violence, weapons
calls and disturbances in our transit system and likely an
increase in paying ridership. The elevators in many of our
stations are unusable due to people living in them, the
effects of non-stop drug use inside them or people using
them as toilets. In my position I receive 20-50 complaints
per day from passengers, employees, security and officers
regarding disgusting, dangerous and lewd behaviors
occurring on RTD property. I would never recommend to
anyone I care about that they use RTD services.

anything without being bombarded by the drug use, being
assaulted, being accosted, being threatened or worse! I
would never allow someone I know, be it friends or family
to ever ride a bus or train and I would have them avoid
RTD property at all cost! Security and RTD police are not
allowed to enforce anything. All the dirtbags are told is to
leave property, and if they are given a suspension, that is
nothing more than a piece of paper that has no teeth to it.
That subject will just be back the next day, if not the next

not prosecuting so many of these drug offenses and

trains and buses, then we need to make it clear to the
public, and especially to those individuals who abuse our
current lax enforcement of these policies, that we take

43. I have personally witnessed several acts of
aggression/violence because of mental health disorders and
drug use that make using RTD uncomfortable and
downright scary.

RESPECT THE RIDE FEEDBACK SUMMARY REPORT

54. I feel that management should come and ride the troubled
routes to see what the bus and train operators go through.
There needs to be more police and transit officers and
some stops.
55. We have to enforce fare and remove individuals who refuse
to pay. We are running a business not a charity. We are
not a shelter for the homeless. People who would normally
use our service don't because of what we allow. We have
to stop being afraid of the loud minority 1% complaining to
Kyle Clark and 9 News. If we enforce fare every single
problem we have will improve. Most importantly the safety
and security of our employees and passengers. Our
ridership will also improve. If we truly care about the
safety and security of our employees and passengers we
will enforce these changes to the fullest with no exceptions.
56. I have been taking the rail for a month to and from work.
The trains are filthy the floors are covered in trash. there is
gunk along the seats and sides of the train. The seats are
stained with God know what. Some of the people riding
these trains are terrifying. I am more concerned about the
young thugs on the train being loud, using aggressive and
lewd language, and carrying what appear to be weapons
and smoking vapes. Then there are the transients that
board the train AND the mall ride with alcohol, contraband,

AVAILABLE on the app. They are the main source of travel
for the transients who get them from others or out of the

46. May have random fare checks for different bus routes or
known drug use, even the areas where there is high traffic

52. RTD needs to be more compassionate with our current
"fare paying customer" base. The ongoing drug and mental
crisis with no repercussion, has been a major contributor to
our "mediocre" performance, based off of what is being
voiced on a daily basis by these fare paying
customers.Those parties that are vocal in their criticism
towards how we need to run our operations, need to stop
meddling and focus at what they claim to be "specialist" in,
and let RTD be specialist at what we do. I am also
somewhat disappointed about the last minute amendments
made to our new Code of Conduct. I feel that this will
continue to allow the ongoing problems to continue, but I
also understand that we are just trying to please those that
oppose and criticize us, for trying to do the right thing.
Once all parties involved can come to some sort of mutual
agreement, things will continue down the same path.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

45. This agency displayed cowardice in the face of opposition
from the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless; they do not
work at RTD, they do not pay the bills that RTD does for
keeping buses and trains running. Why are they allowed to
dictate policy?

51. Enforcement of Code of Conduct. Riding the trains to be
seen more.

CUSTOMERS

44. As an RTD employee, I wholeheartedly agree with the
proposed changes. No amount of employee or public
outreach, however, will change the fact that transit police
officers need an enforcement tool that will allow them to
ensure the security of employees and customers who rely
on RTD services. The code is that tool. Moreover, the
Customer Code of Conduct is not a criminal code; it is a list
of simple agreements. Abiding by these agreements is not
difficult. If you don't harass fellow passengers or smoke
fentanyl on the train, you get to stay aboard for the
duration of your journey or the expiration of your paid fare,
whichever comes first. Anyone willfully choosing to ignore
these agreements has opted to forfeit the right to access
transit services for some length of time, depending on the
frequency and the severity of the offense. No other public
entity would permit the types of behavior regularly seen on
RTD property and vehicles. Why should RTD continue to
tolerate the bad behavior of a subset of individuals, many
of whom don't even pay for the privilege of access?

50. Until you let operators eject/not serve offending riders, the
problems will continue and/or get worse.

rarely see transit police or contracted security.
69. Until Den DA will prosecute offenders, nothing will help and
ridership will continue to decline

58. Better/faster security response.

71. The drug usage on the trains are my biggest problem and
people riding all day without fare. In my opinion, having
security on platforms and drug free trains will increase
ridership.

59. There needs to be consequences for smoking drugs and
threatening drivers. More and more drivers are pulled from
their busses because they've inhaled drugs while driving.
You shouldn't have to worry about breathing or being hit at
work. Maybe more drivers would stay if they felt safer at
work. Also passengers, including children shouldn't have to
breathe poison to get to school.
60. I like that the proposed changes would clearly outline some
behaviors as not allowed - like refusing to move out of the
securement area.

72. I routinely field concerns about the use of drugs and
threats against passengers and employees that often
include photos and videos that are disturbing. As I myself
am a formerly homeless person, I do have some empathy
toward those who are overrepresented in these disruptive
elements, however, it is not RTD's role to provide social
services. Our job is to provide reliable and safe
transportation services to our customers, full stop.
73. I am not that familiar with the proposals to create accurate
feedback or suggestions concerning the customer code of

63. I strongly agree about the proposed changes to RTD's code
of conduct. Thank you!
64. The homeless should not be allowed to ride endlessly on
our vehicles. We are not allowing them to loiter on our
properties/boarding areas to scare people away. Why
should they then be allowed to reside endlessly on the
vehicles. Does that not pose the same risk/offense to
paying riders and in a then confined area? I don't get it.

66. The proposed amendments will only work if they are
enforced and if RTD stands behind those policies.
67. Deny free rides for the homeless. Either all pay, or no one
pays.

the passenger experience.

specific. This isn't what the survey is asking, but I'd love to
see more security personnel on trains & buses.
78. What we need to figure out is how to enforce the new code
of conduct.
79. While I believe the addition to more conduct codes is a
good thing, the enforcement of the conduct code would
actually be more effective. I do believe at this time RTD
does NOT have the means to properly enforce the current
conduct code nor the new proposed conduct code. So
changing anything will have no effect until RTD has the
means and manpower to enforce anything.

Respect and Treat People as you would want to be treated.
Respect can be given; however, Respect is also Earned
through Actions and Deeds. Conduct is a part of each of
our own choices and actions. Second, I would like to
address the Respect the Ride Survey. Questions 2, 5, 6,
and 7, do not have an "Other" or "Do Not Know" answer
available. The Survey assumes that I understand RTD's
Code of Conduct Policy and the proposed changes to RTD's
Code of Conduct being proposed. OK, I can look for the
Policy and Proposed Changes and answer, fair enough, but
this would not take 5 minutes to take the survey. Surveys
should be focused on my opinions, not on my knowledge of
issues on Bus and Train Routes I may or may not be
familiar with. If you want to understand, through a survey,
what our opinions are, open the survey up to our concerns,
not our knowledge of the Rail and Bus Route issues system
wide. Look at the Security Data for the "Hot Spots".

center area to enforce the code

93. The new provision forbidding "Occupying or remaining on
RTD property where the totality of the circumstances
indicates that an individual is not using RTD services" is
leaves much to interpretation of a responding officer and is
open to abuse without strict oversight. Additionally, as the
agency transitions to more enforcement by agency sworn
personnel, it should be considered whether it remains
appropriate for a supervisor of said sworn personnel to hold
responsibility for appeals of service suspensions.

86. It was best said RTD is a transportation agency built to
move people and not house them. While RTD services are
an integral part of solving crises by moving people to get
help, get to work, or get home. Without setting a clear
precedent for a clean, safe, and reliable transit system by
enacting a strong code of conduct does a disservice to RTD
patrons and the communities with RTD. It is clear those
who cause the most issues within RTD do not seek help
from those who oppose stricter enforcement. And those
who oppose sticker changes only seek the benefit of
passing the problem along to an agency not fully suited to

88. While illicit drugs are currently a very hot topic for public
transits, I believe that violence over fare issues are much
more of a safety issue for our operators. In fact, the
majority of operator's complaints to division leadership are
fare disputes and the policy surrounding it.

were getting people NOT riding RTD out of the stations

we were on had a gag worth smell of urine and/or feces.

friends as patrons. RTD will get a bad reputation that will
be hard to overcome.

107. RTD is not the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. While
homelessness is a great concern it is not RTD's
responsibility to offer refuge from the cold, the rain, the
snow, the heat or any outside situations. People who pay
the fair to get to work, school, and appointments should
have clean transportation. Many homeless people feel
entitled on our buses and trains, they are trashy and rude.
They defecate and urinate at will. When a member of our
board cares more about the homeless population than the
employees and valid customers we have a problem. There
are other resources that should be utilized to help those in
need RTD is not responsible and should not be made to feel
that they are not doing there part

EMPLOYEES

100. I disagree with RTD backing away from preventing
homeless people from riding the system all day. I worry
about picking up lice, scabies, fleas, bed bugs or any
myriad of things and bringing it home to my family. No
other regular business in the Denver Metro area would
gladly open their doors daily and allow the homeless to
come in and hang out. RTD should not be shamed into
doing so either. We are "people moving people" and
"making lives better through connections", not in the
business of housing the homeless. Just this morning man
got on the bus wrapped in a sheet. He looked at me and
started talking about murdering people and having children
murder people.... I was going to leave the bus just to get
away from him. Luckily he got off at the next stop. I had
no idea if he was carrying a weapon under his sheet. I was
really frightened. This is not safe or relaxing, like RTD
wants it to be.

I was happy to start taking light rail again when I started
my current position at RTD in the Fall 2022 but then I

however based on feedback I have received that is what
my responses revolved around. I feel like public safety as
well as commuter comfort has been affected and has a
large impact on everyone and desperately needs to be
addressed.

104. I think the code of conduct certainly makes it clear what is
not appropriate behavior on buses and trains. However,
how will it be enforced?

19.B.a

Use the space below to provide feedback or suggestions about the proposed changes to
RTD's Code of Conduct and Respect the Ride.

POLICIES. Denver and RTD should be ashamed at what
they have let happen downtown since 2020 and the
homeless took over the streets busses trains, DUS, the
shuttle, etc etc etc

114. Codes and laws don’t apply to criminals. Action is what
affects them.

116. Vaping must be included. Smoking is not clear enough, ecigarettes is not clear enough, tobacco products is not clear
enough. It also needs to be specified that making any kind
of noise through phone or external speakers is disruptive
and prohibited, not just music.
117. Put in smoke detectors in bus to alert the driver. Have more
transit police on bus to in force fair and safety.
118. The rules need to be enforced more. Without enforcement
rules are useless.

120. Checking for paid fares will eliminate most of the other
unwanted riders who do drugs, sell drugs, ride trains to
stay warm/cool, etc.

126. N/A
127. Enforcement needs to be part of the proposed changes.
Without enforcement, any changes to the Code are
meaningless.
128. I agree with the proposed changes. I don't agree with the
advocates that think RTD vehicles should be used for
sleeping and other activities. RTD is not a hotel or a social
service agency. The same advocates have rules in their
shelters, no drugs, no alchohol, no intoxication, no unruly
behavior. None of this should be tolerated on RTD services
either. I care about the single women, the families with
young children that have to be subjected to dangerous and
illegal behaviors
129. The proposed changes are fine; however, I want to be able
to see enforcement of them.
130. Read them all. Very good.
131. I think the revisions are fair and address the needs to
Respect the Ride without being too harsh.
132. All of the proposed changes look good. I am surprised that
some of them weren't already included.
The real key is
enforcement. I rarely ir ever see a driver/conductor enforce
the fare while customers are boarding buses or when the
train is rolling.
I know that RTD is trying to remedy this,
but I can't stress how much I hear that "We'd use it more,
if the vagrants were not on the buses/trains being
disruptive". RTD needs to provide for itself by encouraging
the (Paying) customers comfort, not being an arm of the
social welfare establishment. In additional, RTD should
enforcement of the disembarkation of those being antisocial on the buses and trains regardless of fare purchase.
133. No free rides. Not aloud round trips. Get rid of regional
fare’s. No coins for the new fare change.

OPEN COMMENTS

121. I agree with the changes the problem is enforcing the rules.
We need security on trains with the authority to enforce the
rules and ban people from the RTD system. Too many
people take advantage of a system because of RTD's weak
enforcement. I don't want to ride a train or stand at a
platform where someone is doing drugs, homelessness
hanging around the platforms or trying to camp on the
trains.

125. No more RTD employees' assaults

EMPLOYEES

119. You must do something about the homeless destroying
things to the point that tax/fare paying citizens cannot
safely enjoy and utilize your facilities.

124. Why not put in there that abusive language, profanity or
threatening statements are required when riding or calling
into RTD.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

115. Enforce the no animals policy except service animals.

123. Have security on the train check fares and enforce code of
conduct violations on the trains. I have watched security
not check fares and walk right by people who are actively
drinking beer and have loud music playing on phones.

CUSTOMERS

113. You people have missed the boat completely! In no way will
changing the code of conduct help until you quit
chickensh__ting around and not enforce the rules. Pardon
my French. Nothing will change until you actually stop
people from acting like animals. And to be perfectly honest
I feel like the whole board needs to be fire one by one until
you start supporting the RTD employees more and
enforcing the rules! Nothing will ever change until you gain
some backbone and do your job, and not just talk about
what needs to be changed. I agree that police do need to
be better trained but the defu d the police crap has been
nothing but a horrible social experiment gone wrong.we
need to see change!

122. It seems that they just reworded the Code, but did not
make any significant changes. I would just like to see the
Code followed.

Use the space below to provide feedback or suggestions about the proposed changes to
RTD's Code of Conduct and Respect the Ride.

134. I think it needs to be clarified to the public about how this
code of conduct will be enforced moving forward.

145. I don't see anything specific about non-destination riders.
Is that covered by not having a fare now?
146. You asked about a priority in a previous question. I suggest
you allow someone to choose more than one option.

136. The stations are dangerous and there needs to be a change
to homeless riding buses and rails all day. Sleeping in the
elevators should not be ok.

138. PLEASE remove the drug addicted homeless I do NOT feel
SAFE!!!
139. Looks good to me!
140. The changes are reasonable and make sense; however, the
wording is overly convoluted and hard to understand in
many of the revisions

142. I was using the train until two weeks ago. Given the train
and platforms/station is not that clean, that there have
been people using drugs/alcohol, etc., I have decided I
rather pay for parking, gas, and maintenance most of the
time now.
I think that the new PD head has great plans
and maybe I will try again after the PD has ramped up.

143. Having an updated Code of Conduct is good, but there has
to be enforcement, otherwise it won't make any difference
in perception or increase in ridership.

EMPLOYEES

141. Fares should be free. The free ride month in August saw an
increase in ridership with no adverse impacts to quality of
service.

COMMUNITY MEMBERS

137. Could we get more security devices and increased security
personnel presence in stations to where my life doesn't feel
endangered or threatened by those of whom aren't
supposed to be there?

CUSTOMERS

135. It was best said RTD is a transportation company built to
move people and not house them. While RTD services are
interagural part of solving crisis, and they solve it by
moving people to get help, get to work, or get home.
Without setting a precedent to a clean, safe, and reliable
transit system by enacting a strong code of conduct does a
disservice to RTD patrons, and the communities within
RTD. It has been clear those who cause the most issues
within RTD do not seek help from those who oppose
stricter changes to RTD code of conduct. And those who
oppose stricter changes only seek the benefit of passing the
problem along to a agency not fully suited to solve a crisis
alone. Enacting a stronger code of conduct shall help push
a ongoing community/culture crisis to a solution. One that
RTD can assist by safely and reliably transporting people.

144. There are no signs (or at least no obvious) that state that
food/drinks are not allowed on trains. If it is to be enforced,
then clear and legible signage must be placed on vehicles.

RECOMMENDED REVISIONS AND AMENDMENTS
SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON

3

In 2016, RTD’s Board of Directors approved the agency’s first-ever comprehensive list of rules and prohibited conduct on the transit
system. In 2020, amendments to the Customer Code of Conduct were drafted and approved for implementation. Following an internal
staff review that began in 2022, additional revisions were identified and are now being proposed to the community for consideration.
The latest round of revisions simplifies the existing guidelines and emphasizes respect for other customers, RTD’s
vehicles, facilities, and employees.

02

The table below outlines recommended revisions and amendments to RTD’s current Customer Code of Conduct. All feedback received
during the two-month outreach and engagement process will be compiled and shared with RTD’s Board of Directors prior to their June
meeting cycle. Feedback will be incorporated into a recommended action for the Board’s consideration. More information is available
online at rtd-denver.com/respect the ride.

Other Transit Agency Examples
•

In 2021, Palm Tran (Palm Beach County), debuted the world’s first “Progress Pride” bus, which
was wrapped in the Progress Flag. The Progress Pride flag was developed in 2018 by non-binary
American artist and designer Daniel Quasar (xe/xyr). The “Progress Flag” is based on the iconic
Rainbow flag, but incorporates black, brown, pink, and light blue to call for a more inclusive
society.

In 2020, King County Metro hosted “Ride With Pride Bingo” online and created a YouTube “Ride
with Pride” during a time when Pride events worldwide were cancelled due to the COVID-19
pandemic. King County Metro also created a “Ride With Pride” wrapped bus. The 2020 video is
found online:

•

Transit agency Pride celebrations have also commenced in D.C., London, New York, Dublin,
Sydney (since 2014), Chicago, and many more.

•

Many transit agencies also participate in local Pride parades and activities alongside other
governmental partners and community organizations. Some transit agency HR departments
include Pride month in internal Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

The Inclusion of Two-Spirit Identities
For this Resolution, a conscious decision was made to include Two-Spirit people. Two-Spirit is a term
used by some Indigenous people who express their sexual or gender identity as different from others.
Not all LGBTQIA persons who are indigenous will identify as Two Spirit, but all Two Spirit people are
indigenous. This term does not diminish the tribal-specific names, roles and traditions that indigenous
nations have for their own Two Spirit people.
It is important to note that this concept long predates the western LGBTQIA+ movement and does not
follow a Western binary. The Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies produced a helpful video on
their website to further educate the public about Two-Spirit identities:

DISCUSSION
By adopting this recommended action, the RTD Board of Directors proclaims June 28th as Ride with Pride
Day in recognition of the District’s LGBTQIA2S+ community and its collective contributions and
importance to the District. The Board further directs the administration to develop a plan to recognize
and celebrate Ride with Pride and other relate Pride month initiatives.
Strategic Plan Alignment
•

Community Value; Customer Excellence - RTD strives to be a strong community partner,
providing value to customers as well as to the broader Denver metro region. The creation of an
annual Ride With Pride Day will help RTD enhance its agency approach to reach diverse
audiences. It will also further advance the RTD brand through a meaningful and collaborative

approach as we continue to demonstrate our value through effective communications.
•

Employee Ownership - This Resolution directs employees to develop a vision for an annual
celebration. By avoiding a narrow scope or set of projects the Board would like to see, the
Resolution appropriately empowers staff to think creatively, work collaboratively, and
demonstrate ownership and pride in leading this initiative.
