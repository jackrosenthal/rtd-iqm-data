Director Catlin. Here. Director Davidson. Where?
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Director De Shell, excused. I am Director Geysinger. I am here, Director

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
President. Director Harwick. Here. Dr.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Present.
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Rosenthal. Director Rusha.

Not yet. Director Sloan here, Director Tisale. Director Whitmore present
and Director Williams.
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Okay, so we have. Let's see. 12 present and 3 absent. At this point.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Is that right? Yeah. All right. We have a quorum.
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Before we begin this evening, not that we would have to have a quorum, I
guess, but we do.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Before we begin this evening, I'd like to outline the purpose for
tonight's discussion. It's a study session.
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We don't take any votes. It's intended to look at some of the issues
around our governance and and some things we've talked about in terms of
our bylaws and operating guidelines and some things like that.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
No formal action is taken. It's really intended to inform the development
of future recommended actions and discussion items.
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So it'll help us. Hone in on some of those things. We've set the schedule
with times attached.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We're going to try to stick to those. I'm not going to be unreasonable if
we have a good conversation going we may go longer but we're going to try
to stay with a the times that are written.
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So be concise. Assume positive intent. And let's not let the perfect be
the enemy of the good.
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We act as a board. I appreciate Jack helping me with some of this. As we
have a lot to cover tonight, I'm going to try to keep things moving.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So we have a PowerPoint. It really is just background. We're not going to
spend time on the PowerPoint, but it has language for the bylaws.
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Some of those things so any questions before we jump in All right, great.
Our first topic for discussion this evening is around the board bylaws
and committee structure.
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We have several topics. And Secretary Sloan, I have asked to kick off the
first conversation because she is as someone said the one who has tilted
at windmills on this topic for some time.
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000

It is on informal meetings for 3 or more directors. Dr. Sloan, if you
would take that over, please.
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Hi would be happy. I would be happy to and to me it's more like Groundhog
Day for all of us to be looking at this.
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But I believe this proposal for informal meetings of 3 or more directors.
Would really be helpful. To the board and we're in a study session and
our topic is studying ourselves and I think this is an important thing.
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:06.000
To look at. The informal meetings proposal is transparent. For the public
because it gives notice to the public.
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And an opportunity to attend it's informal so you know we will not you
know, unless someone wants to set up themselves, all the accooterments of
our meetings in the boardroom.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But the public would have notice of the topic and the time and there
would be. A record.
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Not. Youtube record of the meeting. Necessarily, although potentially it
could be.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And. That's great for the public, but I think it's also great for the
board because we can learn what topics are interesting.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:03.000
To, you know, a sub group. Of the board and You at least get a heads up
that that's going to come up or maybe it's something you're interested in
contributing to.
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So a board member. Would have notice just like the public would and have
an opportunity to shape. That any proposal that would come out of the
informal meetings.
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It's efficient because right now Only 2 people can discuss public
business. But our bylaws require 3 people.
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Propose an agenda item. And under those circumstances you end up. With a
game of telephone. Or I guess now it could be a game of email or texting,
which might be fun for a while, but things.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:01.000

Lose coherence if there's not an accurate check. Of every communication
and you don't get the communication that you would have.
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:16.000
You know, person to person at a meeting. And finally, it's. In
compliance, the proposal is in compliance with both the letter and
spirit.
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Of the Open Meetings Act. The daisy chains. Of communication that are now
really the only way 3 people can propose an agenda item.
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Have been questioned in court rooms. There's no
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:49.000
No true applicable decision now that certainly there has been a lot of.
Objecting to him. So.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I would propose that we would allow these informal meetings. It would
require an amendment. Of our bylaws and I am.
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Continue to be firmly. Of the belief that this would aid the operation of
the board.
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Thank you very much. I think you can see the language. That is proposed
for the bylaw change.
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Is it would it be helpful to anyone to read that?
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Wanna read that real quickly? Drive Sloan. Well, in formal meetings may
be called to engage in discussions of public business by 3 or more
directors.
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:43.000
The purposes of such meetings may include discussion of a matter to bring
to the board relationships with stakeholders and constituents.
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Who would this is not within the language who would perhaps participate
in the meeting. Or other matters related to agency business.
00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:05.000
No formal action may be taken. The directors calling the meeting may set
the location and agenda as appropriate. To the topic of the meeting.
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Written minutes shall be recorded.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And there's a subsection also to be added. The scheduling directors must
provide the meeting agenda.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Including any materials, time and location. Of the meeting to the
executive manager of the board office and the board chair at least 48 h
prior to the meeting.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Thank you. Thank you.
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Any discussion on this item? Let's see. It's not showing up. Down here, I
guess, direct the broom.
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Thank you, Chair. I was, I guess maybe I need a. Illegal.
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Opinion on this but I was under the impression that There was a state
sunshine law and it specifically provided for 2 and that, It was really
your only choice.
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
How do we get around that? And maybe there is an estate sunshine law in
Colorado and I'm.
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Thinking back to Florida or Illinois. Well I'll jump in and then we can
ask our legal counsel to do it.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:33.000
But this is written to comply with the open meetings law, which is the
state sunshine law. So it's written to provide that notice is given as
required by the Open Meetings Law that the agenda is provided and all of
the information is put out public.
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So it basically is a public meeting if anybody wants to attend. Miss
Snyder, do you want to address that?
00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Really?
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. This is Melanie Schneider, General Counsel.
You did cover that correctly and Director Broom, you're correct.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Once it's more than 2 directors, then the open meetings law applies. So
that the way that this proposal is framed is if it's 3 directors or more
there would have to be notice consistent with the open meetings law.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Notice of the meeting, 24 h in advance and an identification of the
topics to be discussed as well as the opportunity for the public to be
present.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Thank you. Thank you. And Dr. Bouquet.
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Yes, thank you very much. And, Thank you very much, Secretary Sloan, for
bringing this up.
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I know I have voiced some concerns in the past. So I just wanted I just
had a couple questions and my first one is, are there any comparable
publicly elected boards that do this process already?
00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:11.000
That is a great question and I don't know the answer to it. You know, I
know there are several city councils that have subcommittees perhaps with
more than 2, so they must have some provisions.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:23.000
In their city charter or their bylaws. Okay. I have not researched. Yeah,
I think that might not be the worst thing to look into just to see if
there's other boards you can We make ultimately if it's going well or
successful.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:32.000
So then just a couple questions. So keeping minutes, I'm assuming it'd be
one of the 3 directors would keep minutes then.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Based on this proposal because it looks like staff wouldn't need to be
present. Correct. I think again that's why it's informal and it would be
easy to just appoint one of the organizers.
00:11:48.000 --> 00:12:03.000
To prepare minutes. Which you know in the minutes of the board are not
really that detailed, but this also would comply with a lot of minutes or
taken.
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Would this just apply for in person meetings or with Zoom Meetings? Be a
factor or has it been considered?
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:23.000
All of this is subject to. Councils. Opinion but it seems to me Zoom
Meetings you know with made the definition of a meeting.
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So it a telephone conference call. Okay. And then I guess, I guess my
ultimate concerns would be, again, Just regarding accessibility to the
public.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I think it's. I think I appreciate the spirit behind it ultimately. I
just have a lot of concerns when it comes down to public accessibility,
because it looks like in the spirit behind it.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Ultimately, I just have a lot of concerns when it comes down to public
accessibility, because it looks like in the language, the director of
calling medi may set the location and agenda.
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I know we went into. Just a conversation about like what location
ultimately looks like and how manageable and feasible it is so I think
that would just be something to consider.
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I would look into the research if other boards that are publicly elected
are publicly elected that are doing this. Again, I have a lot of
hesitancy.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
My full-time job is working at Douglas County School District, which
again this isn't comparable but.
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Going to it ultimately where they basically got a slap on the risk that
school board for doing daisy chain communication that ultimately led to
the hiring and firing of their equivalent of their CEO, which is the
superintendent.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I guess that would be ultimately I concerns and maybe just kind of
looking into a little bit more research into are there other boards that
are comparable to this?
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Is it being successful? And then looking at the overall accessibility
when it comes to the actual public actually having a say.
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So right now I'm just a little bit hesitant going forward with it. So if
you were to ask me.
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I obviously this isn't a vote but I'm not a hundred percent comfortable
but I appreciate the effort and I appreciate the spirit though, so thank
you.
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Thank you, Director Bouquet, Director. This is Dale. Thank you very much,
Madam Chair.
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:10.000

I think it would help to put this in context. The reason we're talking
about a bylaw change to affectuate what is being called informal director
meetings.
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Is that the bylaws currently constrain us only to certain types of
meetings that are held. And it specifically talks about the regular board
meeting, the annual meeting, the committee meetings, and so on.
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:42.000
If we were to have something else, we have to amend the bylaws to allow
something else. And I think that there is merit to the consideration of
something else.
00:14:42.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Provided that what is being done which is what is proposed is to give
everyone fair notice. Relative to the district court opinion concerning
the Douglas County School District and their daisy chain meetings.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I take issue with the court's conclusion in that. I think what they did
was perfectly proper.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And this would be a way to say even though that may be proper and you can
do it. We want to be more open.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:27.000
We want to be more transparent. So, for example, 3 directors say, I'd
like to talk about this particular issue and bring it up.
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:38.000
How do they do it? They either daisy chain, which I think is perfectly
legal. But a Douglas County District Judge disagrees with that conclusion
or we have to do something like this.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I think it's worth exploring. I think it's worth bringing forward and I
think that any interest of the public.
00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Is more than adequately. Protected by virtue of the mechanics that are
being described in the proposed bylaw that we are studying, not acting
upon, studying tonight.
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Thank you. Thank you, Director Cuzdale, and Director Guzman.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I'm just curious. In the language that's presented here, it refers to
Article 4, Section 4.
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:27.000

Saying that the proposed bylaw amendments would need to add a new article
and if that is just an error meaning that's supposed to say article 4,
section 6.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Cause it would be misplaced, I believe. Under the current bylaws. If we
put it in 4?
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
If I may, Director Grasman, I took this directly from the previous board
report on this and I think the red line.
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I took this directly from the previous board report on this and I think
that previous board report on this and I think that that previous board
report contained a red line draft of the proposed changes which had it
inserted as a section 4.
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Why that section was chosen I don revisit that. Just that section 6 under
our current bylaws is there.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Publicly displayed is public meetings and executive sessions which has a
section A and a section B and no section C.
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:16.000
But section 4 refers to the. Annual board planning meeting. And so I'm
just thinking, that's an issue. Okay.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Yeah, well taken. Anything else? No. Okay, Director Catlin.
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Dr. Sloan, for bringing this
forward. Like the idea and I concur with her assessment that this would
create more efficiencies for the board.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And I also think that in. You know, maybe brainstorming some of these
issues. That directors could also brainstorm some of the questions that
could be posed and perhaps.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Streamline the amount of time that would be required of staff to address
some of these issues. I just think that it could provide more efficiency.
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Whitmore. This is probably a strange question
for a legal counsel, but we speak about daisy chaining.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:22.000

Would this allow or could we craft an amendment to this proposed
amendment to where You could have correspondence via email between 3
board members as opposed to just 2.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Just a thought because that's one of those. Hindrances When you have 3
people trying to bring forth a item for an agenda.
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000
I know just a thought. Again, I'll opine on this real quick and then turn
it over to our real attorney here.
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Yeah, kind of. I don't practice anymore, but I think the problem with
that is, I think the problem with that is, are you complying with the
open meetings law.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I think the problem with that is, I think the problem with that is, you
know, are you complying with the open meetings law?
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And if, you know, Director but I don't know that anything about that
daisy chain.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I don't know that we could make that more public that make it would
comply if a judge were to say no.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Okay, Miss Schneider, I'm not a real opinion. Yes, thank you, Madam
Chair.
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And the short answer is you're correct. I mean, meetings under the open
meetings are described as not just in person meetings, but telephone
conversations, text messages, Zoom Meetings, and emails are also included
within the definition.
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000
So whether it's an in-person meeting or an email chain. You're going to
still have to follow the same notice requirements.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Thank you, Dr. Davidson.
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Secretary Sloan, for
bringing this forward again.
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
I appreciate it. Sloane for bringing this forward again. I appreciate it.
You know, I think I'd just like to point out, you know, I think I'd just
like to point out, Dr.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:20:02.000
McKay, thank you for the concerns. I understand those definitely. I think
the main thing that comes to mind for me is still it came to my mind last
year, which is the formation of board initiated recommended actions and
requiring you know, requiring 3 directors to bring those forward.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And I think this is definitely falls in the category. I know we're going
to revisit smaller committees tonight of we can test this, we can try
this and we can revisit this.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And I would suspect and even hope that one of the ways this would be
utilized would be when we bring forward a board initiated recommended
action.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:32.000
That's always been a question in my mind as a director is how to make
that happen. Sometimes those will emerge out of a committee discussion,
but I think this allows for those types of discussions to happen outside
the committee discussion.
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
But I think this allows for those types of discussions to happen outside
the construct of a committee, which I agree with, for those types of
discussions to happen outside the construct of a committee, which I agree
with Dr.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Guysinger's point, or I'm sorry, Dr. Kalin's point, that that may
actually contribute to some efficiencies.
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:54.000
I did want to just take a moment and ask General Counsel Snyder if you
have any major risks that we haven't talked about so far that you foresee
with this or any concerns that you might want to weigh in on at this
time.
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Thank you, Director Davidson. You know, I think from open and open
meetings perspective, we have covered our bases, presuming that we are
actually going to comply with what we're proposing.
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
So we want to make sure we do that. The proposal also does also highlight
that there would be compliance with ADA.
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Requirements and accessibility requirements. So those are all things that
are operationally you just need to make sure we actually adhere to what
we say we're going to do.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000

But as proposed, I think there's a way to comply with it within the law.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And so I would just say the directors and the board office. I mean, this
is, I think this is worth trying.
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:42.000
I think this would be helpful, especially for those recommended actions.
If we have a challenge with it, you know, look to the board office if
we're struggling to come up with all of the accessibility and everything
that would be required and working with the SAS.
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Let's talk about it. All of the accessibility and everything that would
be required and working with us on us. Let's talk about it.
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Let's bring it put it in the category of prototype, try it and revisit if
it doesn't work.
00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Thanks. Thank you. I will note that Director Rusha has joined us. And I'm
told that there's a raised hand on Zoom, the director of music.
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
I can't see the raised hands. Oh there it is. Check your music, go ahead.
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Thank you, Madam Chair. And Director Sloan, thank you again for bringing
this forward. Thank you for your tenacity and once again I agree that
this is an appropriate item for us to consider.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:30.000
You know, I think that one of the bigger things, at least from where I
am, is it would allow directors in a kind of a similar area to target.
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:41.000
An audience for example Director Davidson, Director Whitmore, and I each
share portions of the city of Thornton.
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And it'll be really nice for the 3 of us to get together with Thornton to
talk about issues they're having as it relates to RTD and this would be
the perfect mechanism for us.
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:58.000
So for that and for other reasons that have already been discussed, I
would be in favor of supporting something like this.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And Director Tisale, you are absolutely in favor of supporting something
like this. And Director Tisale, you are absolutely right.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Thank you, Director Music. Director Sloan, Secretary Sloan. Thank you
all. If director, I would just like to add that if Director Guzman is
correct and The group got the wrong section number rather than the
correct one.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
If we could have all been together instead of emailing each other, it
might have been a much better product.
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:34.000
So thank you.
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Great. I don't see any other hands. I would agree with with what director
Davidson said that the let's give this a try i think that you know the
caucuses in the legislature got in trouble this year for kind of a gray
area and they've agreed not to have the meetings that they were having
kind of a gray area and they've agreed not to have the meetings that they
were having before.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
It seems to me like creating a process whereby we know we are having the
meetings that they were having before.
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
It seems to me like creating a process whereby we know we are complying
with the open meetings law and other laws just protects us.
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
You know, we don't have to worry about whatever daisy chain is is okay or
not.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Director Guzman. Thank you. 2 thoughts that I'm having right now.
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.000
One, I appreciate that you left in the opportunity to use the RTD spaces.
For these meetings.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:30.000
I'm not technically savvy. I didn't have the two-year break from my work
to learn how to do all of the crazy things on Zoom that are available.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.000
So I do rely on other people for that ability. So the IT expertise would
be really helpful in some of those instances I can imagine.
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:48.000
But I do wanna, maybe ask the GM CEO to weigh in just a little bit about
what that is or do we have to ask for mission somehow?
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000

What's the process? If we need a conference room, for example. How would
we do that?
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000
And I don't know what that process looks like because it's something I've
never done.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
So any direction anybody, I don't know. Sounds like you're asking a
question for our GM CEO.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
I think go ahead. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, Deborah Johnson,
General Mandarin CEO, and if I may proceed with response, Director
Guzman, thank you very much for the question.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:35.000
I believe what would be most prudent if one was interested in utilizing
RTD own facilities would be to coordinate through the board office and
they could provide that support more so if we're looking for any
technological support, utilizing virtual platforms, that too would be
coordinated through board office staff, recognizing that other staff
within the organization that is under my auspices, we are here to support
the board and the
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:43.000
overarching elements of the regional transportation district. So we would
make ourselves available contingent upon notification and staff resources
and availability.
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Thank you very kindly for the opportunity to address. Thank you. Anything
else, Dr. Kuzwin?
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:59.000
OK, I think I can take just sort of a thumbs up. Sort of a indication for
moving this forward to the executive committee and further.
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Thumbs up, thumbs. Let's see. Madam Chair. Sorry.
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:13.000
That wasn't recognized. We will formally vote on this though as a board.
Perfect. And it will take 10 votes, so.
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Thank you very much. I'm already off the time schedule, but these first 2
topics are sort of the, medias because our bylaws changes.
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:34.000
So I am okay with that. Our next topic is around a proposed bylaw change
to limit the length of our meetings with the ability to.
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:42.000

Extend that. And I've asked Vice Chair Catlin to please kick off this
conversation.
00:26:42.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Thanks, Madam Chair. At the July executive committee meeting, we
discussed the merits of setting limit or fixed end time on board meetings
and and I would actually kind of amend that to say guidelines for, yeah,
board meetings, just not hard, fast limits, but just some guidelines.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:13.000
So there really was a consensus that it was worth further exploration.
And so our board office did some really good research on what other.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Boards and governmental agencies do to limit Links of board meetings.
And. We're proposing a bylaw change.
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:42.000
At the end it was proposed at the end of the September executive
committee meeting. And we received feedback from a number of board
members and a revised proposed bylaw change was circulated to the full
board.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Now we're looking at it in this study session to really gain additional
input and to discuss it. So the goal tonight is to get input on the
proposed language for a bylaw change to limit or to provide guidelines
limiting the length of board meetings.
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Unless there is significant objection, it is anticipated that a formal
change would be brought forward in November. So just some of the history
and I really want to thank the board office for compiling this data,
these data.
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:24.000
There were 3. The operations and safety committee meeting on March
eighth. That was 4 h and 24 min.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:35.000
The full board meeting on April 20 fifth. That was 5 h and 19 min. A full
board meeting on June 20 seventh, which was 5 h and 49 min.
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000
There were 2 additional board meetings that exceeded 3 and a half hours.
The full board meeting on February 20 eighth that was nearly 4 h long
just 5 min shy.
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And the full board meeting on March, the 20 eighth which was just a
little over 3 and a half hours.
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:59.000

So the average length of a full board meeting is 3 and a half hours,
which is quite a bit of time.
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And I do remember in years past there were some. Meetings that even
exceeded the 5 h mark and there were a couple of them that.
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Hmm, went on until midnight, 11 o'clock or midnight. So. I think
everybody.
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:27.000
That I've talked to has agreed that after a certain Time. Has been
expelled. You You lose focus and you lose a little energy.
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And so that's my personal opinion. I'm going to go ahead and read the
proposed bylaw change.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Add the following language to Article 4, Prin Meetings, Section 8,
Princesses and Adjournments.
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Once 4 h have elapsed following the call to order of a meeting all
regular special and committee meetings of the board of directors shall be
adjourned at the conclusion of the agenda item under consideration.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Unless the board votes to extend the meetings length. A meeting may be
extended by a majority vote of present and voting members.
00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:11.000
The motion to extend a meeting may or may not state a time when the board
meeting will conclude. If such a time is set, a motion may be made in a
majority of the board may pass an additional motion to extend.
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Any remaining action and discussion items on the agenda at the time of
adjournment will automatically carry forward to the next meeting of the
board or respective committee.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Or to a time set by a majority of the board. I wanted to add just a
couple of comments here.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:38.000
It, it really is the, responsibility of the board member conducting a
meeting to manage the time.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:49.000
And I think that at any point within the meeting, it would be. Good to do
a time check and to ask.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Other board members for for their Consideration of either. That's
planning a topic or.
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Limiting the discussion of the topic. And I think that that we have done
that on some occasions and some of the meetings and it's been fairly
effective.
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000
But this also gives some. Good guidance for the chairs of those
committees or the chair of the board to.
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Enforce that. Thank you very much. Okay. Comments?
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Questions? With someone who has to wake up at 5 30 in the morning to
teach and then teaches till 3 and then coaches till 5 and then tries to
make a board being at 5 30.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
I'm all in favor of this. But I just had a couple just questions
regarding it. We obviously, I just want to make a kind of public record.
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Just time sensitive items, I guess, because sometimes we have to vote on
contracts ultimately and say, hey, like our next board meeting will be
after.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000
I'm just curious how that will kind of impact our schedule, I guess would
be the big thing is, hey, do those items move up forward?
00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:04.000
I guess the other thing is we start our meetings with public comment for
our board meetings and then, we start our meetings with public comment
for our board meetings and then, you know, I, I haven't experienced this
yet.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:24.000
But I've seen plenty of school board meetings where public comments can
go for hours. So I am curious if there has been a consideration of in
theory do we cut off at a point of when it comes down to public comment
if it's going to, impact the ultimate timeline of the board meeting,
which I'm not in favor of.
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:37.000
I want the public to obviously have a voice. So I guess those would just
be my 2 consideration as time sensitive matters that we'd have to
ultimately vote on, how would that impact our schedule, and then also
public comment that's going.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000

Past it has that and been in consideration. So thank you.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:55.000
I think those are very good questions. I think the first one it would be
easy for the chair to be working with our staff to say what needs to
happen tonight, you know, if it start looking that way.
00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:17.000
And the second one, you know, if we have something that raises that much.
Public, you know, it's probably worth sticking around and, so that's why
we drafted in, you know, the ability to extend it and either extend it to
extend it and either extend it to the ability to extend it and either
extend it to a time and then extend it and either extend it to a time and
then extend it to a time and then extend it again or just say we're going
to finish everything we're doing
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:40.000
tonight. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, for recognizing me. I would
just like to offer up the intent and having pre meetings with those
committee tiers is to outline what comes before you all and quite
naturally if in fact there is something that's time critical that would
be assessed and the more specifically as the carnage into stands,
recommended action items go first.
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:51.000
And from a staff perspective, we work in tandem recognizing that there's
recurring contractual obligations that may need to come before this body
for action.
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000
So all of that would be addressed if everybody's in alignment in doing
what we're intended to do for the betterment of the people that we serve.
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Thank you. Thank you, Miss Johnson, Mr. Whitmore, Director Whitmark. I'm
sorry, were you done?
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Okay. So in my 5 years, I think we've had. At least 3 meetings where we
began on one day and ended on the next.
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:26.000
And that's not a good thing. So I appreciate the spirit of limiting to
around 4 h in regard to the prioritization, if we run up against
something that has to happen.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Then we have the flexibility to extend for a half hour or an hour to make
sure that we do the business that needs to be done.
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:42.000
For you know our constituents sake so I think this makes some sense and I
appreciate it and no more meetings that start on one day and end on the
next please.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Thank you, Director Cuzdale. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Just in
support of what's already been said.
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Remember that all this does is give us the power to control our own
destiny. And if we say, OK, this must be addressed tonight and if we need
to extend, we'll extend.
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:18.000
It will also serve, I believe, to help keep us on task. We have not often
had to do this, but I remember at least in one or 2 meetings where I've
had to call for the orders of the day.
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:27.000
And that simply is a parliamentary expression for saying, can we go back
to the agenda, please, and recognize we're talking about X and not about
A, B, and C.
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
And if we do that and keep ourselves focused, we'll do fine. I think it's
a reasonable rule.
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:50.000
It has lots of flexibility and relative to public comment. There have
only been In my 7 years on the board there have only been 2 Public
comment sessions that went for more than like 30 min or so.
00:35:50.000 --> 00:36:04.000
So it's not something that we are routinely. Pestered with. I think the
public is always very focused and I love it particularly when our
employees and the operators come and talk to us.
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:17.000
But even in the most. Volatile of circumstances one time when we were
taken over by a group of protesters and had some 45 wheelchairs in this
room.
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:25.000
We still got through all of that in about 40 min. And everybody had their
speak. Thank you. Thank you.
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:33.000
I would notice that Director Williams has joined us online. I do not see
any hands for anyone online or anyone else here.
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:42.000
I would just say, you know, if there, if anyone has interest concerns
with actual language, the word smithing.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
To please, you know, we have not gotten this down the road. It'll go to
the executive committee.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:55.000
It'll go to the board. But it's still at a time where you could get back
to our board office or to me and we could take a look at any concerns.
00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Anybody could I? Get a thumbs up here. General support.
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Okay, thanks. Alright. Did I see? Is there a hand?
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Okay. Okay. Now we have a couple of items that, Our executive manager.
Kroll will handle for us.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.000
The first one is the bylaws and board document review, intended to
byline. Tentative timeline.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Great. Thank you so much, Chair Geysinger, and this is Jack Kroll for the
record, executive manager of the board office.
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:54.000
You know, one of the things that I know in my short time here is that the
board has done a tremendous amount of work on its bylaws recently,
particularly as it relates to meetings and committees and there were some
revisions to the officer elections and the various powers of the
executive committee and the chair of the board.
00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.000
But as you read through the rest of that document, there's a lot of love
that can be given to it in other places.
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:17.000
There's a lot of love that can be given to it in other places. One of the
things that I think will be a halt can be a hallmark for good governance
is not just reviewing it when the need arises, but setting everything on
a schedule and a plan to be reviewed over a certain set timeframe.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:26.000
3 years is the rule of thumb that I'm using. So as we go through this
process and I'll show you in a moment here, kind of the timeline, rough
timeline.
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:37.000
It's nothing that you're being asked to approve or this is just my sense
of when we might be able to bring this through the board and it might
have to be adjusted with some of the other changes that are coming
forward.
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:49.000

But generally speaking, we want to make sure that we're setting a
consistent review of our policies or your policies rather and that
nothing gets left by the wayside for too long.
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Nothing in that timeline in that cadence, however, will ever preclude the
board from revisiting something on a more expeditious schedule.
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:08.000
So generally speaking, this is the process here that I'm proposing to
review by law changes that I'm proposing to review by law changes.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:32.000
So the board office would work in consultation with senior leadership
team to propose any changes. Later that month, the full board would
review discuss and offer feedback.
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Then that feedback would be reincorporated into the potential change in
the policy or the bylaw before coming back as a recommended action and
following the same steps.
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:53.000
There's a few things to note here. Bylaws require 10. Votes to be changed
as the chair referenced earlier.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:04.000
The additional thing is that bylaw changes also have to, there has to be
a notice according to the current bylaws of an impending change 10 days
in advance.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:17.000
That should align. With when we published the Executive Committee Agenda.
So when that packet goes out, that's typically been 10 days in advance.
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
If for whatever reason that's not the case, we'll make sure the board
office gets it out.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:29.000
But effectively that's That's the process. This is a rough timeline here.
I've broken down each.
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Section of the bylaws sort of assessed how wavy those bylaws are made
some notes here of when the last known updates were.
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:47.000
2 additional items beyond the bylaws you'll note there at the bottom
we're bringing the expensive reimbursement policy through for an update.
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
That will go for discussion at next week's board meeting and then come
back as a recommended action in November.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:01.000
The agency also did some significant work to update its record retention
policy. This is not necessarily a policy that the board has.
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Typically approved in the past. But there are a lot of board documents
that you all have. Going back to 19 seventys and.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:23.000
And the eighties and you know, I'm going to work with, the general
counsel's team and the appropriate staff there to kind of bring forward a
recommendation on what our retention schedule ought to be for some of
these documents.
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And we can go into more detail on that when that comes forward. But it's
an area of risk, frankly, to have so many documents still here because if
we received a core request for them.
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Well, Tai Shray, Gillian Marie and I might have to take a trip out
somewhere.
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Go dust off some old boxes, not to be flippant about it, but the policy
has been basically keep everything for all time and that might not be the
best approach.
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
So with that. I'm happy to. Any questions or concerns?
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Thank you, Mr. Cole.
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:11.000
And thank you for bringing that forward. I think it's a great to be
getting the bylaws on a regular review schedule, Director Chisel.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Thank you very much. I was just going to ask if we could get copies of
those materials because they weren't in the board packet.
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:31.000
And it it's all great work and I'm very much in favor of doing this on a
regular basis We from time to time have said, oh, we need to look at this
and we do it, but it's more ad-hoc.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And I think a structured approach is wonderful. I would like to make sure
we all get copies of that.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Thank you. Great. See any hands online? Anybody else?

00:42:44.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Great. We're catching up. The next topic is also for. Mr. Crowe, to talk
about, They process for developing annual committee work plans, which is
also something that he has.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Brought to the board. Great. Thank you, Chair. Annual committee work
plans on their most basic function is just agreed upon outline for the
timing of the work that a committee is to complete.
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Basically an outline that the committee and the full board kind of agrees
to at the beginning of the year for the planned discussion items and the
planned action items to come through any given committee.
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:49.000
This is really important to do. There's oftentimes issues that come up
from board members that May warrant a response, but that has to fit
within the context of everything else that the administration is planning
to bring forward to and to get the best response it ought to be something
that fits in the broader scheme of a work plan.
00:43:49.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Here's just kind of the general process. This is not set in stone. This
is something that I think could work well and depending on how your
conversation on this goes tonight, depending on how your conversation on
this goes tonight, we can take and incorporate additional feedback and
bring back something for your conversation on this goes tonight, we can
take and incorporate additional feedback and bring back something for
your consideration in November.
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.000
But in effect, in your January meeting, you're going to elect chairs and
vice chairs of your committees.
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Then my vision for this would be that the chair and the vice chair of
those committees meet with the senior leadership team members that staff
those committees.
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Those senior leadership team members will have a good sense of what they
need to bring forward as a staff over the course of the year, whether
that's a contract, whether that's a service change, etc.
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:50.000
And they can outline all of that. Then based on the feedback that the
chair and the vice chair are getting from their committee members on
issues that may be of significant importance, certain topics that the
board wants to discuss and consider in addition to those can be
incorporated into a draft work plan that is then circulated amongst
committee members.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000
It receives discussion at the February board meeting, our committee and
board meeting, and then comes back in the subsequent month in March for
approval.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:09.000
And you're sort of all committing to this plan for the year. And then a
good plan should leave space for when things arise.
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:17.000
You know, you can fit that in. The other item I would add here is if you
create, if the chair creates.
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Or continues to have a certain ad hoc committee, that ad hoc committee
should have a work plan for a given year as well.
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
And with that, I've introduced the idea and I'll yield it back all to you
for discussion.
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Great. I'm reminded of Dwight Eisenhower's quote when he said, planning
is everything and plans are nothing.
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
And I don't think plans are nothing, but I do think it's important that
these plans as you were outlining are flexible.
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
You know, we're not going to expect staff to have everything ready to go
for the year ahead.
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:54.000
But they'll know when the budget's coming and things like that. And
obviously there'll be things that will come up with the committee.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.000
So just to just to point that out and Director Catlin. Thank you, Madam
Chair, and and thank you, Mr. Cole.
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000
I really am in support of this wholeheartedly. But I have just a couple
suggestions.
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:21.000
One would be that prior to the beginning of 2024 when we will be
selecting executive committee you know, chair and then chairs of the
respective committees.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:35.000
That it might be helpful to have a. Just a template for a work plan so
that if somebody is interested in cheering a committee, they will know
kind of what is expected of them.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
One of my suggestions. Just number one, a template and number 2. Just
kind of an outline.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Also an outline of staff's work plan. That the committee will have to
address over time. Thank you.
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Thank you. And Dr. Davidson, if you don't mind, Ms. Johnson, do you see
any?
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Problem with this any. For the staff is supportive. Of this process.
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Thank you, Madam Chair, for the question. I believe it would be helpful.
Recognizing the board's responsibility relative to approving a budget,
you know, there are certain elements that go hand in hand with that and
recognizing, as I said in my previous comments, relative to the
coordination and understanding the partnership in which leadership team
members have, as well as I have with my role in coordinating with the
executive committee and
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:45.000
what we currently have as the performance committee. I think it is a step
in the right direction to manage all expectations and then more so have
an understanding of what might be feasible.
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:58.000
I believe more so this will be quite helpful when this body can be in the
sense of having a retreat, recognizing that there are some critical
elements that are important, recognizing that there are some critical
elements that are important to this body.
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Having a work plan basically garners an understanding amongst all about
what the path forward will be. So at this juncture I would say no it
would be something Mr. Cole indicated that you know there be members of
the leadership team that coordinate with the committee chairs I would add
to that I would like to be involved because ultimately most of these
actions are authorizing me in my capacity at the GM and CEO to engage.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000
So that is just one addition I would like to put forward for your
consideration if this comes to fruition.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Thank you. Okay, we'll let you be involved.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:39.000
All right, I see Director Davidson and then after that, Director
Williams. Hi. Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:47.000
And Mr. Karl, thanks for putting this together and for bringing this
forward. I think this is a very good step in the right direction.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:56.000
And I thank you to the CEO and General Manager for noting the, retreat. I
think this is a useful tool for that.
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
We had a discussion at this pass for trade around priorities. And some of
those have informed some things we've tackled this year.
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.000
So I think this can become something we get into a rhythm of to improve
the quality of the outcome of the retreats.
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:23.000
And I'd also like to note that when it comes to ad hoc committees, the
audit committee ad hoc out at committee needed to go through a process
that had a project plan and had-hoc committees, the audit committee ad
hoc out at committee needed to go through a process that had a project
plan and had milestones and had things we had to go through a process
that had a project plan and had milestones and had things we had to
coordinate
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:32.000
with external contractors and had things we had to coordinate with
external contractors and staff members. I think my only question and and
had things we had to coordinate with external contractors and staff
members.
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.000
I think my only question and and this may be a little bit of a teaser of
a topic to come is when we have things that go over multiple years.
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
So the ad hoc audit committee had work over in the course of 2 years that
didn't fit tightly into 12 months.
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Same is true for I think some of the changes come into performance
committee. So I think maybe there's some just things we'll get used to
and find in the rhythm.
00:49:47.000 --> 00:50:00.000
But one thing I was also going to note on this is that this becomes a
great and I think an invaluable tool to future board members to future
committees as they change to have the previous year's work plan.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
And a lot will be boilerplate and we'll start to get a sense of how
things roll out.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:11.000
I'm thinking most about performance committee right now, where we seem to
just kind of be repeating things each year.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
And this can actually become a record to develop some consistency,
especially given that we are an elected board that turns over.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:22.000
So anyway, I guess that's a long-winded way of saying I think this is
great and thank you Mr. Cole.
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Thank you, Dr. Williams.
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000
I wanted to do the best I can. I have a multiple stitches. So if you
can't understand me.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Oh Okay.
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Let me know. I think it's a great idea. I think that it needs to include
the definition of what the.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:55.000
At the beginning of the. Layout of the plan. And to remind each committee
why they're there and what they're trying to do.
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:06.000
I think if that statement is made that all the rest of it is great and
will help us to move forward.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Thank you very much. I think that's very well taken. And as Director
Catlin just mentioned to me and also tied to our strategic goals, but it
sounds like we're generally supportive of this, and as Director Catlin
just mentioned to me and also tied to our strategic goals, but it sounds
like we're generally supportive of this Next item is feedback on our
smaller committees.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:33.000
We had a 2021 bylaw change that came from the work of an ad hoc committee
that was led by Director Tizdale and former director.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Now transportation commissioner Shelley Cook. And on the committee
structure, we reduced both the number of standing committees and the
number of board members on each committee and at the time there was a lot
of discussion that we would circle back and get some feedback.
00:51:43.000 --> 00:52:03.000

So that's what I'm doing here. Let's see how the change is working. I've
asked Director Tizdale to kick this off and Director Williams may well be
able to give us some feedback as our 2 committee chairs.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Just very briefly, if you look at
packet page 14, you'll see the historical note that we created back at
the time when we were talking about doing this change.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:32.000
And it was decided when we came up with the change that the board would
do a look back. To see if in fact this was functioning well.
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:51.000
One of the things that we were concerned about was Could we hopefully
help make board meetings shorter by having the committee meetings have a
full explication, exposure, if you will, of an idea.
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Through the committee members, but that all. All board members. Were
invited to attend and were entitled to speak at the committee meetings.
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:06.000
It's just that they didn't vote. And then the matter would come before
the full board.
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:17.000
I think we've done a pretty good job of making sure that we did not
succumb to what as I described in that historical note.
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Government by the elites. There was a concern because this is what
happened back when we went to committees of the whole in 2,007.
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Was there was this fear that Just the committee members were aware of
what was going on. The full board didn't really have any picture and so
they said well we'll fix that we'll make everything at committee as a
whole.
00:53:40.000 --> 00:54:00.000
That I think was a cumbersome conclusion and the state audit back in
2,010. Told us it was a cumbersome conclusion and about 10 years later we
said, okay, fine, we'll change it.
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:09.000
The mills of God grind exceeding slow, but they grind exceeding small. In
any event, we came up with this solution.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:19.000
My own view is that it has worked well and that no board member has been
isolated from the process at all.
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:25.000

With that said, we're looking for feedback at this point. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Thank you. Direct Williams. I see your hand is up. Can you?
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Okay. Yeah, similar. My comments are very similar to dogs that, director,
We, we have That is, we believe.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Hmm.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:58.000
From the committees that were. Broken out and that many times almost all
of the directors are out. I've been tearing the ops committee and a lot
of good stuff has happened there.
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:10.000
And it makes our overall board meetings. Well educated and better
informed. I think.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Thank you. Looking for other hands online, Director Whitmore.
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000
I'd just like to thank Director Tizdale and Commissioner Cook for their
hard work on this.
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Matter a year or 2 ago. After working in both situations, I think the
word cumbersome is appropriate from.
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Director Tizdale doing it the old way. I have found a committee meetings
far more productive. With the smaller.
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Committees, it seems like we get more accomplished, have better
discussions. And the fact that anybody can, anybody on the board, well
anybody can attend.
00:55:51.000 --> 00:56:01.000
And comment, I think, is. The stroke a genius on on how to do that so I'm
all in favor of the small committee approach.
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Continuing in 2,024 and beyond. Thank you very much. Not seeing any other
comments.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:14.000
I will say I think it's worked out very well. I think we get a lot of lot
of good work and a lot of good conversations.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:25.000
There are occasions where I think, wow, I wish the whole board would hear
this. And I've even said to people occasionally, well, you should go back
and look at the.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:33.000
You know look at that discussion. I think one of those is our survey
discussion at the performance committee this week.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:40.000
It's certainly worth everyone taking a full look at the survey. If you
haven't done so, I know Ms. Johnson sent something out.
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000
But generally, I tend to agree. I think it's working well. Director
Catlin.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Thank you. I'm in support of these smaller committees and I think the
only times that I have found There to be a little bit of an awkward
moment is when.
00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:03.000
The committee moves something forward but the full board may wanna
discuss that. So I think we do have the opportunity to.
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:12.000
To pull something from a consent agenda, but I think we haven't really
defined what that process might look like.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:19.000
It's only happened a couple times, but it can be a little awkward.
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Dr. Davidson. Yeah. Thank you, Madam Chair.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:34.000
I was going to note something similar to Dr. Kalin you brought up that
there have been some times I think Director Tisdale did this recently
with the finance and planning meeting just saying even though it was
unanimous at committee this was worth the whole board hearing.
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Let's bring it forward at the board meeting and I think that is a good
practice when that does arise.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:53.000
And for one, I would say I think this has been great. And something we
talked about 2 retreats ago was the importance of having committee chairs
present reports at the board meetings.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:00.000
I think that has been helpful. I think we should continue to really, you
know, look to our committee chairs to do that.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
And I think the committee plans also present an opportunity to give a
look forward. And state things that are going to be coming before the
committee that directors might want to come and attend as well.
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:18.000
So for one, I think these have been great. I think they've been useful
and I think we should continue down this path and I would also just
continue to encourage continued use of those committee chair reports and
also appreciate Dr.
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Calvin's point and Director Tisdale utilizing that recently of Bringing
things to the full board.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Thanks. Thank you. Seeing no other conversation, we will move on. Thanks
for the feedback.
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:57.000
One of the next thing is getting some feedback on the idea that's been
circulating a bit of setting certain committee appointments for 2 years
and the idea is that after the election year we would make committee
appointments and I think it's really the executive community makes the
appointments mostly at this point.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:25.000
We'd make committee appointments and the I guess in my vision and
nothing's written yet but that those would generally be considered twoyear appointments in order to gain expertise and you know consistency I'm
going to turn this over here in a minute to Director Davidson who has
also been thinking along these lines and raising the idea.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:38.000
But I think that you know especially for this year and maybe generally we
want to keep it flexible but but that would be the hope is that we could
keep committees same for next year.
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Richard Davidson. Yeah, thank you, Chair. So this is one I think, we
still, we need to get some feedback on and would encourage characters to
talk about it here and also to reach out with feedback and ideas.
00:59:45.000 --> 01:00:05.000
This one's tricky to get right, I think. But the ad hoc audit committee
went through a real head scratcher here that audit absolutely has to have
consistency on its committee.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And there has to be, good mechanisms in place to retain consistency on
its committee. And there has to be consistency on its committee.
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:22.000

And there has to be good mechanisms in place to retain institutional
knowledge and committee knowledge and progress, again, past So we went
through an effort that, you know, in some ways seemed longer than it
should be, but it turned out tricky to do the math.
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:35.000
You know, we brought in these outside. Experts to serve as outside
members and then we had to think about how to stagger terms both with our
RTD elected board members and our outside committee members.
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I think in many ways we're still learning. We'll have our look back in a
couple years on that but we we do we did put forward something now that
we can actually work an audit plan, a multi-year audit plan.
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I'm living through a performance committee right now. Again, I mentioned
that it seems like we kind of repeat every January.
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Of again, I mentioned that it seems like we kind of repeat every January
and this is something that our general manager and CEO has dealt every
January and this is something that our general manager and CEO has dealt
with in her role.
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And I think it's something that the board needs to really consider how do
we develop consistency across these committees.
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
One thing, you know, speaking of, 2,010 being a little while ago and
reacting to the state audit report.
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:21.000
In the presentation we had the language that you know the state auditor
had noted that having a dedicated committee membership is a primary means
by which board members can develop subject matter expertise.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:40.000
The other thing that they had stated at the time, and I'm going to read
this, It's in the the packet packet page 21 although board members
receive a $12,000 annual stipend authorized under state statute many
board members have other full-time careers.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I appreciate that note. Statute also does not require board members to
possess specialized expertise. Given these realities, ensuring that the
board's committee structure provides for an adequate division of labor
and subject matter expertise is important for increasing the efficiency
and effectiveness of the limited time that individual members may have
available to board to devote to board activities.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:22.000

So I'd like to note there is between the 2 notes that the auditor pointed
out, having a dedicated committee structure allows us as directors to
develop the expertise in the individual committee, get used to those work
plans, develop their relationships with staff, and maintain consistency
of work plan.
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It also affords us the opportunity when we are talking about committee
work plans to consider those on a multi-year basis when we have these,
you know, have our retreats and we're talking about a board we know will
be together for at least 2 years.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And the other thing I'll note is that when someone does come in with some
expertise that's relevant to a committee, we should pull them in that
committee.
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:51.000
This is something that the board auditor noted as being a potential risk
of the elected board is that we aren't, we don't have to have specialized
expertise.
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.000
So when we have it, if we have a public finance expert. It'd be great to
have them on the finance and planning committee.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Likewise on the operational side. So, you know, I don't think this is
fully defined.
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I think in many ways we're, it's Groundhog Day, Director Catlin going
back to how would you think about consistency and does what happens if a
whole committee turns over which I suppose is a risk now anyway.
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
But I just wanted to open the floor to discussion around how do we start
to tackle this? Is it every committee?
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Is it certain committees? You know, we did this for audit and I think we
need to explore it from across the whole board.
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Thanks. Thank you. Comments, feedback.
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Any thoughts? Yes. Dr. Bouquet.
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Yes, thank you very much, Madam Chair. Have you guys started planning out
the feasibility if this would happen come the 2,024 cycle so regarding it
because of the way I'm interpreting this and my apologies is it's we're

referring to our 3 standing committees correct So we've looked at already
the feasibility of where all the directors are.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So for instance, you know, me being on operations does this count as my
first year in operations and therefore I'd go to operations next year as
a standing committee member or is it that since I've been on that
standing committee for 2 years I have the opportunity to then jump to the
financial committee.
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I'm just curious if the feasibility has been discussed or not. No, I
think that this is a less considered it's really initial feedback and and
that's exactly the situation that I was saying I think certainly that I
think the policy should be flexible anyhow if somebody says I really want
to be on finance next year but certainly this year the appointments were
made for one year I think if we were to move
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:51.000
toward this it would be this is sort of the suggestion. That's my thought
that's not any, you know, any decision.
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So tell me what you think. Tell us what you think. I like the idea. I'm
just kind of thinking about the overall feasibility of it.
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I'm just thinking about it. Again, this is coming from a teacher brain of
like, ever going to lose like, could we potentially lose committee
members due to election, you know, that's like a huge factor when it
comes down to it.
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
If you don't have directors you're gonna run or not. They can do it
during the election.
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I mean it would be it would start at like this year after the election.
It would go till next year.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
So it would it would be the 2 years where there's no change. I would be
all for it.
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I think it's just having the flexibility if a director. Has a desire. So
for instance, I speak for myself, I've served on operations for 2 years
and I love the operations.
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I probably will be on operations next year. I'm hoping because I want to
develop that expertise in that specific field.
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:46.000

But again, I think it's more than fair for directors say, hey, I want to
also jump to, X or I want to jump from one standing committee to another.
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:52.000
But I would be in favor of it. I don't see. Many downfalls as long as
it's feasible and you have flexibility.
01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:01.000
So thank you. Great, that's good feedback. Thank you. Director, jumping
around, Director Whitmore, is that you next?
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I guess so. Just one question. I assume this does not include the exact
committee. So that would be a one-year continuation.
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Okay. All right. I think it has. Otherwise I think it does have some
merit for some more head scratching.
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Yeah, first spiced your Catlin. Thank you, Madam Chair. Pointing back to
the work plans if we develop some comprehensive work plans for the
committees.
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:50.000
That may span more than one year if there is a particular item of
interest to a board member who may be sitting on the other committee they
might be able to make a request to switch over based on a specific area
of interest.
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Good. That gets back to your flexibility point. Madam Chair. Right.
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:05.000
. Not knowing anything else because we haven't even finished a full year
yet on this board. I'm excited to hear this.
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:32.000
My concern was flexibility, so I'm glad to hear that's there. However, I
do have to say, performance committee which I sit on does it does and it
is going to require some dedicated people to stick around to make sure
that the plans go forward correctly so that there is continuity and that
there is a forward moving momentum that is not lost even if some new
members are brought on with flexibility.
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
There needs to be enough people there to continue the work that's been
started because it is good work.
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And I think all of them are that way. But that working plan, that's the
key. If somebody is going to join or looking at doing it, I don't
necessarily want to feel restricted and being able to learn about the
other committees.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:58.000
But I selectively Asked to be on the committees that I currently serve on
for a reason and if you don't expand your knowledge then you never have
the opportunity.
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.000
And if you don't expand your knowledge, then you never have the
opportunity to grow, and you never have the opportunity to grow, and so
that would prevent somebody from becoming a member of the opportunity to
grow, right?
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:15.000
And so that would prevent somebody from becoming a member of perhaps the
executive council for a year. And so if that's the direction that this is
going, I think it's good, but I agree, some head scratching, really
thoughtful, comprehensive way to look at this.
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000
In a holistic manner. Take a drink. To be able to continue forward with
that work is really important.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I don't always know what's going on with that work is really important. I
don't always know what's going on with safety and operations if I don't
make the meeting, to continue forward with that work is really important.
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I don't always know what's going on with safety and operations if I don't
make the meeting but I do read my notes and I try to watch and go back
and review so I think that this is a good thing.
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:39.000
But I know where my focus needs to be because I am on a specific
committee. So I want to make sure that that's where my attention is all
of the time.
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Good feedback. Thanks, Director Davidson. Yeah, this is great feedback
and thanks and and to your point, Chair and Dr.
01:08:47.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Bouquet yet not fully formed out, so I think we wanted to start
collecting these ideas. I did want to comment on the election piece
because you know as you were talking about that Director Buchan I'm kind
of chuckling thinking about what we talked about with audit and something
I might put out there is this would be tricky but we could think about
this may not be bylaws this may be our practices and
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000
standard procedures but we could identify when we make these committee
appointments. We sort of already have some consistency on these
committees.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Many of us have been on the same committees. But, we could think about
the mix of newer members.
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:37.000
And members, I should say, staggered elections. And make sure that we
have, you know, I'm going to use the term succession planning kind of
loosely, but thinking about leadership development in those committees,
thinking about how we make sure we don't have a major disruption in
election.
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It may be that we mix committees where we say, you know, Of course, if we
have the expertise, we want someone on a particular relevant committee,
but we may say that by having the right mix of, this group that's in 2
years and this group that's in 4 years we can prevent some of those
disruptions you're referring to.
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Headscratcher, I agree with the comments that have been made. You know,
the ad hoc got it.
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:16.000
We were putting together these Excel charts that would stagger everybody
and extend it out by about 10 years and take a look at how they
overlapped and that may be something we want to do here as we all think
about this and as it relates to our individual expertise.
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000
So that stimulates some more conversation, and great. Thank you. Dr.
Bouquet.
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Yes, I have been stimulated by the conversation. Sorry. Yeah, I think
it's just important for us to realize that you potentially could have
your majority of your board gone.
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:55.000
In election in theory in theory you could potentially lose your majority
of your board and I think that's What is the priorities, I think, is what
we can consider because it's like in theory you have 8 new board members,
and how do you stagger that is the priority of it for it to continue with
those action plans.
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And therefore, it might not necessarily be expertise then, when those 8
members come on. So I think that would just be consideration of
potentially how high a turnover could potentially happen and the core
staggering.
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Thank you very much. Thank you. Yeah, good point. Okay, I'm not seeing
anyone online.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:24.000
So thank you for the feedback. We are moving very well on our schedule.
Next section is best practices and this gets it a few different things.
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000
The first one is talking about respecting staff work plans and time. You
know, there are a couple of ways this has been coming up recently.
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:52.000
One of them is that Jack Crowe and Deborah Johnson and I have been
working and John McKay and others have been working on you know how we
get how we communicate within the agency with questions from.
01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Constituents or from board members and Who should get what and how it's
tracked and all of those things.
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And honestly. Those questions are not decided. We're still working on
them, I think Jack and Deborah and I are meeting next week and Deborah
and Jack and John McKay are meeting to work on some of those.
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And the other one is, you know, just board members needing information.
And all of those things come down to, you know, the issue of how we
respect the fact that our staff.
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Have a lot on their plates and you know I want to be responsive to the
board. And.
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:49.000
How we are respecting that. The fact that there's only so much that the
team can do with limited resources and it was pointed out that there are
2 resolutions included in tonight's packet.
01:12:49.000 --> 01:13:06.000
That we're passed by this board. As far as I know, they're both in
effect, but basically, look at the second one in 1,996 that requests from
a board member or subset of board members which are anticipated to take 4
or more hours on a single subject should be channeled through the chair
or full board for approval.
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:24.000
You know, that was responding to issues at the time. But what we're
looking for is you know, how do we, respect our staff's time and still
ensure that board members are appropriately supported.
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Either in getting responses for their constituents or in information for
themselves so looking for some feedback on that on these, potentially on
this 4 h.
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:53.000

Ruled that some that the board in the past has done or just more
generally. Any feedback we have.
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Dr. Bouquet. I am active tonight. Thank you.
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:05.000
It's good. I'm on my third cup of coffee though, so I'm going to keep
going.
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Has there been discussion regarding just like board members channeling
communication to the chair? And the chair acting as the liaison of the
board when it comes down to just talking with staff or talking with the
CEO or GM.
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You know, seeing different people respond, I think, The problem is we
haven't found the perfect solution and I see Ms. Johnson so with the
response on her face so I'd like you to address this too.
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:48.000
There has been discussion of channeling through the board office and I
think that that's kind of where we're coming out is that these issues
should go to our team in the board office.
01:14:48.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Sometimes they are not quite sure, you know, where they go, but I think
Jack and I have been talking some today even about, in the past before
the staff and everyone else, we would send things in for this, what they
call them, AGR, AGMs, what's that, Valley?
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:17.000
TMRs, yeah, the general manager, something. But then we'd never hear
anything back.
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And I think with Ms. Johnson and others, that policy has really been, you
know, there's been an effort to change it and I know that Jack and
Tishra.
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And Julian and Marie are all working hard to do that. So there is an
effort to channel it through the board office.
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:46.000
But there are things, it's hard to know what goes to. To, this Johnson,
what goes to me, what goes to, you know, those are the kind of issues
we're working on.
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:53.000
So anybody else, either of you'd like to respond, Deborah, or Jack?
01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:04.000

Thank you very much. Madam Chair and to Director Bouquet, the reason why
I had a pensive look on my face is because I don't think that everything
has to go to the chair.
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I report to this body collectively and you have pointed the chair but I
report to the board of directors and you as individual comprise the
board.
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
So I don't want that to be stifled because that's very analogous to me.
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Saying to Melanie, no you can't talk to me, you need to go around and
talk to someone else.
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:26.000
So that is not conducive. I think to the betterment of this organization
and how I'm leading this organization in tandem with you providing policy
direction.
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:38.000
So with that as a backdrop, I think the issue that is prevalent for me is
inundation of emails but not understanding who's on first.
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
So case in point I may get an email from a board member that copied to
the board and it could be a member of my staff.
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
This says I need you all to respond. Well, when you do that, who's on
first?
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Because somebody's making an assumption. There was a situation just the
other day that was brought to my attention.
01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:03.000
In some instances, I'm not included on the initial, initial inquiry. And
then when there's no response, then I get a thread saying, oh.
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:14.000
No one's responded to this or unbeknownst to me. There's other staff that
are running in circles because somebody may have responded directly and
that communicate wasn't shared with me with having the responsibility.
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:22.000
So I find this to be quite a quadmire here at this organization because
I've worked in others where there was processes that were instituted.
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And so when you think about the boys role from a policy vantage point,
then operational matters if one has a question about, you know,
operational aspect or something like that.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Does that need to come to me? Not necessarily. And that's something that
could be done through a standard process where something is tracked and
you're utilizing, you know, a case number and it goes full circle because
there could be multiple channels utilizing our CRM which is customer
relations management software because this could be some inquiry that was
sent through a multitude of different conduits because somebody wants a
response and an expeditious fashion.
01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:06.000
So then we run the risk of having somebody in the organization at a
different level responding, but then maybe something's come to my office
and we're disparate in reference to what we're doing.
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:22.000
So there needs to be a focused approach and then basically qualifying it
is it operational administrative that it's from a policy vantage point I
think that's imperative because there's a delineation quite naturally and
I don't have a problem with sharing information with the board.
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Quite naturally, you guys are representing a constituency that's
utilizing the services that we provide. So I just think we need to hone
in on what it is that we're doing because in certain instances
everybody's globbing around and wanting to be responsive.
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And in that vein, we're missing the opportunity to actually be consistent
with how we're addressing concerns and doing it in a deliberate and
meaningful fashion.
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:53.000
So I think there's opportunity. I know I've spoken with the board
executive manager, John McCain that's on my staff having worked
previously in the board office.
01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:04.000
There's certain examples that we can leverage and there's been a
multitude of different things I know of Mr. Kroll had reached out after I
had inquired, you know, utilizing app to connect because we shouldn't be
reinventing the will.
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
We're not the only transit agency that represents multitude of different
constituencies and deliver transit services. It's just being succinct.
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And basically, we often are creatures of habit because when I hear about
this former process it was established because the chair just said this I
wasn't here so I'm a repeat what you said there was that GMR process and
it was created because perhaps somebody in a seat that I'm currently
sitting wasn't responsive.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I pride myself on being responsive, so I don't want to use the cookie
cutter approach because we're dealing with different issues here.
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
So first we have to recognize what is the problem we're trying to solve
for and then address it in a very cohesive fashion.
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So that's what I would offer up as to the comments that I would like to
share. Or that I've shared things that you shared.
01:19:49.000 --> 01:20:04.000
And I want, Jack to respond too, but I think you can hear. Yeah, sort of
the complexity of this and, you know, the what we're struggling with and
it's to get make sure that directors get what they need.
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And are able to talk to the right person and to figure out exactly. How
to make that work and and a piece of this is, you know, like I say,
there's this four-hour rule.
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:34.000
But really, you know, a big piece of it is picking and picking and
choosing what you need and then I think the best source is going to the
board office with your questions check you wanna address this?
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair. You know the big issues that we have
identified so far in my time here are directors knowing when something
has gone forward to staff for review so you might write into the board
office but you might not know, hey we've opened a case on this.
01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:01.000
We also, and the situation gave rise to it this week, you know, need to
make sure that we're informing board members.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:18.000
When something has been addressed. And this, we'll just have to ask for
your grace, means you're going to get a little bit more email traffic
because you're going to know when something is opened and know when
something is closed and you know we can continue to refine that.
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I'm dedicated to working with the GM and CEO as well as John Mackay on
her team to making sure that we're routing things and triaging things
appropriately.
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:36.000
You know, one thing we don't have control over in the board office and
neither do any of you is the inputs to our system.
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:51.000

The impulse to our process for getting a response on any given day in a
massive system, you have one of the largest systems in the country with
many different routes, there's going to be things that Just don't work
the way that we would hope them to.
01:21:51.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And so those various different types of requests are going to be. You
know, there's going to be an unlimited universe potentially of various
different things that could arise that might need to be responded to.
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:24.000
We are in the process of building and the intent is to have something out
that's new come January of 2,024 that leverages the existing CRM for the
agency Salesforce and really allows us to track on these issues better
and also provide data and information back to you all.
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Because I think sometimes that helps put things in perspective. Of
course, obviously you're getting the issues that are coming to you all,
but it can also be helpful to have a complete understanding of just how
much stuff comes in on a daily basis to frame administration in the board
office's ability to get these things resolved because as the GM and CEO
mentioned and I want to put a fine point on this.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Our goal is not necessarily to get a response out as quickly as possible,
although sometimes it feels like that.
01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Our goal really needs to be to get the most appropriate response out and
in a way that the GM and CEO is appropriately involved and has insights
into what's going out the door is ultimately she's the accountable
executive as she puts it, right?
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000
That's all I have. Great. Thanks, Director Davidson. Yeah, thank you very
much.
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I think this is an important topic. And I'd like to just thank General
Manager and I'd like to just thank General Manager and I'd like to just
thank General Manager and CEO Johnson for your responsiveness.
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
You are extremely responsiveness. You are extremely responsive and I
appreciate that. CEO Johnson for your responsiveness. You are extremely
responsive and I appreciate that.
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Sometimes I do worry since there are so many of us. And one of you and as
it was once put to me, your email inbox is a to do list created by
somebody else.
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:50.000

And so I think that the importance here is having process. And Miss
Johnson, you referenced having come from some places, which I think is
one of the reasons that this board hired you is the breadth of your
experience from other agencies.
01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:09.000
You mentioned having some other processes in place and I'm wondering if
you have any. Thoughts, ideas that you'd like to share at this time and
if not that's OK around processes you might recommend for exactly this
topic that would work for you and your staff.
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Madam Chair, if I may. Please. Yes, thank you so much, Director Davidson.
Yes, having a centralized portal where things go in and we all adhere to
that.
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.000
That's what a boils down to because recognizing that this is a large
board, but even more so, there's different conduits as I specified,
right?
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000
So utilizing a community, sorry, a customer resource management tool
where everything goes in so we have an understanding about who's on
first.
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:52.000
That way there can be a response because as I said before, We often are
doing things in a scattersshot approach and basically if there's a
process whereby something comes into the board office, it will be routed
to me appropriately, but I want to be clear, I'm not saying that US board
members can't reach out to me directly.
01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I mean, I know there was some confusion previously when we talked about
that, Basically, increase that we're getting from constituents and you
all need a response, that should go through the board office and there is
a portal where those can be tracked.
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Now quite naturally if we're dealing and I've made eye contact with
director Sloan so I'll use her if we're dealing with the issue with the
municipality or something like that, I'm not saying if you're talking to
a member of a city council, oh my gosh, you can't reach out to me
directly and say, I think that's a little different.
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:43.000
So that's what I'm talking about. If something's operational in nature,
whereby, somebody had a question about the runtime as it relates to the
average speed of a vehicle and what does that mean to the implications of
the time point and how we're doing scheduling.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:56.000

Operational in nature. I don't necessarily have to be privy to that and
that should go through that portable on the flip side if there's
something that is happening when we are talking about from a policy
vantage point you're dealing with another policymaker.
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Of course you can reach out to me and copy the board office and that has
happened. I think what Mr. Kroll and I had talked about yesterday, we
need to discern what's policy.
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And then what's administrative operational in nature? And then more so, I
know that people on the board have been here for a period of time and
may.
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Have had previous interaction with staff members, but that doesn't
necessarily mean they're their appropriate staff person to address the
question because so on so may have worked on a parking issue back in
2,017 that doesn't mean that person is still working on said parking
issue as it relates to 2,023 and I think that's what causes consternation
or if in fact something is.
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Confused relative to a topic, right? If we're talking about the influx of
migrants in the area versus unhoused.
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:54.000
That could be 2 different people working on something because we're
talking about people that need needs that are in need doesn't mean it's
the same person.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And so I think basically what we're working towards is identifying, for
instance, identifying a sole contact for a department whereby the board
staff can coordinate and let me just give you some feedback because I did
bring this into this organization when I came.
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:18.000
So members of the leadership team typically have support personnel, an
executive assistant business supporter, things of the like.
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And recognizing I meet with the leadership team on a recurring basis. My
executive assistant Tina Aragon leaves the charge in working with what I
qualify as the administrative coordinating team, the act.
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:44.000
So if in fact there's increase coming in, that person who coordinates
with Tina, who is a surrogate of the leader of the department, basically
would have a better understanding of who should address.
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:51.000

An inquiry that comes in. So there's a single point of contact for the
board office. And so they can then shepherd that through their
department.
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And in that way, the leader of said department is aware of what's
happening as well. So that's one example.
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Having the act, that's why Tina attends the leadership team meeting. She
carries forward information and then we've had presentations relative to
what's happening, IE.
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Formulating a new style guide. How is that implemented? How are we
utilizing? Brand messaging that may be something the act talks about or
they can come up with creative solution.
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:22.000
So that is a conduit. I think that we can leverage here at this
organization as opposed to just making an assumption.
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I want to send this to Director Gusman because I talked to him last time
where actually it should be director Davidson who gets that.
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But for all intents and purposes, having that 1 point of contact through
the administrative coordinating team, that individual knows who within
that department would both be appropriate to address this question and
can go figure that out.
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:45.000
And then that's a point of contact that the board office has. So that's
what I would offer up.
01:28:45.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I'm not saying this is a theta complete, but this is what I offered up
when I had a conversation in Tina Aragon on my staff has been working
with the board office and provided that information relative to the
administrative coordinating team as a path forward potentially.
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Thank you. Thanks. That's all. Alright, if you all don't mind, I'm gonna
go to director Rosenthal online.
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I just wanted to reinforce what a lot of
folks were saying and including General Manager.
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:23.000
You know, about how important it is that we do direct a lot of our
traffic through the board office.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:31.000
And I hope to think that's something I'm trying to do more and more.
Particularly as I'm in public a lot as an elected board member, you know,
we are responsible to our constituents.
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:48.000
We're responsible to make sure that we are listening and we are bringing
issues to our TDs attention that folks at our Tds attention that folks at
our team may or may not know about.
01:29:48.000 --> 01:30:08.000
So, so to me, you know, that's, you know, I just wanna make sure that
that's okay that, you know, that we are doing, you know, what we're
supposed to be doing, which is to bring issues to the for and that that's
not necessarily quote counted against us that like hey you know risen all
you're bringing up so many of these issues you're in the community a lot
we're hearing so
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:15.000
many things I think that's normal. I think that's what we should be
doing. And I think that's okay.
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
You know, my concern would be, you know, sort of coming up with ideas or
drilling down on maybe issues.
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:34.000
We're either thinking about on you know or before us issues that are
before us on the board or just things that we think are important like oh
you know what I want a copy of this I want a copy of that.
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I need to know this information. Well you know that's That is good, but
it is.
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000
You know that's certainly a different issue. Then maybe some of us in
community that are advocating for our constituents.
01:30:47.000 --> 01:31:00.000
And I just wanna make sure that. You know, that sort of, that's in this
conversation as well.
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Okay, thanks very much. I think you're right. I think it is in the
conversation. And that's a tough one too you know do you bring every
constituent question forward is it, you know, how do you address those?
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I think the short answer is these. Those need to go to our board office,
our very talented board office.
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:31.000

Unless as Johnson was saying there. Policy or you know dealing with
elected officials things like that but I say that as a short answer it
has been difficult for us to.
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Marks apart and really put into effect. But we're working on it. So
that's great.
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Director Sloan.
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Yeah, get it. Thank you. And I really appreciate having the opportunity
to discuss this. I think this is basic issue for our governance study
session.
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:14.000
And it appears to me that the board members don't really know the. The
organization of staff and who's responsible at any particular time for
anything.
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I don't think it is. The board members interest. Who produce the process.
We just need to know what the process is.
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And follow it because we don't know about prioritization as Mr. Cole
said, how many issues are out there.
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:52.000
We don't No, how do I identify particular staff members? We've been You
know, the former process, as the Chair mentioned, things are just
disappear.
01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Now it's lovely that we do get. Quick answers, but. Apparently. I'm, I,
you know, not been.
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Following a preferred process. I think if we all know the process. We can
accept it and run with it and and would get good answers.
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:27.000
There's a reference to resolution, 1,996, the more. Recent resolution I
think should.
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Be tossed completely because they It really, it was probably helpful then
and the intent is the same as we're talking about now, but.
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Who, who estimates a death? It would be 4 h and how long does that take?
And Members of the public that would take more than 2 h of work?

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Well, if the board is bringing it up, it's a board request. Not a public
request.
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:14.000
And the part about being channeled to the full board of directors, which
meets once a month. Is really not at all helpful.
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:24.000
So I think whatever we come up with. Yeah, it should totally contradict
the 1996. Resolution.
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:30.000
That's good feedback and I will say that's that's what the effort is
right now is to come up.
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I totally agree. The board members, I have trouble figuring out where to
come up. I totally agree.
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
The board members, I have trouble figuring out where to send something. I
totally agree. The board members, I have trouble figuring out where to
send something.
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000
So, you know, we're getting there, I think. And, hopefully we'll have a
process that will be.
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Easier to follow, Director Harwick. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a few
thoughts here.
01:34:50.000 --> 01:35:16.000
One, I'm wildly excited about the CRM and I think they're being situation
where our requests are going where they need to go and are getting around
the right way sounds like a really just great thing for everybody for us
as board members but also just as staff and being able to track like, oh
hey, I received, I'm guessing maybe there was something about what
happened in Arvada the other day and
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:30.000
maybe that's what you were referring to. But either way, like, situation,
something happened in our bat and I'm glad that it was resolved, but I
feel like, you know, maybe there was like 8 different tendrils of
information going out there.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And luckily it was resolved. But I think the CR, the system management
system would have been really.
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Helpful. And so I'm psyched about that because I don't think that the
four-hour question is the right question we should be asking it just how

can we be more efficient and be a more effective with our time with our
staff's time.
01:35:50.000 --> 01:36:06.000
So anything we can do to do that is exciting for me. But if we are going
to get stuck on the four-hour, if we are not getting rid of that, I just
want to recognize a couple things that there are a couple directors here
that have super their Constituents are highly reliant upon transit.
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Much more so than my constituents in Arvada. We have 3 lines. Anyone that
represents Denver or Aurora is going to just be inundated with calls and
so I think if we have a four-hour commitment that's not particularly fair
to those board directors whereas for me like it's an easy thing and I can
be like hey you know.
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I'm not getting anywhere near that staff time, but if we are going to
hold to that, we just need to be recognized.
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:45.000
You need to recognize that there are directors that have certain issues
that we don't. Some of us don't.
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000
And also that's that's where I'm at right now. Thank you. Thank you.
01:36:49.000 --> 01:37:01.000
I will just note that the more recent of those 2 talks about 4 h on a
single subject of those who talks about 4 h on a single subject, which I
also don't find that the more recent of those who talks about 4 h on a
single subject, which I also don't find very helpful because what's the
subject?
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000
You know, is it this one constituent? Is it this other? So I'm not
disagreeing with you.
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.000
That's what their effort was. Director T is Dale. Thank you very much,
Madam Chair.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I was prepared to say at first, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I think
the four-hour rule is good.
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:30.000
We had a number of occasions. Several years ago where we literally had
our staff being bogged down by requests.
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:47.000
To the border office to provide listings of all kinds of data that just
took up a huge amount of time and can you research in the minutes please
and find every time that we referenced a certain subject.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.000
And it obviously was just very, very burdensome and we had to make sure
that we reminded the director involved of the four-hour rule.
01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:03.000
And I think that's still important. But I really see that this
discussion. Is talking about 2 different things.
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:15.000
First of all, how much time can we demand of staff? And then secondly,
How do we demand things of staff?
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:27.000
And the policy that I learned and as chair I certainly enforced was to
tell directors, focus your communications on the board office.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:41.000
In order to allow coordination of requests and to get the best possible
response. You should of course as an elected board member.
01:38:41.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Feel free to reach out to the general manager at any time on any
question, but for heaven's sakes have the The foresight, if you will, to
copy the board office on that request too so that the board office can
again coordinate and understand this.
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:18.000
And one other thing, and I don't know if this is. Sort of an unstated
part of the agenda here, it should not be the task of a director.
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:28.000
To reach out to people other than the board office and the general
manager unless it is urgent and important.
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Understandably, there are circumstances where that would arise, but if
you feel you want to ask. The AGM for buses.
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Certain question. You really should in the first instance funnel it
through the board office and say tell me now you can as necessary again
certainly if it's urgent and important.
01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Reach out to them. But otherwise, be respectful of their time. As mayor,
I used to lecture the city council a lot and say, look, if you have a
problem with public works.
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
You don't call up and complain to public works. You call up and complain
to the city manager.
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:18.000

If the problem isn't fixed, you don't fire the public works director, you
fire the city manager.
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000
And we have the same situation here. So you bring up the problem to the
general manager and to the board office and say can you please address
this.
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And that I submit will give you the best possible answer. But don't be
too quick to throw out the four-hour rule.
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:48.000
It's something that has served us well over the years and certainly takes
care of situations where a director.
01:40:48.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Can abuse staff time by saying, I want to know, for example, we had this
issue arise, every piece of property that is owned by the RTD.
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:12.000
And we couldn't put staff on that. I mean that's just ridiculous. We did
ask Capitol programs ultimately to give us the list and they did.
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
But it's not a question of saying, OK, now you have to drop everything
and produce this for me.
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:29.000
No, we can't do that. So work through the board office. Coordinate, get
the best answer and I think we will find that it works well.
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Thank you. Thank you. Director Existale, Director Gusw.
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I didn't realize it was my turn. Sorry. Thank you, Madam Chair. Here's my
problem, right?
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I'm glad we're talking about this, but I have been working on an issue
for months and trying to be respectful of months and trying to be
respectful of this rule.
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Has required me to delay getting work done. For months because it
requires more than I can ask of the staff currently to get one single
project done.
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000
And it's one issue in one area. So I have put in countless hours of my
own time.
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:22.000

After reading board documents after preparing for meetings after
participating in committees after showing up to community events. To
research municipal codes without help to research legal issues without
help on my own finding a way to do it as an elected member of the board
to answer a question for my constituent.
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I would point out to the members of this body and anybody else listening
that we each represent about what, 270,000 constituents each, more or
less, right?
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Still more than a state senator. And they have office staff individual to
them to do that work. We share.
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:52.000
For office staff in the board. So there is something to that to be
considered, right? How much do I need to delay on an issue?
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
To be respectful of staff time. And trying to do it the right way, right?
I'm also on the hook.
01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I'm responsible for getting an answer to constituents. And doing the
meetings and setting them up and doing all that part.
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000
So. I do want to be respectful of staff time. I don't want everybody here
all night.
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:16.000
I get up at 3 30 in the morning. I get up at 3 30 in the morning to get
to my work, I get up at 3 30 in the morning to get to my work right after
the board meeting on Wednesday, so I get it.
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:23.000
It's a delicate subject, but sometimes an issue may require more time
than others. And I always try to be respectful of that.
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I think I have good relationships with our board staff and with the GM
CEO. As well as with her staff and I try not to reach out to anybody.
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Other than those 2 people if I'm not sure where it's going. If it's an
ongoing matter, I have already discussed it.
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:42.000
We've gotten permission to be able to continue dialogue with an
individual, but it's been routed properly.
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:53.000

So I do take Director T is Dale's remark seriously that we need to find
out who we're supposed to be working with and then go from there and be
respectful of that time.
01:43:53.000 --> 01:44:04.000
However, Delaying an answer for months to try and respect a four-hour
rule on an issue is incredibly painful and difficult and begging for
patients from somebody.
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Does get to a breaking point even I think for the best of directors. And
so I just want to keep that in mind.
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:26.000
I don't know. If throwing it out isn't exactly the right thing to do. But
I don't know that limiting what we need to do with respect to public
service is the You know, it's the counterbalance to that.
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
So I'm not sure where I'd fall on this, but I'm glad we're having the
conversation.
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Either way. Just from a personal perspective, I would say this has caused
me a lot of consternation.
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:43.000
And a lot of extra work on my part that I probably could reach out to
somebody on staff and say, hey, I know you are the expert in this and you
probably have a really good connection.
01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Can you at least help me get there? But I am hesitant at best. And scared
at the worst.
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:57.000
To reach out to anybody because it seems like we as directors are not
invited to do so. All the time, right?
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And that cuts 2 ways. Sometimes we have to and sometimes we don't. But
when we do, It better be important.
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.000
It's all I'm saying, right? And I'm not sure that there's anything other
than cultural practice.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Each one teaching one if you've had to deal with those issues before for
the folks that may be joining this board in a year.
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:24.000
To give that guidance and shepherd us through that process. So. Well, I
think, you know, that's very good comment.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
And I think that that's a reminder that, you know, if we keep this rule
or really any of our rules, flexibility is key.
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:37.000
And I don't think anybody's wanting you to be doing that. I see Ms.
Johnson sort of responding.
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I'd like her to. To give a response, but I guess, you know, in a
situation like that, Thanks, staff is, you know, flexible and responsive
and, Miss Johnson, do you want to?
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Respond.
01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Yes, thank you very much, Madam Chair, and as Director Guzman, intimated
in his comments that yes, he can reach out directly to me and has.
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I would say the example that he brought forward is a little more
complicated in the sense that our TDD doesn't have auspices over the
issue he's talking about.
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:29.000
And so that's the whole point of the matter. We don't have to go down
that rabbit hole, but I'm very familiar with it and he has had support
from our staff perspective, but it's dealing with a constituent that
wants something else that really involves a different municipality.
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000
So I would say when we have situations such as that because he and I
engaged and we talked about it, because he and I engaged and we talked
about it, that those are those anomalies and it gets back to what, that
those are those anomalies and it gets back to what, that those are those
anomalies and it gets back to what Director Tisdale talked about before.
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:43.000
And it gets back to what Director Tisdale talked about before. Of course
you can reach out to me. This is my job.
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I report to you all. I have day-to-day auspices over the operations of
the organization.
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:56.000
And of course, if you're getting questions relative to some aspect of our
service delivery, what we're doing collectively.
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I am here to be supportive of that. So I just for your edification just
wanted to qualify.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:15.000
That's really an outlier which is unfortunate, but I think with Director
Guzman's commitment, he's trying to go above and beyond that falls
outside of the REM of RTD because oftentimes people are confused about.
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:26.000
The specialized district that we are and what our responsibilities
consist of, which is providing mass transit service to the Denver
metropolitan area.
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:33.000
So thank you for the opportunity to offer up some and put there. Thanks.
Thank you. Director Calendar, if you don't mind, I see Director Williams
is.
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Online, or Eastern, were you first? Okay, direct to Calendar. Director
Williams.
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Thank you. I just like us all to remember that there are have been
multiple times when 15 directors have been multiple times when 15
directors have received a letter from a constituent.
01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:05.000
And if we all went about trying to answer that. Without going to a
centralized source, we would be duplicating a lot of work that we didn't
need to duplicate.
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:16.000
And so I'd, really like to see. A funnel. Neck here that allows us to
input information.
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Through process. Thanks.
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Thank you. That's a good reminder. I see Mr. Kroll really quickly. Just
very quickly in the issue in which 15 directors or 10 directors, just
very quickly, in the issue in which 15 directors or 10 directors or a
significant number of directors or 10 directors or 10 directors or 10
directors or 10 directors or a significant number of directors receive an
email, which 15 directors or 10 directors or a significant number of
directors receive an email, my recommendation on that would be to
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
ensure in which 15 directors or a significant number of directors receive
an email, my recommendation on that would be to ensure that the chair and
the GM and CEO follow up on that and that you leave it.
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:46.000
To the chair in the GM CEO to follow up on it. And keep you in it.
Alright, Dr.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Kaplan. Thank you. Now I appreciate what Director Williams said. My
practice has been if I get an email from a either a constituent or an
employee.
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:18.000
I don't respond, I forward it. But. Our GM CEO is uses a phrase
frequently when communicating with us that I appreciate and that's fouryear situational awareness and many times when I forward something from a
constituent or to.
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:23.000
The board office, it's for that reason only, just to make you aware so
you're not caught off guard.
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:35.000
And just because I forward an email does not mean I expect action. I just
really once want. The people that can manage it to be aware.
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:47.000
That that's lying out there. So. And maybe for me as a practice, if I do
forward that, I should use that phrase.
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And so that I don't expect anything in return just want to make you
aware.
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Thank you, Dr. Harwick. I'm sorry? Yeah.
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000
It's something to say.
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Yes, thank you very much, Madam Chair. When Mr. Kroll was speaking and he
was talking about correspondence, and he was talking about
correspondence, I wanted to share oftentimes that you all may get an
email that has been distributed independently to each of you and it may
be 15 times over and it's gone to my generic email address.
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:38.000
It's gone to the email address that's identified with my name here in
this organization. So to that point, I wanted to share its imperative to
send that to the board office quite naturally because I've gotten it
several times from you all and I'm like, oh yes, we're on it and then
I've responded back.
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:55.000
So I mean sometimes there's all these outliers but I just wanted to share
that what I have seen is that people want to ensure they're getting a
response so they will just blast it and then in these instances it's
incumbent upon us that's why it's imperative the board office receives it
and you know to me as well so you know the wear addressing the issue.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:06.000
So that's all I just wanted to add. So thank you for indulging me and
I'll yield before to Director Harwick.
01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Thank you. Thank you. What I'm going to ask, I'm not sure it's possible,
Jack, so I'm just gonna say it.
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Something that would be nice, at least for me personally, would be if I'm
submitting something if I'm submitting a ticket or whatever.
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:35.000
So there's a way for me personally would be if I'm submitting something,
if I'm submitting a tick, if it ends up being like a ticket or whatever,
like there's just so there's a way for me to like log in on a backend and
not necessarily see all the information, but just sort of see like a
progress report.
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Like the other day we'll just use our bat again like okay so it was
submitted and then I know that it's with, you know, the deputy chief is
like handling it.
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:50.000
If I haven't gotten any, I can just go in there and see it instead of
harassing the board again just just a way to sort of.
01:51:50.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Track these different things and then when it's done, you know, like it's
close and I just know it's done and maybe I'm getting an email separately
but just a way that I'm not like Getting way in everybody's business, but
I just have a way to sort of see the state of affairs that I that are
affecting me in my community and my constituents.
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Thank you. Good. Dr. Williams, your hand is still up.
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Did you have more?
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
No, I do not. Thank you.
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.000
I'm guessing not. Okay. Dr. Sloan.
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And this is just minor. Is my, yes it is. But I never knew how to get on
the old system to find out the status of a request.
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:57.000

What I would see would always say under review or something like that.
There was a mysterious email portal I think that you could find things on
that I never knew how to do it.
01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:08.000
So I love the idea of a more. Open, intuitive and obvious way to track.
Any requests that we have.
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:19.000
And listening to this discussion, it seems like people. Have different
ideas about what is appropriate. Take to staff.
01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:35.000
And so perhaps the heading of this process. Should take that into
consideration because it seems to me if it's Not an RTD issue.
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Hmm, that's the answer. And it shouldn't be going further and I
appreciate the enthusiasm of directors trying to help people.
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.000
But it doesn't seem to be a staff.
01:53:51.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Problem of this staff it might be jurisdiction jurisdiction or you know,
a county whatever. But it is not something our staff should be tasked.
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:15.000
With. And I think that could be made. Clear in a heading to this process.
Thanks.
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Dr. Guzman.
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:26.000
No. This is a good discussion. I think it's an important discussion. As I
said, we've been working on it.
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:38.000
And, and what we will do is, it may take a little longer to get something
really nailed down, but, we'll circle back, you know, we'll take this
back.
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:50.000
A lot of it's just figuring what goes, you know, just it's hard to make
solid rules that are easy to follow.
01:54:50.000 --> 01:55:02.000
And so we're working on it. Welcome, Jack. Is a good place to take it or
me or, you know, and, and, we'll try to move on.
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:13.000
So, I don't see any other, any other. People wanting to comment, so we
will move on.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Expectations around virtual attendance at in-person board meetings. Jack
Kroll pointed out to me that our.
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Recommended action that we passed was entitled, 2,023 schedule for inperson and remote meetings and for the board of directors this was the
recommended action for the board of directors to approve the 2,023
schedule for in-person and virtual meetings.
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:50.000
And adopting the schedule the board anticipates holding all standing and
ad hoc committee meetings virtually and holding monthly board meetings,
special board meetings, and study sessions in person at the 1616, 60
Blake Street offices.
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Commencing with the March 28 board meeting unless otherwise determined by
the chair in consultation with the executive committee.
01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:06.000
The in-person meetings will still have a hybrid or virtual option for
public participation. I guess this is the opportunity to say how's this
working?
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:18.000
And get your feedback. I actually think it's been working very well. You
know, before the pandemic, we were down here, but 3 nights a month at
least.
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:31.000
You know, I think that people are liking the option of not being down
here 3 nights a month, but I also think that coming down one night a
month and doing it in person is has been really good for.
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Collegiality for our ability to communicate. It definitely makes a
difference. So since this was a 2,023 recommended action I'm looking for.
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Feedback on what we do with 2024 and at the same time you know what are
our expectations if you can be here that you should be here unless you're
expectations.
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
If you can be here, that you should be here unless you're out of town or
sick or something.
01:56:52.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Director Whitmore. Yeah, I just, think that we have a pretty good model
going.
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:07.000

I think it worked pretty well for 2023. That being said, I, you know, I
do encourage.
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Board members for our in person meetings to be here. As much as possible
because we need the Time together before and after the meeting, but.
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Certainly I don't expect Director Williams to be here with. You know the
situation she's in or if we're ill or we've got other issues.
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:35.000
So that's fine. I do think that it has been maybe a bit more helpful to.
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:45.000
You know, trying to defer staff burnout on. Being here in this building
for 12 or 15 HA day, 3 or 4 days a month.
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Now I'm sure that doesn't change the schedule for these 2 down at the end
of the table, but it probably does somewhat, or if you are here, Deborah,
I would imagine you like to beat your desk answering our myriad of
emails.
01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.000
As opposed to, you know. Yeah, okay. All right. Come on, try.
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Okay. So I like the current plan. Let's stick with it. Great.
01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Thank you, Director Davidson.
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Thank you. I also really like this. I think it's worked really well, but
I have a question, I think it's worked really well, but I have a
question, I guess with that being said, for both.
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:36.000
The board office with Mr. Kohl as well as our CEO and general manager.
How's the schedule working for you for for staff time?
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Thank you very much, Madam Chair, if I may. Of course. So I was chuckling
because we're still here.
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I take the meetings here unless I'm traveling. I'm involved with
something else. So for all intents and purposes, as we're preparing.
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:56.000
It's the same. However, I will admit that when you all are in the
building quite naturally, you may want to stop by.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:02.000
So there is meeting a month whereby, you know, we don't have the
opportunity to work up until 5.
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:08.000
29 pm and log on so for all intents and purposes I would yield to board
office staff because they are preparing to accommodate this.
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:17.000
And I know as it relates to our colleague in the back from RTD, you know,
we have to have people on point and open up the building.
01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:28.000
So there are different elements, but we are a public agency, but we are a
public agency and we all signed up to be in public service, but we are a
public agency and we all signed up to be in public service.
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:41.000
So recognizing that we have been able to shoulder this as we move full
team ahead. So with that as context, the current configuration of the
model that we're utilizing works well for us.
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I do like the variation as relates to having a hybrid option. We get
greater participation for those that may need to juggle a multitude of
different responsibilities.
01:59:47.000 --> 02:00:03.000
So that is quite helpful. And I say that because John McCain was like,
oh, you should go home because I had an event last night at a meeting on
Monday and I have one tomorrow night and I have one tomorrow night.
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:11.000
So, but that's what I signed up for. So anyway, with that I'll yield the
floor to Mr. Kroll if you'd like to add insight from the board office.
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Thank you, Ms. Johnson. You know, I think the I wanna back up and give
credit actually.
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:23.000
You had mentioned I faced the issue with you, but I got to give credit to
Tai Shray who raised the issue with me to raise with you about this.
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:36.000
You know, too early to really say how this whole process is working, I
will say it's worked incredibly well.
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Too early to really say, how this whole process is working, I will say
it's worked incredibly well.
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:48.000

I don't know what it was like before. I came my background as you all
know being on the Board of Regents and so you we did all of our meetings
during the day they were 2 day long meetings.
02:00:48.000 --> 02:01:02.000
And, you know, would it be nice? Yeah. Because you asked my opinion to
meet during the day, but we have a reality here which is There's a lot of
people who work on this board and if you meet during the day it impacts
who can be on it.
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I to echo what the GM and CEO mentioned. I signed up for this job with
whatever you all want us to do, we will execute on it.
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:21.000
I will say the hybrid option is pretty well if I have a sense of my staff
is pretty well appreciated by the staff.
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Thank you for the comments. Any comment? Don't comment. Oh no, no, no, no
further.
02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:37.000
No, thank you for, I'm in favor of it. I like it, but yeah, I just thank
you for getting the staff input. I like it, but yeah, I just thank you
for getting the staff input.
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Thank you. You have something else, Mr. Cole? The only other thing that I
would ask for some direction on is we'll have to bring back a recommended
action.
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:58.000
The question I would ask you all to consider and perhaps the executive
committee can solicit input from their colleagues is in this action that
we might bring forward that will need to bring forward in 2,024.
02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Be set for just 2024 or should it set a longer time horizon? How often do
you anticipate wanting to revisit this conversation, how often do you
anticipate wanting to revisit this conversation effectively?
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Great, Mr. Guzman.
02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Thank you, Madam Chair. Would like to say I appreciate the format that we
have. Especially given certain opportunities that come up early in the
year.
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I wasn't able to be here for several of the board meetings. Due to the
civic academy with Dr.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Kog. And being able to join in afterwards while the meetings were still
going was really beneficial and helpful to be able to continue doing that
work.
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:56.000
I do appreciate being in person when it's possible, but I do also
understand, there are. It's flu season and COVID's on the rise and all of
those other wonderful things that we have to deal with, it may behoove us
to keep a virtual option.
02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:04.000
And I do see people engaging that may not otherwise be able to get down
here. Think about your districts and how far you travel.
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:15.000
I'm pretty close. So, you know, when you are the school teacher or the
breed still working until 5 o'clock and you have to catch the lift to
dash down here by 5 30 for the meeting.
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Sometimes it is great to be able to log in. Virtually and still be able
to participate and I think that's just the way of the world right now and
the modernization of the technology that we have so it provides us a
greater opportunity to expand it.
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000
That's my 2 cents. Thanks. Let me ask it this way. Is there anybody
opposing?
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Moving a similar policy forward for. 2024 that wants to address it or can
we. Stick with what we're doing in terms of the meetings that are in
person and the meetings that are.
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Zoom. Dr. W more. Just one thought on the two-year.
02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Idea might be beneficial if we could flush that out a bit because then
that would help us to you know, one of the other topics coming up is
recruitment for future board members.
02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:13.000
So people know what the job description is. Because sometimes you're a
little bit taken aback or surprised.
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:19.000
So it might be worth. I'm not saying let's do 2 years, but I think we
ought to think about it just for that very purpose.
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:27.000
You're talking about the membership on the committees. But no, I was
just, well, that could be part of it too, but having our.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Policy set that we will continue to do this hybrid approach for 2 years
as opposed to one.
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Yeah, I'm I didn't mean to say just 2,024. I mean, I think it could be 2
years.
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.000
It could be. This is our policy unless we decide to revisit it. Yeah, I
think so.
02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Did we just move this forward and stick with it? Director Kisdale? Thank
you very much, Madam Chair.
02:04:49.000 --> 02:05:05.000
I like the idea of having the hybrid option available. However, I do like
the in-person meetings and we did agree and this was based upon advice
that we had received from our staff.
02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:18.000
That the board meetings, the full board meetings, study sessions and so
forth would be held in person, but that the committee meetings would be
held strictly remotely.
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:26.000
I would like us to revisit that. I would like us to view the possibility
of having the committee meetings in person.
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:39.000
I do believe that all of the meetings should include a hybrid option. For
directors who have circumstances that arise that preclude their in person
attendance but they can participate.
02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:49.000
We had many directors at many times. Calling in from all parts of the
country and from hospital beds and otherwise to participate in these
meetings.
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:58.000
And that's wonderful to make that available to them. But I would like for
the able-bodied who can.
02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:05.000
For the committee meetings to be here in person. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Okay, well that's a big change.
02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:15.000
So that would take some further conversation. Any other conversation on
that? Director, okay. I am against that.
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:22.000

I just wanted to point that out. I feel like it's efficient just
respectively, again, as a full-time employee.
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I am against that. I think one meeting in person month is appropriate and
I think it's a great way to connect with one another but that's my
personal opinion I think it's the personal opinion again.
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Plenty of folks who this is a $12,000 type and you know I wish I could do
full-time with our being RT board member, but I just don't get paid
enough.
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:48.000
I do want to go back to Director Wetmore's point. I honestly think the
model that we have laid out.
02:06:48.000 --> 02:07:02.000
I think it's more than appropriate. To stick with that model unless said
otherwise because again, I considered it when I was running back in 2,020
of what the meeting schedule was and again going to recruiting new board
members.
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:12.000
That balance, you know, and understanding, hey, is this a time commitment
I could even do? Because if these were meetings that were happening in
the middle of the day, I would not have ran for this position, so.
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:22.000
I think that keeping with the schedule unless said otherwise going beyond
the 2,024 model I think is more than appropriate but that's where I lean
thank you.
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Okay, I'm gonna ask Dr. Davidson and director of room in just a second
but I was seeing some general head nodding.
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:36.000
For keeping the system that we have and then I tend to agree, you know,
we don't need to revisit this every year.
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:44.000
How are we with some head nods on just moving this forward as our general
policy and if we decide to revisit it.
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:52.000
We can bring that forward. Then turns this thumb up. I'm not closing off
the conversation.
02:07:52.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Director Davidson. Yeah, I just wanted to point out, I want to
acknowledge Director Tizale, the preference on it.
02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000

But I do want to point out one of the questions that's been on my mind is
just, you know, the nature of virtual meetings and I think.
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:20.000
When we all move forward in the pandemic, you know, the collective we
everywhere, we didn't know what we were up against and what to expect.
02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:25.000
And one of the questions on my mind is how efficient would we all be
virtually? And I do think that generally speaking our committee meetings
are efficient.
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:34.000
They go well. And it offers us an opportunity to have the different
medium and has the advantages that Director Bouquet brought up.
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:45.000
I think increasingly we can expect this model that new directors and new
folks coming in will expect this. Speaking in my private sector life, the
new folks coming in will expect this.
02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Speaking in my private sector life, the 2 boards in my private sector
were life that I currently work with now, the 2 boards in my private
sector were life that I currently work with now, some are in person and
some are virtual.
02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:14.000
And there are some things that are done more effectively in advantage of
the pros that Director Bouquet pointed out without any cons on those
committee meetings.
02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Thank you. Thank you, direct the room. Thank you, Madam Chair. The other
thing that I wonder.
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Remember to bring up was the. I thought it was a better idea to have the
Officers also have a two-year cycle.
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Is opposed to just one year because By the time they get acclimated,
particularly the chair. You know, they, their, their time is up and, Plus
the fact that you've got a voice and a face that you associate with a
organization.
02:09:52.000 --> 02:10:01.000
That way, otherwise it's just constant change going on over time. And
that would help fix this problem about.
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:14.000
The committee. Makeup. I think making sure that you get the people. To 2
years on like the finance committee or whatever.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000
As opposed to, you know, reshuffling the deck every year.
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Great. I think that I would like to put that under the our last bullet
point here, which is to ask.
02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:36.000
For people to believe briefly suggest topics for future board review. I
think that's a bigger discussion than we can have still.
02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Tonight, but I think it's a discussion that's worth having. Thanks. I'm
putting that in that in that corner right now.
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Director Guzman. Just really quickly about the the in person versus
hybrid meetings. There may be reasons that we do need to strive to have
in-person meetings.
02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:15.000
One of those being performance committee. We've already established that
and that is not a meeting that would be appropriate to have on a hybrid
situation for security reasons, but also because it's a human interaction
and a human review and that demands a different type of respect and
function within this body.
02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:25.000
For RGM CEO and so It is a that one is not up for debate, right? And I do
believe that there will be times when we as a body need to make that
determination.
02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:35.000
The chairs are imbued with that responsibility and maybe there will come
up, come an opportunity to be able to make that decision differently in
the future.
02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:41.000
But I think for all intents and purposes, none of us would want to be in
a room where somebody might get exposed to.
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:53.000
COVID, right? Like that's been a long term thing and so Offering those
options when we can but also being realistic and flexible when we need to
be and demanding of ourselves to say we need to show up.
02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:04.000
We need to show up as humans for another human in this role is really
important. So I see value in both of them, but I do think that this model
works for now and we can adjust as necessary when when we go forward.
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Thank you and the recommended action we passed that says unless otherwise
determined by the chair in consultation with the executive committee.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:18.000
And I think that's important to keep the performance committee meeting
that he's referring to once again November thirteenth at 5 30 p.
02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:31.000
M. We want everybody here that night unless you have COVID or another
very valid excuse. And I also wanted to say that if you're not coming to
an in-person meeting, I think most people do this, but please let.
02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Jack or me know. In advance so we know what to expect. I want to move on
pretty quickly from this, but go ahead. I just wanted to give Dr.
02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Guzman a here here on that for sure. And yeah, you mentioned what I was
going to mention that we have that in the committees and a good
opportunity for committee members to say this will be more efficient in
per in person or committee chairs rather. Thank you.
02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.000
And one other item I have on here that is just a reminder in that regard,
which is we have said we're not going to have December meetings or August
meetings with exceptions.
02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Again, we're going to be flexible, but one at least one of those this
year is again is going to be a performance committee meeting so we can
wrap that up.
02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:18.000
And so there will be. You know, at least that meeting in December. And
that's all we need on that topic.
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:43.000
One other quick topic I just wanted, I mentioned to some of you but you
know the thinking through the fact that we have 3 board members sadly
that are term-limited, Director Tisale, Director Williams and Director
Broome.
02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Know the discussion is back up as it comes up every. Fairly often in the
legislature and in the area about do we change the board.
02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:07.000
And, you know, the, my reaction to that is keep us in the conversation if
you're talking about changing the board and, Let's see where we are.
02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
What's the problem we're trying to solve? But really it's not necessarily
something we can control.
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:31.000

We can, you know, give our input, but we can't necessarily control. So my
view of that is with these 3 districts that we know I think let's set a
plan and a lot of this is up to you, the directors, but I think the board
office is game to help us and I'm game to help.
02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:43.000
I think the executive committee and others has come up with a plan for
having someone, whether it's you or, you know, someone, someone else from
the board going out to.
02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Whoever the chamber the economic development committee the local
environmental groups or the state environmental groups whoever and
starting to say, you know, help us recruit.
02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:10.000
We would appreciate you helping look for these things. And we can talk
about some of the areas that would be helpful, you know, public finance
experience, audit experience, people who ride the system.
02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:27.000
You know various various areas like that. But I think We don't know if
the legislature or anyone else will make a change, but I think we can
make sure that we are moving forward in a constructive way to.
02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:35.000
To replace very talented board members with hopefully. Nearly as talented
a board member. How's that?
02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:40.000
So, and we can get a plan where we just follow up with them. They may not
be inspired.
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:44.000
The chamber may say, oh yeah, we'd love to do it, but then put it on the
back burner, but maybe.
02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:50.000
They get a call from somebody else to remind them. So that's, I don't
even know if we need feedback on that tonight.
02:15:50.000 --> 02:16:02.000
I would like feedback on it generally. And, so that could come again to
Jack or to me or to, you know, others on the executive committee.
02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.000
See if we move that forward. Other specific policies. Thank you, Director
Broome for the one you raised.
02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:26.000
I would mention that the expense policy, thank you to the board office
for the good work on that. It is coming forward as a discussion item and
that's something that we've also been working on is to bring Big changes,

and many of our changes were for a simple board is discussion items
before they come as recommended actions.
02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:39.000
And I think everybody has been liking that. So if the other specific
policies anybody would want to suggest now, this is an open-ended
question that, I mean, there certainly are other ones that you can bring
to the.
02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.000
To us in the in the near future. But
02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:48.000
That's a final question, the final finale. Well, we'll see if you have
other matters, but.
02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Anything else? We got enough. Good enough. Alright.
02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Any other matters for this board?
02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Alright, I'll attend and entertain a motion to adjourn. Alright, we are
adjourned.
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Thanks everybody.
02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Thank you. Thanks. Got a little later than I went. Working out first.
02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:35.000
That still can get to bed on the right time schedule. Thank you. Okay.
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:47.000
It'd be interesting to sit in on some of the meetings of the Broncos. We
make our meetings that last till midnight. It seemed pretty easy,
wouldn't it?
02:17:47.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I would think so. That's where it is. Yeah, writing that
