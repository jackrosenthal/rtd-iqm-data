BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Fall 2023 Governance Study Session

October 18, 2023

BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Lynn Guissinger, Chair, RTD Board
PRESENTATION LENGTH
2 hours
BACKGROUND
As no formal action can be taken during the Study Session, the aim of the session is to get Director
feedback to directionally inform the development of future Recommended Actions. The Board’s
consideration on the topics for discussion will help to hone the Board’s Bylaws, Operating Guidelines,
and policies.
Effective governance is a primary pursuit of the RTD Board of Directors. Continuous transparent
discussion and review of Board practices and policies contributes to the Board’s overarching goal of
having a high-functioning governing body.
The primary goal of the Study Session is to solicit open, honest, and transparent feedback from Board
members on the agenda topics, which were selected for their timely relevance and capacity to improve
the Board’s effectiveness.
DISCUSSION
The initial discussions will task Board members to provide input on the following topics related to the
Board’s committees and Bylaws:
Informal meetings of three or more directors
The length of Board and Board committee meetings
A plan to review the Board’s Bylaws and key policies over the coming months
The development of standing committee workplans
The Board’s current committee structure
The length of Board member appointments to certain standing committees
Following the discussions above, the Board will be asked to discuss best practices related to:
How to effectively engage with staff within the context of their work plans and resources
Effective meeting management
Next, the Board will be asked to share ideas on how to best raise awareness around elections for Board
of Director seats and how to help cultivate a diverse pool of candidates.
The discussion will conclude with a conversation around what Board policies and practices, not listed on
the Study Session’s agenda, the Board wishes to discuss in the future.

Bylaws Amendment — Director Informal Meeting Process

September 22, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
April 25, 2023

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by RTD Directors Dishell, Guissinger, and Sloan that the Board of Directors amend
Article IV of the Bylaws of the Regional Transportation District to establish a procedure for informal
meetings to engage in discussions of public business with three or more Board members in addition to
regular Board, special Board, Standing committee, and Ad Hoc Committee meetings.
REPRESENTATIVE
Directors Dishell, Guissinger, and Sloan
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The proposal is intended to complement the regular structure of Board meetings by affording Directors
an option to schedule flexible and adaptable meetings when three or more members consider them to be
necessary or desirable. The purposes of such meetings include preparing a matter to bring to the Board,
discussing working relationships with stakeholders and constituents, or considering other matters related
to agency business. The scheduling Directors must provide the meeting agenda, including any materials,
the time, and location of the meeting to the Executive Manager of the Board Office and the Board Chair
at least forty-eight hours prior to the meeting. Notice of the meetings will be posted on the Board’s
online two-week calendar. Written minutes shall be recorded.
Like all Board meetings, the informal meetings will comply with applicable laws, particularly the Colorado
Open Meetings Law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Board Office staff may not be present and
informal meetings will not be broadcasted via Zoom or video recorded, nor will a written transcript be
prepared.
DISCUSSION
The proposal can encourage useful discussion of nascent issues as well as improve the presently
cumbersome and inefficient process for more-than-three-Director initiatives. If the Bylaw amendments
are adopted, Directors will be authorized to develop agendas and choose locations suitable to the
discussion topic. Blake Street will remain as a location available to Directors who wish to utilize RTD's IT

The purposes of such meetings may include discussion of a matter to bring to the Board, relationships
with stakeholders and constituents, or other matters related to agency business. No formal action may
be taken. The Directors calling the meeting may set the location and agenda as appropriate to the topic
of the meeting. Written minutes shall be recorded.
Additionally, a new subsection is to be added to Section 8(c): Notice of Meetings.
NOTICE OF MEETINGS
c) The scheduling Directors must provide the meeting agenda, including any materials, the time, and
location of the meeting to the Executive Manager of the Board Office and the Board Chair at least fortyeight hours prior to the meeting.

Committee Meeting Date:
Proposed Bylaw Amendment to Set a Time Limit on Board
Meetings

September 21, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager of the Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the Executive Committee meeting held on July 20, 2023, the committee discussed the merits of
setting a limit or fixed end time on Board meetings. There was consensus that the idea was worth
further exploration and strong consideration. The Board Office and Directors have conducted research
looking to other Colorado local governmental entities on practices around setting limits on the length of
Board meetings. Additionally, the Board Office sought input from internal stakeholders on the
advantages and disadvantages of limiting the length of Board meetings. Based on the research
conducted and the input received, a proposed Bylaw amendment is now coming forward as a discussion
item.
DISCUSSION
The proposed Bylaw amendment would be to add the below language to Article IV (Meetings), Section 8
(Recesses and Adjournments)
Article IV (Meetings), Section 8 (Recesses and Adjournments):
Once four hours have elapsed following the call to order of a meeting, all regular, special and
committee meetings of the Board of Directors shall be adjourned at the conclusion of the agenda item
under consideration, unless the Board votes to extend the meeting’s length. A meeting may be
extended by a majority vote of present and voting members. Should there be a vote to extend the
meeting, such a vote must affix the time certain to adjourn. Any remaining action items on the agenda
at the time of adjournment will automatically carry forward to the next meeting of the Board or
respective committee.
The next steps in the process to amend this Bylaw are to:
1) Discuss and consider any proposed amendments during the Executive Committee meeting
scheduled for September 21, 2023
2) Solicit feedback and input from the full Board
3) Revise the proposed Bylaw amendment as appropriate based on the feedback received

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM

4) Send to the full Board the exact language of the proposed Bylaw amendment no later than10days prior to the October Board meeting (Article XV Modification of Bylaws)
5) Any amendment voted on at the October Board meeting would require 10 votes to pass (Article
XV Modification of Bylaws)
This proposed amendment, if adopted, aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and
Customer Excellence by expanding the level of public access provided to Board meetings. Further, if
adopted, this proposed Bylaw update aligns with the Strategic Priority of Employee Ownership by
affording the Board and staff who attend regularly the meetings of the Board a greater ability to plan for
their commitments. And, lastly, if adopted, this change would impact the Strategic Priority of Financial
Success, by potentially reducing the costs associated with hosting and producing Board meetings.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Capping the length of Board meetings could reduce costs for staff overtime, contracted production
services, security overtime, and interpretation and translation services.

Fort Collins, CO City Council
Every regular Council meeting will end no later than midnight, except that: (1) any item of business
commenced before midnight may be concluded before the meeting is adjourned and (2) the Council may, at
any time prior to adjournment, by majority vote, extend a meeting beyond midnight for the purpose of
considering additional items of business. Any matter that has been commenced and is still pending at the
conclusion of the Council meeting, and all matters scheduled for consideration at the meeting that have not yet
been considered by the Council, will be deemed continued to the next regular Council meeting, unless Council
determines otherwise.

Golden, CO City Council
All meetings shall adjourn no later than 10 p.m., or as soon thereafter as the hour may be brought to the
attention of the chair, except that upon a majority vote of those councilors present meeting, such meeting may
be extended to 10:30 p.m. Meetings may be extended past 10:30 p.m. only upon the adoption of a motion to
suspend the rules, which requires a majority vote of all councilors. The vote on any such suspension shall be
entered upon the record. When making a motion to suspend the rules, the councilor shall specify the rule or
part thereof to be suspended and the purpose for such suspension.

Boulder, CO City Council
The council's goal is that all meetings be adjourned by 10:30 p.m. An agenda check will be conducted at or
about 9:00 p.m., and no later than at the end of the first item finished after 9:00 p.m. Generally, absent a
deadline which the council cannot affect, no new substantial item will be addressed after 10:30 p.m. At the
9:00 p.m. agenda check council will make a realistic assessment of the items remaining on the agenda.
Council will table and ask the Council Agenda Committee to reschedule any item that council members
reasonably believe will prevent adjournment by 10:30 p.m. The Debrief is not a substantial item. No new
item shall be introduced after 10:30 p.m. unless a majority of the council members in attendance at that
time agree. All council meetings shall be adjourned at or before 11:00 p.m., unless the meeting is extended
by a vote of two-thirds of the council members present. Council shall attempt to schedule any matter not
heard before adjournment as the first item at the next study session. If necessary, the council shall schedule
a special meeting to coincide with the scheduled study session. It is assumed that council will reschedule
items previously scheduled for the study session to accommodate any newly added items.

Longmont, CO City Council
In order to facilitate the convenience of the public and Council, whenever practicable, it shall be the policy of
Council to adjourn at 11:00 P.M., and that items not under present consideration be continued and not be called for
consideration after such hour.

An Historical Note
By Director Tisdale
Attached hereto is a summary sheet and associated charts prepared by the Board
Office Staff summarizing RTD Board Bylaws amendments from 2004 through 2010. The
following is intended to be a narrative summary of the information contained in those
documents. (For context, there have been no changes in the RTD Board Bylaws regarding
the membership on standing committees since 2007.)
Prior to 2007, the RTD Board of Directors appears to have had five Standing
Committees plus an Executive Committee, each of which had a limited number of
members on such committee. The total of six committees were Administrative/Finance;
Operations/Customer Service/Marketing; Planning and Development; Contracted Services
(added in 2005); and the Executive Committee. These were as established in the RTD
Board Bylaws.
In 2007 there was a sea change in committee structure. The critical change in the
Bylaws was to establish five standing committees as “Committees of the Whole,” meaning
that each Director was by definition, and without need of appointment by the Chair, a
member of such standing committee.
The five standing committees of the whole established by the Bylaws in 2007 were
articulated as: Financial Administration; FasTracks; Legislative; Operations/Customer
Service/Marketing; and Planning. The Executive Committee was not changed in these
2007 Bylaw amendments. At some point after 2007, Civil Rights was added as a standing
committee, and FasTracks was merged into the Planning Committee. Some of these
changes were apparently motivated by the 2010 State Audit.
At the same time, there were certain other committees of the Board, which were not
committees of the whole. These are shown in the attached summary sheet.
As nearly as we can reconstruct, the reason for shifting from committees with limited
membership to committees of the whole was driven by a sense that Directors who were not
members of various committees were “left out” and “not a part of” important decisions being
made by these committees. It is a situation that is sometimes referred to as “government
by the elites.”
The 2010 State Audit at p. 58 noted that committees of the whole “can be useful as a
means of accomplishing certain aspects of the Board’s business…, [affording] every member
the opportunity to be involved in standing committee’s business, thereby providing for more
open participation by Board members, greater information sharing and expeditied
decisionmaking. However, given the potential disadvantages [undermining the efficiencies
gained by having a division of labor and not developing subject-matter expertise], the Board
should reevaluate its use of the committee of the whole as the primary means of organizing
[committees].” The Board did make some changes to committee structure in response to

RTD Ad Hoc Committee on Committee Structure

the report (added GMOC, added Civil Rights, added Audit), but did not adjust the general
approach of committees of the whole.
So, for 13 years the RTD Bylaws have provided for committees of the whole for five
standing committees.
The question presented to the Ad Hoc Committee is whether it would be advisable to
alter the composition of the standing committees that was established and incorporated
into the RTD Board Bylaws in 2007. A more complete statement of this committee’s charge
is found in the Committee Charter. The reason for the issuance of this charge, as stated in
the Charter, is sentiment that committees of the whole may lead to inefficiencies and
overly long meetings.
