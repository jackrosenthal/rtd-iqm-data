RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the RTD Service Standards as revised July 2016, thereby adopting the updated policies and
standards as included in Attachment B.
BACKGROUND
RTD has had service standards in place since 1987, which have provided a rational, equitable and
sustainable approach to developing and evaluating all its services for the benefit of the District’s
constituents as a whole. The last revision was adopted in 2002 and in 2008 RTD commissioned our
Service Development consultant to provide a thorough review of our standards in relation to transit
industry peers.
DISCUSSION
Many changes have occurred in our industry as well as to RTD needs since 2002. The acquisition of
automatic vehicle location and passenger counting has provided a profusion of valuable data for
improved analytics and reporting, such as better measurements for on-time performance and crowding.
Our Geographic Information System is used to illustrate service classification and the effects of service
changes on Access-a-Ride customers. Consideration of FTA regulations for Tile VI and Environmental
Justice are now expressly incorporated into the Standards. To address the diverse needs of the RTD
constituencies, RTD has developed guidelines regarding shuttles and circulators as well as a cost sharing
policy. In addition, recommendations have been incorporated into the revised standards for: the service
classification system; new service warrants; service design and performance standards; demandresponsive transit; and standards for transit-dependent riders.
These and other revisions developed since 2002 were vetted with extensive involvement of RTD Service
Development, Engineering and Planning Technical Services staff. In 2015 RTD invited review and
comment from our stakeholders and held several meetings with all those representatives who were
interested (about a dozen). As a result a number of revisions were incorporated into the document,
although some that require much more extensive analysis were postponed for future consideration.
Attachment A provides highlights of the revisions.
FINANCIAL IMPACTS
No direct financial impacts are incurred with the adoption of this update to current policy. Financial
impacts will be determined by the actual application of these standards.

Highlights of Revisions to the Transit Service Policies & Standards
The following follows the Table of Contents of the document.
1. Introduction
Due to the implementation of FasTracks and resulting service restructuring, the routes
in the Express, Regional and SkyRide service classes are reassigned into either the
Regional class or the Local CBD class based on the length of the non-stop portion of
the route. Also the Urban classification is now specifically defined as having 35% or
more of route length within a ¼ mile buffer with population+employment density of
12 per acre or greater; and Suburban class with 34% or less.
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
Rail and Enhanced Bus (BRT) minimums were added to the table of minimum
frequencies.
2.3.3 Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard
From the latest customer and industry research, RTD now defines the amount of
crowding on a route as the percent of total trips during a defined time period that
exceed the comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3 square feet per standee (level-ofservice D and E).
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
A new section was added summarizing US DOT requirements for ADA complementary
paratransit for individuals who cannot readily access the RTD bus and rail system.
2.5 Reliability
A new section was added defining on-time for fixed-route service as not more than 1
minute early to not more than 5 minutes late.
3.3 Roadway Design Goal
This now references the Engineering staff’s Bus Transit Facilities document, Transit
Access section.
4. Shelters
A new section was added defining the minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter
as 40 boardings per day at a stop.
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Call-n-Ride is included as an appropriate service for areas with 3 - 12
population+employment per acre.
5.2.2 Maximum Target Service levels
This section was deleted as not needed.
5.2.2 Access-A-Ride - ADA Required Service Area Coverage
A new section was added summarizing the FTA requirements for ADA complementary
paratransit services.
6. Transit Access
A new section was added referencing the Engineering staff’s Bus Transit Facilities
document, Transit Access section.
7.2 Standards for Events
The paragraph that “RTD may also provide service at events with lower attendance
projections if the promoter is willing to subsidize such service” is deleted. This is
charter service and not permitted by FTA.
8. Shuttles & Circulators

Packet Pg. 7

Attachment: Atch A - Highlights of Revisions to Transit Service Policies & Standards (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)

A new section was added that provides guidelines and requirements to stakeholders in
local communities who would like to develop such services. It addresses such
characteristics as population density, major activity centers, transit friendly
environment, minimum service levels and fares.
10. Title VI Compliance
A new section was added that RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI
Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter
4.4.
12. Service Change Process
A new section was added describing the typical runboard process for analyzing,
proposing and implementing service changes.
13. Cost Sharing Policy
A new section was added detailing this policy that facilitates partnerships with RTD to
demonstrate new or expanded services using funds obtained from grants and
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments. The
guidance outlines financial feasibility, vehicle availability, local government and
community support and performance requirements.

2.11.A.b

1. Introduction

RTD continually receives requests for changes to existing service and for new service in
growing areas of the District. Additionally, RTD may be operating some services that are
not attracting enough riders to justify their cost. In order to be consistent in the
evaluation of service proposals, and to ensure that the service being provided represents
the most cost-effective use of the District's resources, a set of service standards is
maintained by RTD.
The specific standards, targets or minimum/maximum values for the standards, and a
procedure for applying these standards, are presented in this document. Since service
standards are intended to optimize usage of the District's resources, they are updated
periodically to reflect changes in the District goals and resources. The procedure for
updating the standards is described in Section 1.3.

1.2 Application of Service Standards
There are two primary applications for the ongoing use of the service standards. These
are the use of standards to evaluate existing services, and use of standards to evaluate
proposals for new service.
The application of standards to existing routes is a flexible process. The purpose of the
standards is to help identify routes which are most in need of service changes, such as
restructuring to eliminate lower productivity segments or branches, adjusting service
frequency to better reflect the demand for service, or providing additional promotion of
less patronized routes where appropriate. Routes, which do not meet standards, are not
automatically designated for elimination. Elimination of routes is only intended as a last
resort, when it has been determined that no cost-effective actions are available to improve
the productivity of the route.
The standards for evaluation of existing routes are not intended to preclude changes to
routes that meet these minimum standards. In many cases, it may be possible to improve
the productivity of routes that meet the minimum standards by making changes to
headways or trip times. Since the overall mission of RTD is “To meet our constituents’
present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous,
accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District,” these standards should not
be used to prevent changes to improve the efficiency of existing routes, as long as the
changes meet the route design standards.
The availability of financial resources, represented by the annual budget, is the bottom line
for these standards. Service expansion may occur when additional funds are available and
contraction may occur otherwise. In any case, selection of which services to provide or
curtail is based on these performance standards and no service is considered guaranteed

Packet Pg. 12

Attachment: Atch B - Service Standards Final (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)

1.1 Overview

Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.b

The evaluation of new service proposals will take place as proposals are received or needs
identified. The most recent values of the standards for existing routes will be used to
evaluate the proposed new services. Decisions regarding implementation of new routes
will be made through the service planning process. New routes and services will be
expected to meet all applicable design standards described in Sections 2, 3 and 55, but
will not be expected to meet the productivity standards described in Section 2.3.2.1 until
they have been in operation for at least six months. Demonstration, experimental, and
cost sharing services are also handled in this manner.

1.3 Updating of Service Standards
The service standards are intended to support the goals and objectives of the District.
Since these objectives and the resources available to attain them can be expected to
change over time, the standards will be revised periodically to reflect those changes.
The service standards will be reviewed on a bi-annual basis. At that time, experience
with the service standards over the previous time period, as well as changes in the
District's goals and objectives, will be used to determine whether any standards should be
added or revised.
The numerical values of productivity standards will be updated each year, using ridership,
revenue and cost figures for the most recent twelve-month period for which data are
available. The rankings are based only on those routes that existed for the entire year.
Routes which were eliminated during the year will not be included because they cannot be
identified as candidates for revisions. Routes that were introduced during the year will not
be included in determining the new standards since they are not required to meet the
productivity standards until they have been in operation for at least six months. However,
these routes will be evaluated separately, using the service standards contained in this
document.
The updating procedure will compare the values of the productivity standards with those
in effect for the previous year. Operating cost data for the previous year will be revised to
account for system-wide increases or decreases in operating cost.

2. Performance Standards
2.1

Derivation and Use of Standards

The productivity standards are used to identify routes and services for appropriate
marketing and possible revision or elimination. Separate standards are identified for each
class of service. Routes are evaluated on ridership (either boardings per in-service hour or
per trip, depending on the class of service) and on the economic measure of subsidy per
passenger. These standards are based on the performance of the least productive 10
percent of the routes in each service class for either the ridership or economic measure, or

Revised July 14, 2016

Packet Pg. 13

Attachment: Atch B - Service Standards Final (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)

or beyond review. The RTD Board of Directors, with input from RTD staff and the public,
is responsible for making decisions on service recommendations.

Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.b

New services should meet the applicable standards for their class of service after six
months of operation. All new services will be reviewed after six months of operation and
routes that have not shown adequate progress toward meeting the standards will be
targeted for cost-effective actions to increase productivity or for elimination.

To meet the RTD mission to provide cost-effective service throughout the District, RTD
has developed different types or classes of service that serve specific markets and,
therefore, have different performance expectations. Due to their different service
characteristics Express, Regional and SkyRide were treated as separate classes. However,
due to the deployment of rail, BRT and resulting service restructuring, these classes are
reconfigured. The routes in these three are reassigned into a new, consolidated Regional
class or the Local CBD class. Regional class includes routes providing high-speed service
on limited access highways from suburban and outlying communities to downtown
Denver, Denver International Airport and other metro, major employment centers, and
provided at distances of approximately 6 miles or more. Local services have three subclassifications: CBD—any route serving downtown Denver; Urban—35% or more of route
length within a ¼ mile buffer has population+employment density of 12 per acre or
greater; and Suburban—34% or less. Call-n-Ride and Access-a-Ride are separate classes.
Enhanced bus and BRT routes may warrant future consideration regarding their operation
with: dedicated right-of-way; partially dedicated ROW; limited or express mode; priority
over other traffic; and various speeds appropriate to context. [Please see attachment A
Service Classes for details on how these revisions affect current routes.]
The standards for evaluating portions of routes are intended for use in identifying needed
service improvements, for making modifications to specific portions of existing routes, or
for identifying low productivity segments of routes.
These standards could be used in situations such as isolating low productivity portions of
otherwise productive routes or measuring options for bringing unproductive routes into
compliance with the overall service standards. These standards may also be used to
evaluate proposals for new route extensions or deviations on existing routes.

2.2 Ridership and Economic Measures
The RTD’s approach is to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel
markets. All services are designed to match the level of service with demand, thus
improving performance and sustainability. This results in multiple domains of acceptable
performance for the various classes of service. Standards are best set by first determining
measures of performance and objectives. The core objective is to maximize overall
ridership, to the extent allowed by the available resources.
2.2.1 Performance Objective

Attachment: Atch B - Service Standards Final (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)

on the least productive 25 percent of routes in both measures. The basis for the
standards will be reviewed in conjunction with the cost recovery standards in Section 99,
and may be revised if necessary.

Service Development Policies & Standards

Service allocation is driven by the RTD adopted mission statement: “To meet our
constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible cost-effective service throughout the District.”
Performance Measures
 Passengers/hour (productivity)
 Passengers/trip (Regional class productivity)
 Subsidy/passenger (cost effectiveness)
The subsidy per passenger measure combines fare revenue and total cost impacts to
produce a measure that comprehensively reflects the District’s allocation of resources. The
effectiveness-productivity chart, Error! Reference source not found., presents economic
effectiveness on the vertical axis, and
productivity, or boardings per hour, on the
horizontal axis.
The chart offers a
convenient comparative analysis of all
classes of services, illustrating both
absolute and relative performance. When
standards and guidelines are applied,
judgments can be made.

2.3 Fixed Route Service Design and
Evaluation Standards
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
New routes shall provide the minimum
Figure 1 Effectiveness - Productivity Chart
frequencies specified below. Existing
services that cannot meet these minimum standards while adhering to the minimum
passengers per hour or trip standards defined in Section 2.3.2 shall be identified as
candidates for service changes or appropriate marketing promotion within available
resources. These service changes may include providing service with longer headways if
no other viable alternative exists. Elimination of the route may be considered if service
changes and/or promotional efforts do not improve productivity.
These are “policy” service levels and represent a compromise between economic
efficiency and the functionality of the system. To be sustained at these levels, a route
must meet the minimum ridership performance standards discussed in Section 2.3.2.1 and
annual calculated standards. Routes providing frequencies higher than the policy minimum
must be justified by ridership demand as outlined in Section 2.3.4.
The following table indicates the minimum frequency standard for types of service and
time of day by corridor (multiple routes sharing a segment).

2.3.2 Minimum Ridership Performance
This standard applies to routes operating at the minimum service frequency target. For
Local and Limited routes, the standard is passengers per hour based upon the bottom 10%
and 25% of routes in the respective class. For Regional, and SkyRide routes, the standard
is passengers per trip.
These standards are derived from system averages by class of service. All routes must
meet their applicable minimum standards. Those that do not meet these standards will
need to be modified or marketed in some way in order to bring them up to the minimum
standards. Those that are not brought up to the minimum standards are subject to
cancellation. Routes that meet their applicable minimum ridership standards justify a
service level at the minimum service frequencies outlined in Section 2.3.1. Higher
frequencies must be justified by ridership as outlined in Section 2.3.4.
2.3.2.1

Performance Standards

These measures and the effectiveness-productivity for all routes and services and the class
10% and 25% standards are calculated annually and are provided separately at

Documents—Performance Reports.
2.3.2.2 Specific Trips Ridership Standards
The standard for evaluating specific trips on a route varies by time of day as shown in the
following table. For reference see the last column of Attachment C Regional Bus Service
Performance. Trips must have boardings of at least the specified percentage of the
minimum boardings standard for the time period of the trip, as defined in Table 2

Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard

From the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual: “From the passenger
perspective, the passenger load on a transit vehicle affects the comfort of the on-board
vehicle portion of a transit trip-both in terms of being able to find a seat and in overall
crowding levels within the vehicle. From a transit operator's perspective, a poor quality of
service may indicate the need to increase service frequency or vehicle size to reduce
crowding and increase passenger comfort.”
RTD defines crowding as a seated load plus the standing passenger space, as calculated
for each vehicle by subtracting the area occupied by seats and other objects from the
gross interior floor area. The amount of crowding on a route is defined as the percent of
total trips during a defined time period that exceed a comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3
square feet per standee, generally having these characteristics (See page 5-24 of the
Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, 3rd Edition,
http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_165ch-05.pdf):
 Standing load without body contact
 Standees have similar amount of personal space as seated passengers
 Reasonably easy circulation within vehicle
The maximum number of standees can be computed for each vehicle by determining its
standing passenger square footage and dividing by 4.3—5.3. For any service class during
any defined period (e.g., AM early, AM peak, midday), when 10% or more of the
directional trips exceed the computed maximum standees at the maximum load point,
further investigation of potential remedies, such as changing the bus assignment or
frequency of service, is warranted. For special events heavier loads are expected and
acceptable, but when 10% or more of trips during the take-away have 4 or less square
feet per standing passenger, further investigation of potential remedies is warranted. See
Attachment D Crowding Report Examples for reference. The Percent of Total Trips chart
(lower right) with level-of-service D or E would indicate crowding.

2.11.A.b

Service Development Policies & Standards

Service frequency in the RTD network is based on clock-pattern schedules. This pattern
provides consistent and easy to understand schedules for our customers, and makes
possible the provision of timed transfer connection hubs, whereby multiple routes are
scheduled to meet at one location to facilitate connections. In general, routes are
scheduled to operate in even increments of 30 minutes, or every 60, 30, 15, 10, 7.5, or 5
minutes. However, other frequencies may be provided depending upon passenger
demand, or operational and scheduling needs.
For routes meeting the above frequency, ridership, and load standards, frequency better
than every 30 minutes may be provided when and where justified by ridership. This
standard applies equally to all service categories. In order to be sustainable, higher
frequency service must meet the following criteria:






Incremental frequency necessary to maintain the appropriate load standard during any
30 minute time period.
Appropriate vehicle assignment as outlined in Section 2.3.5
When a service exceeds the maximum load standard, higher frequency may be justified
during that time period and/or route segment.
If a service with better than the minimum frequency has passenger loads that can be
accommodated with a lower frequency without violating the load standard, then
frequency may be reduced.
As a general guideline, a typical productivity by service frequency, for a whole route or
a segment or time period is provided in Table 3 Demand Based Service Frequency

2.3.6 Design and Evaluation of Portions of Routes
The standards for evaluating portions of routes cover two areas in which minor
modifications may be made to routes without changing the overall structure of the route:
 midline segments or midline deviations

branches or end segments

The governing standards for overall route productivity were presented earlier. Since trips
provided during marginally productive hours of the day or trips over marginal segments
often increase the attractiveness of the overall service, an otherwise productive route may
be able to support some less productive trips or portions of the route. However, if a route
cannot meet the overall service standards for its class of service, there may not be
productive segments to enhance the unproductive segments. Therefore, specific
segments, branches, or trips which meet the standards for portions of routes may still be
modified in order to raise the productivity of the entire route, if the overall route does not
meet the service standards for its class of service.
2.3.6.1 Midline Segments and Midline Deviations




A midline segment or deviation of a Local or Limited route should generate enough
boardings per hour of service provided to meet the standard for its class of service
(CBD, Urban and Suburban). Boardings in both directions will be counted.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause a reduction in the overall boardings
per hour for the route.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause the route to violate any route design
standards as defined in Section 2.3, or the overall productivity standards as defined in
Section 2.

2.3.6.2 Branches and End Segments









A branch or end segment of a Local or Limited route should generate enough boardings
to meet the ridership standard for its class of service (CBD, Urban and Suburban).
Boardings generated along the branch are defined as all passengers boarding the bus
along the branch or end portion of the route, and all outbound passengers alighting
along this section.
Local collector portions of Regional routes which meet the following maximum travel
time standard, shall meet the ridership productivity standard for the entire route. This
maximum travel time is equal to 15 minutes or 50 percent of line haul travel time,
whichever is less.
For shorter segments, the minimum ridership standard is reduced by the ratio of actual
travel time to the maximum allowable travel time. Thus, if the actual travel time along
the collector is half of the maximum allowed, it must average half the number of
boardings per trip specified in the minimum ridership productivity standard.
A new extension to a route that does not meet the minimum ridership productivity
standard must attract sufficient ridership for the entire route to meet the minimum
ridership standard for its service class.
A route extension will not be initiated if it violates any of the route design standards
found in Section 2.3, or causes the route as a whole to fall below the minimum riders
per unit of service or standards found earlier in Section 2.3.2.

2.11.A.b

Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.b

RTD continues to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel markets.
The goal of this approach is to match the type and level of service to the demand in a
given service area, thus improving performance and sustainability. As such, a variety of
non-fixed route services are provided by the RTD including the following.
2.4.1 Call-n-Ride
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive Call-n-Ride
service is characterized as a shared ride within a defined geographic service area and the
need for the passenger to arrange for pick-up in advance or be at a designated checkpoint
at prescheduled times. A Call-n-Ride service area averages about 7 square miles or
between about 2 to 30 square miles depending on its number of vehicles and service
configuration—predominantly station feeder or community-based service. Call-n-Ride often
provides first/last mile access to the broader RTD network of services through timed
connections at transfer centers and Park-n-Rides. Population plus employment is 3 to 12
persons per acre. Call-n-Ride service is evaluated based on passenger boardings per
revenue hour and subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
Access-a-Ride provides ADA complementary paratransit in the District to individuals who
cannot readily access the bus and rail system. As per US DOT requirements the
passenger’s trip origin and destination must be within ¾ mile of RTD’s non-commuter bus
route system, during the same days and hours of their operation and within the District
boundaries, and curb-to-curb service must be provided. However, RTD provides door-todoor service as a reasonable accommodation. Trips must be booked at least one day and
up to 3 days in advance; however, RTD also offers subscriptions.
All applicants must qualify for certification under the guidelines established by the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, complete a functional evaluation in person,
provide a physician’s statements to verify disability and must meet one of the following
criteria:
 Be unable to get to and from a bus stop or on and off a lift-equipped bus by yourself
 Have a cognitive disability that prohibits your understanding of how to complete bus
trips
2.4.3 Vanpooling
Vanpooling is a public transportation option in which commuters, whose residences are
geographically clustered, ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically vanpools make one roundtrip per day and
carry from 5 to 14 riders. Vanpooling offers greater opportunities for increased capacity
compared to carpooling and offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit in
areas of low employment density and longer commute distances. RTD contracts for this

service with DRCOG to subsidize the portion of the commute trip within the District.
Vanpool service is evaluated based on subsidy per passenger boarding.

SeniorRide Special Events transports groups to a variety of cultural, educational and
entertainment events. The Schedule of events is published 3 times a year to the public.
Service is available on a first come first served basis. A minimum of 10 passengers per
trip is required. Scheduled events that do not generate reservations of at least 2 groups of
10 may be reconsidered as to whether or not to schedule such event(s) during the next 12
months.
SeniorShopper buses have established routes that provide trips to major grocery stores.
Service is available Monday through Friday. A minimum of 10 passengers per trip is
required.

2.5 Reliability
On-time for fixed-route service is defined as not more than 1 minute early to not more than
5 minutes late. RTD sets annual objectives for on-time performance by class of service
and which are reported in the Quarterly Performance Report. [Improved methods for
monitoring, identifying the causes and remedying unreliable service are currently in
development.]

3. Geometric Design Standards
3.1 Directness of Route
Routes shall be designed to be as direct as possible and to provide maximum accessibility
to transit.
 Deviations from a direct path from end-to-end of the route shall account for no more
than one-quarter of the end-to-end travel time of the route.


For a specific deviation, the total additional travel time for all through passengers
should not exceed three minutes for each rider boarding or alighting along the
deviation.
In mathematical terms, this means that the quantity
Pt * VTT < 3 minutes
Pd
where: Pt = through passengers
VTT = additional vehicle one-way travel time
Pd = passengers served by deviation

Bus routes shall adhere to the following stop spacing standards. Placement also
considers: the balance between pedestrian access and route travel time; ADA
requirements; adjacent land uses; streetscape conditions and property ownership.

Limited service, residential and commercial areas – 1,250’ (4 stops/mile)
Limited service, limited stop zone – 8,000’ (1 stop/1.5 miles)

3.3 Roadway Design Goal
New bus routes should not be operated along streets that do not meet minimum
standards, such as for bus turning radius, pavement strength/loading, lane width, roadway
grade, shoulder width on rural roads (for pedestrian waiting and safety) and overhead
clearance. Refer to the RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria Section 1 –
Transit Access for specific details.

4. Shelters
The minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter is 40 boardings per day at the stop.
Stops with the highest average of daily boardings will take top priority for shelter
placement. [Revised standards are currently in development and will reference the RTD
Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria.]

5. Area Coverage Standards
5.1 Purpose and Application
The purpose of these standards is to define a reasonable level of service to all areas of the
District and to help RTD maintain this service level. Since the RTD service area includes
many different types of development, and population densities and land use vary widely
across the District, it would not be reasonable to expect all areas to support the same level
of service. Moreover, different types of service may best meet the needs of different
areas, and RTD's resources can be used in a more productive fashion if service can be
tailored to the needs of particular areas. Area coverage standards provide guidelines for
tailoring service to the needs of communities and help ensure that all areas receive a level
of service that is commensurate with their needs.
Levels of service for specific areas also depend on the productivity of existing services. If
existing or proposed services cannot meet the productivity standards outlined in Section 2,

Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.b

RTD may choose not to provide the minimum level of service. Financial constraints may
also limit RTD's ability to meet the area coverage (or any other) standards.

The area coverage standards for areas outside the Denver Central Business District (CBD)
are based on a combined density measure. This measure adds population and employment
to determine potential demand for transportation to and from a particular area.
[Attachment B shows the density classifications overlaid with RTD services for the entire
District.]
The area coverage standards presented below deal with route spacing. Actual route
spacing and service frequency will depend on demand and productivity of existing service
in the area.
For use in this document, arterial roadways are defined as follows:
 Traffic flow controlled by traffic signals as opposed to stop signs
 Carry longer distance traffic flow
 Speed limit 30 mph or faster
 Road width two plus lanes in each direction
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre
 Peak period Park-n-Ride service if either the travel time to the Denver CBD by Express
bus or rail, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.
 Call-n-Ride service.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
 Local service on major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
 Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from Park-n-Rides if either the travel
time to the Denver CBD by bus, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.

radius at the ends of each fixed route.
(ii) Within the core service area, the entity also shall provide service to small areas
not inside any of the corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.
(iii) Outside the core service area, the entity may designate corridors with widths
from three-fourths of a mile up to one and one half miles on each side of a fixed
route, based on local circumstances.

circumstances.
“(3) Jurisdictional boundaries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph, an entity is not required to provide paratransit service in an area outside
the boundaries of the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates, if the entity does not have
legal authority to operate in that area. The entity shall take all practicable steps to
provide paratransit service to any part of its service area.”
“Requirements for complementary paratransit do not apply to commuter bus …
fixed route bus service, characterized by service predominantly in one direction
during peak periods, limited stops, use of multi-ride tickets, and routes of extended
length, usually between the central business district and outlying suburbs.”
[§37.121]

6. Transit Access
RTD has guidelines for access to its facilities for pedestrians, bus riders, bicyclists,
passenger loading, and parking. The RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and
Criteria, included here by reference, is intended to be used by RTD in conjunction with
local jurisdictions in planning transit access (including projects under construction).

7. Service Guidelines for Special Events and Special Services
7.1 Derivation of Standards
The following guidelines for provision of bus and/or train service to special events are
based on prior RTD Board actions and on the public convenience and necessity to:




Protect neighborhoods from the impact of events which are so large as to overwhelm
the surrounding supply of parking, and
Serve customers by offering adequate service for events which are predictably large
enough to overload the normally available transit service, and
Protect taxpayers by only serving those events that have a predictable level of transit
demand great enough to justify the operation of special routes.

RTD will provide Express Shuttle service to Invesco Field and Coors Field from selected
Park-n-Rides for events described in this section. The General Manager must specifically
authorize Park-n-Ride service for other events.

8. Shuttles & Circulators
8.1 Characteristics
Shuttle and circulator routes are not defined as a separate class of service, but are
typically proposed to serve specific, local, community-focused needs. Shuttle and
circulator routes are generally defined by the following characteristics: short routes,
usually less than 5 miles long; operate on local streets and arterials; connect major activity
centers; and serve short passenger trip lengths within a single community. Fares must be
set according to RTD Fare Policy.

8.2 Guidelines for Success
Several factors are critical to shuttle and circulator success. As a guideline to make
informed decisions, the following characteristics must be present and considered.


A sustained average population density of at least 10 people per acre along the length
of the route is a minimum requirement; a critical mass of potential riders is needed to
succeed.



Connects community residences with major activity centers such as colleges, high
schools, middle schools, shopping districts (but not auto-centric malls), medical
centers, and downtowns that appeal to all market segments (youth, families, seniors)
and can serve a variety of trip purposes.



Transit friendly environment: pedestrian friendly, walkable streets are a minimum;
mixed land uses; areas of clustered shopping or employment; public spaces; and
bicycle parking/paths.

service span for the intended markets, typically 6:00 – 18:00 or longer.





Does not substantially duplicate a service of comparable utility.

9. System-Wide Cost Recovery Standard
The state required system-wide minimum cost recovery ratio is 30 percent. This ratio is
calculated by the following formula:
[Farebox Revenues + Advertising Revenues + Lease Revenues + FTA Operating
Assistance + Other Non-Sales Tax Revenues ] / [Category Costs applied according to
RTD Cost Model Memo, June 15, 2010, as updated (See summary below)]

Cost Model Summary
With the exception of Private Carrier costs, all costs are allocated to routes by one of
three methods: hours, miles or vehicles. The RTD Bus Cost Model has five cost categories:
Variable/Direct, Variable/Indirect, Private Carrier, Retained Costs and Depreciation. Private
Carrier costs are allocated to routes by the number of hours the contractor operates the
route, multiplied by the average hourly rate billed for that particular contract, plus the
average hourly cost for fuel.
The annual budget and six-year Strategic Budget Plan are evaluated using this cost
recovery standard.
If the standard is not met, several courses of action may be taken. The RTD Board has
adopted a policy of evaluating the fare structure as part of the annual budget process;
fares may be changed at that time to provide additional revenue. RTD may also choose to
market its services more aggressively to attract more customers and their fares, or RTD
may look for revenue from other sources. The productivity standards in Sections 2 and 3
may be used to reduce the costs of providing service while disrupting service to as few
passengers as possible.

10. Title VI & Environmental Justice Compliance
RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal
Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter 4.4.
Title VI Protected Classes are race, color and national origin.

2. Low-Income Populations (150% of Federal Poverty Guidelines)

11. Standard for Service for Transit Dependent Persons and
To Social Service Destinations
For purposes of these service standards, transit dependent riders are defined as riders who
either live in a household which does not own a car or who have a physical or mental
disability that prevents the transit patron from driving a car. Social Service destinations
are those destinations that are provided as a public service that may not have consistently
sufficient ridership to otherwise warrant the establishment or continuation of a route or
route segment. Examples of social service destinations would include county court
facilities, hospitals, schools, or public institutions which have been situated or constructed
in isolated locations prior to the establishment of RTD or following review and comment by
RTD of the proposed development plans of such institution or agency, by the appropriate
jurisdiction.

11.1 Purpose of the Standard
This standard is intended to provide for consideration of transit dependency in service
decisions. This standard does not guarantee a minimum level of service to all transitdependent riders. However, it will ensure that transit-dependent riders and/or the need to
have access to social service destinations are identified and considered when decisions are
made to reduce service levels in an area.

11.2 Determination of Transit Dependency
Whenever RTD plans changes to an existing route where there is no alternative service
available to meet the area coverage standards in Section 5 such as a change in routing or
span of service, transit-dependent riders will be identified through on-board surveys. This
survey will ask questions about riders' travel habits and demographics, and it will attempt
to identify transit-dependent riders and their destinations.

11.3 Application of Transit Dependency Standard

Attachment: Atch B - Service Standards Final (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)



Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.b

Applicable ridership standards for fixed route services may be found in Section 2.3, and
for non-fixed route services, in Section 2.4.
If the on-board survey reveals that the route does not serve the destinations desired by
transit-dependent riders, RTD may restructure the route to improve service and increase
ridership. This could include changing the routing or schedule to serve passenger needs.
RTD wishes to provide transit dependent riders with service that fits their needs and to
provide service to social service destinations when there is even a modicum of recognized
demand.
Another consideration to be given in whether or not to eliminate a route with some transit
dependent passengers is the impact on required Access-A-Ride services. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that eligible persons with disabilities be provided with
paratransit service if they have trip origins and destinations within a defined service area
three-fourths of a mile from a non-commuter fixed route. If accessible fixed route service
is considered for removal from a portion of the defined paratransit service area, an
estimate of the demand for substitute Access-A-Ride service for persons with disabilities
who require lift-equipped buses must be completed and a cost-benefit analysis performed
for the alternatives (leaving fixed route versus providing Access-A-Ride service).

12. Service Change Process
The following is a description of the steps necessary in developing and implementing
service changes, which are typically conducted each year in January, May and
September—also called runboards—as required by Board policy and the Collective
Bargaining Agreement.
Proposals are derived from a variety of inputs continuously throughout the year including:
periodic customer, household and employer surveys; stakeholder meetings; service
performance evaluation; and changing demographics and land uses. They are compiled for
each runboard and evaluated based on a number of factors, including RTD annual budget,
RTD Service Standards, effects on the transit network and on transit dependent markets
(Title VI), cost-effective services throughout the District and responsiveness to changes in
the communities within RTD. A Board paper is compiled and presented to the Board,
stakeholders and public for consideration.
Staff then discusses the proposals with members of the Board, stakeholders and senior
staff and coordinates with other staff including Marketing, Operations, Facilities and
Finance. Modifications are made as warranted and then the proposals enter the pubic
engagement process: formally scheduled public hearings; informal presentations upon
request; repository for customer input—service.changes@rtd-denver; responses to General

The applicable minimum productivity standards for a route will be reduced by one-half the
percentage of ridership that is defined as transit dependent. Thus, if 60 percent of the
riders on a route are transit dependent, the route must achieve 70 percent [100 percent
minus (60 percent divided by 2)] of the applicable productivity standards (ridership and
economic) in order not to be considered a poor performer.

Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.b

The approved changes then go into a comprehensive production process which includes:
schedule creation; bus and operator requirements and assignments; compliance with
privatization policy; runcutting and compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement;
marketing promotions and public relations; bus stop and on-street changes; printed and
electronic public information, including maps and timetables; and validation and
distribution of all data within the Transit Information Exchange System (TIES).

13. Cost Sharing Policy
13.1 Background
On June 21, 1994, the RTD Board of Directors passed a resolution, Transit Service CostSharing Policy, to provide guidance to RTD staff in responding to the increasing number of
requests for new service. This policy authorized the General Manager to pursue cost
sharing as a method of providing transit service using RTD revenues and other funds
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments; this has
resulted in a number of RTD partnerships in demonstrating new services. The following
incorporates this experience and provides guidance on the application and limitations of
cost-sharing arrangements.

13.2 Guidance
13.2.1 Financial Feasibility
Financial feasibility depends not only on the availability of funds, but also on consideration
of fares, cost/revenue allocation and equity.




Net operating cost (subsidy) needs to be defined so that all partners are treated
equitably. Net cost is the total operating cost less farebox revenue and other operating
revenues and any grant revenues secured on behalf of the proposed service. The
application of grant revenues prior to the net cost sharing allows all partners to
participate in the benefits of grant funding.
Cost-sharing projects need to adopt the RTD fare structure for similar services for
reasons of equity. Furthermore, this places all projects on the same revenue basis for
calculating net operating cost. Project sponsors may propose a fare that does not
follow the RTD fare structure. For these projects the partner is required to fund the full
difference in revenue between the comparable RTD fare and the project fare, based on
actual ridership. The adoption of any non-conforming (economically or technically) fare
is always subject to Board approval.

Manager and Board Member requests. Upon completion of public engagement, all
previous input is compiled and evaluated and revisions to the proposals are made as
warranted. A final Board report is prepared with a summary and details of proposed
changes and a summary of public hearings and other public input for approval of the
Board.

Service Development Policies & Standards



Costs associated with vehicles are addressed project by project. Vehicles can be
purchased outright by project sponsors with grant funds or provided from the RTD
inventory. Should new vehicles be required, grants should fund their acquisition and
the local share split equally by the cost-sharing partners. If no grant funds are used,
RTD will limit its share to 10%, half of the usual local share when grant funds are
used. If the RTD operates the service and agrees to provide the vehicles from its
inventory, capital costs need not be included as part of the project cost unless special
accommodations are required.
Cost-sharing projects are new or expanded transit services and RTD’s share must be
budgeted out of allocations for new services for the entire District. Thus any partner
with expectations for RTD financial or operational participation must first obtain
commitment from RTD before applying for project grants. In addition, each project will
be subject to the appropriate RTD and DRCOG planning processes, especially as
regards estimates of costs, ridership, revenue and other benefits.

13.2.2 Vehicle Availability
RTD may have, with some minor modifications, vehicles readily available to provide the
proposed service. In some cases projects require a specialty or significantly modified
vehicle that must be acquired, subject to RTD approval for fleet maintenance compatibility.
Financing these vehicles is addressed above. Sometimes the availability of operators has
been more critical.
13.2.3 Local and Community Support
Local and community entities (e.g., government, employers, businesses and associations)
generally initiate cost-sharing transit projects concomitant with other plans and
developments in the community. Thus the proposed transit project is designed to address
a specific development or perceived need. To advance their project for implementation, an
entity such as a city, will offer to share in the net costs of providing the service. RTD
needs to be responsive to these requests, but keep them in the context of the needs of
the entire District.





Projects generally have substantial institutional support; however they are subject to
the same public scrutiny, for example public hearings, as any other proposed service
change. Implementation of any cost-sharing project will continue to be subject to
RTD’s public review process.
RTD generally provides 50% of the local share of the net operating and/or capital cost
of a project. This cost-sharing ratio may be adjusted in consideration of the District
budget and policies.
Cost-sharing arrangements for each project are of limited duration for which agreed
upon performance milestones must be reached (see below). The purpose of the test
period is to assess the sustainability of the service and decide RTD’s and its partners
continuing participation. The test period is typically set at one, two or three years, as
appropriate to the project. Performance milestones must be set and evaluated and a
recommendation regarding continuation made for each year of the project.

At a minimum these criteria will include average daily ridership and RTD Service
Standards within the appropriate class of service for passenger boardings per hour and
subsidy per boarding. Additional criteria may also address issues related to project
objectives, such as new riders. State mandated cost recovery may also be considered.
Expectations of performance will be laid out in the form of milestones, such as a range
or minimum attainment at the end of each year.
During the first year performance will be assessed to determine if expectations have
been met and if continuation of the service is warranted. Often an experimental
service will need to be changed to improve performance. As warranted the same
assessment will be made in each succeeding year during the test period. This
assessment and recommendation regarding continuation will be reported to the RTD
Board each year of the test period.
If the cost-share service meets expectations and RTD Service Standards during the test
period, RTD will consider extending the period of its participation and increasing its
share of net cost; however, RTD is under no obligation to continuing any service
beyond the cost-share agreement, even if it meets Service Standards. If the cost-share
service does not perform up to expectations, RTD funding participation in such project
will be reduced or discontinued. These decisions are subject to the customary financial
and Board review.
Should RTD decide to discontinue or reduce its funding of the project service, a
sponsoring partner may choose to continue its funding by entering into a cost-sharing
agreement with RTD. This agreement will specify the service to be provided and its
cost, will be annually reviewed for potential renewal and will be subject to all RTD
Service Standards, budgeting and public processes.

1. Introduction
1.1 Overview
RTD continually receives requests for changes to existing service and for new service in
growing areas of the District. Additionally, RTD may be operating some services that are
not attracting enough riders to justify their cost. In order to be consistent in the
evaluation of service proposals, and to ensure that the service being provided represents
the most cost-effective use of the District's resources, a set of service standards is
maintained by RTD.
The specific standards, targets or minimum/maximum values for the standards, and a
procedure for applying these standards, are presented in this document. Since service
standards are intended to optimize usage of the District's resources, they are updated
periodically to reflect changes in the District goals and resources. The procedure for
updating the standards is described in Section 1.3.

1.2 Application of Service Standards
There are two primary applications for the ongoing use of the service standards. These
are the use of standards to evaluate existing services, and use of standards to evaluate
proposals for new service.
The application of standards to existing routes is a flexible process. The purpose of the
standards is to help identify routes which are most in need of service changes, such as
restructuring to eliminate lower productivity segments or branches, adjusting service
frequency to better reflect the demand for service, or providing additional promotion of
less patronized routes where appropriate. Routes, which do not meet standards, are not
automatically designated for elimination. Elimination of routes is only intended as a last
resort, when it has been determined that no cost-effective actions are available to improve
the productivity of the route.
The standards for evaluation of existing routes are not intended to preclude changes to
routes that meet these minimum standards. In many cases, it may be possible to improve
the productivity of routes that meet the minimum standards by making changes to
headways or trip times. Since the overall mission of RTD is “To meet our constituents’
present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous,
accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District,” these standards should not
be used to prevent changes to improve the efficiency of existing routes, as long as the
changes meet the route design standards.
The availability of financial resources, represented by the annual budget, is the bottom line
for these standards. Service expansion may occur when additional funds are available and
contraction may occur otherwise. In any case, selection of which services to provide or
curtail is based on these performance standards and no service is considered guaranteed

2.11.A.c

Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.c

The evaluation of new service proposals will take place as proposals are received or needs
identified. The most recent values of the standards for existing routes will be used to
evaluate the proposed new services. Decisions regarding implementation of new routes
will be made through the service planning process. New routes and services will be
expected to meet all applicable design standards described in Sections 2, 3 and 554, but
will not be expected to meet the productivity standards described in Section 2.3.2.1 until
they have been in operation for at least six months. Demonstration, experimental, and
cost sharing services are also handled in this manner.

1.3 Updating of Service Standards
The service standards are intended to support the goals and objectives of the District.
Since these objectives and the resources available to attain them can be expected to
change over time, the standards will be revised periodically to reflect those changes.
The service standards will be reviewed on a bi-annual basis. At that time, experience
with the service standards over the previous time period, as well as changes in the
District's goals and objectives, will be used to determine whether any standards should be
added or revised.
The numerical values of productivity standards will be updated each year, using ridership,
revenue and cost figures for the most recent twelve-month period for which data are
available. The rankings are based only on those routes that existed for the entire year.
Routes which were eliminated during the year will not be included because they cannot be
identified as candidates for revisions. Routes that were introduced during the year will not
be included in determining the new standards since they are not required to meet the
productivity standards until they have been in operation for at least six months. However,
these routes will be evaluated separately, using the service standards contained in this
document.
The updating procedure will compare the values of the productivity standards with those
in effect for the previous year. Operating cost data for the previous year will be revised to
account for system-wide increases or decreases in operating cost.

2. Performance Standards
2.1

Derivation and Use of Standards

The productivity standards are used to identify routes and services for appropriate
marketing and possible revision or elimination. Separate standards are identified for each
class of service. Routes are evaluated on ridership (either boardings per in-service hour or
per trip, depending on the class of service) and on the economic measure of subsidy per
passenger. These standards are based on the performance of the least productive 10
percent of the routes in each service class for either the ridership or economic measure, or

Service Development Policies & Standards

on the least productive 25 percent of routes in both measures. The basis for the
standards will be reviewed in conjunction with the cost recovery standards in Section 996,
and may be revised if necessary.
New services should meet the applicable standards for their class of service after six
months of operation. All new services will be reviewed after six months of operation and
routes that have not shown adequate progress toward meeting the standards will be
targeted for cost-effective actions to increase productivity or for elimination.
For the purpose of applying the standards, Local and Limited routes will be divided into
three groups based on area-type land-use designations: CBD routes (routes which serve
the Denver Central Business District), Urban routes, and Suburban routes. These
groupings of Local and Limited routes will enable the comparison of routes with similar
service characteristics. Express, Regional and sky Ride routes will be evaluated as
separate classes due to their different service characteristics. For the purposes of
evaluating productivity, Light Rail will be measured against the standards established for
CBD Local routes, except where otherwise noted.
To meet the RTD mission to provide cost-effective service throughout the District, RTD
has developed different types or classes of service that serve specific markets and,
therefore, have different performance expectations. Due to their different service
characteristics Express, Regional and SkyRide were treated as separate classes. However,
due to the deployment of rail, BRT and resulting service restructuring, these classes are
reconfigured. The routes in these three are reassigned into a new, consolidated Regional
class or the Local CBD class. Regional class includes routes providing high-speed service
on limited access highways from suburban and outlying communities to downtown
Denver, Denver International Airport and other metro, major employment centers, and
provided at distances of approximately 6 miles or more. Local services have three subclassifications: CBD—any route serving downtown Denver; Urban—35% or more of route
length within a ¼ mile buffer has population+employment density of 12 per acre or
greater; and Suburban—34% or less. Call-n-Ride and Access-a-Ride are separate classes.
Enhanced bus and BRT routes may warrant future consideration regarding their operation
with: dedicated right-of-way; partially dedicated ROW; limited or express mode; priority
over other traffic; and various speeds appropriate to context. [Please see attachment A
Service Classes for details on how these revisions affect current routes.]
The standards for evaluating portions of routes are intended for use in identifying needed
service improvements, for making modifications to specific portions of existing routes, or
for identifying low productivity segments of routes.
These standards could be used in situations such as isolating low productivity portions of
otherwise productive routes or measuring options for bringing unproductive routes into
compliance with the overall service standards. These standards may also be used to
evaluate proposals for new route extensions or deviations on existing routes.

2.2 Ridership and Economic Measures

2.11.A.c

Service Development Policies & Standards

The RTD’s approach is to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel
markets. All services are designed to match the level of service with demand, thus
improving performance and sustainability. This results in multiple domains of acceptable
performance for the various classes of service. Standards are best set by first determining
measures of performance and objectives. The core objective is to maximize overall
ridership, to the extent allowed by the available resources.
2.2.1 Performance Objective
Service allocation is driven by the RTD adopted mission statement: “To meet our
constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible cost-effective service throughout the District.”
Performance Measures
 Passengers/hour (productivity)
 Passengers/trip (Regional class
productivity)
 Subsidy/passenger (cost
effectiveness)
The subsidy per passenger measure
combines fare revenue and total cost
impacts to produce a measure that
comprehensively reflects the District’s
allocation of resources. The effectivenessproductivity chart, Error! Reference source
not found.Figure 1 - Effectiveness - Figure 1 Effectiveness - Productivity Chart
Productivity Chart, presents economic
effectiveness on the vertical axis, and productivity, or boardings per hour, on the
horizontal axis. The chart offers a convenient comparative analysis of all classes of
services, illustrating both absolute and relative performance.
When standards and
guidelines are applied, judgments can be made.

2.3 Fixed Route Service Design and Evaluation Standards
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
New routes shall provide the minimum frequencies specified below. Existing services that
cannot meet these minimum standards while adhering to the minimum passengers per
hour or trip standards defined in Section 2.3.2 shall be identified as candidates for service
changes or appropriate marketing promotion within available resources. These service
changes may include providing service with longer headways if no other viable alternative
exists. Elimination of the route may be considered if service changes and/or promotional
efforts do not improve productivity.
These are “policy” service levels and represent a compromise between economic
efficiency and the functionality of the system. To be sustained at these levels, a route
must meet the minimum ridership performance standards discussed in Section 2.3.2.1 and

2.3.2 Minimum Ridership Performance
This standard applies to routes operating at the minimum service frequency target. For
Local and Limited routes, the standard is passengers per hour based upon the bottom 10%
and 25% of routes in the respective class. For Express, Regional, and SkyRide routes, the
standard is passengers per trip.
These standards are derived from system averages by class of service. All routes must
meet their applicable minimum standards. Those that do not meet these standards will
need to be modified or marketed in some way in order to bring them up to the minimum
standards. Those that are not brought up to the minimum standards are subject to
cancellation. Routes that meet their applicable minimum ridership standards justify a
service level at the minimum service frequencies outlined in Section 2.3.1. Higher
frequencies must be justified by ridership as outlined in Section 2.3.4.
2.3.2.1

On rail, the first trip of the operating day in each direction, operated as the “Sweep
Train” and pull-outs, is exempted from the minimum ridership standards.
Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard

For Local and Limited routes in the peak, the maximum load standard is 125% of a seated
load at the maximum load point. For Local and Limited routes outside of the peak, and for
Express, Regional, and SkyRide routes at all times, the maximum load is the seated
capacity of the vehicle.
Service frequencies shall be adjusted so that the following maximum load standards are
met at least 60 percent of the time:


Local and Limited Service:
Peak periods – 125 percent of seated load on RTD's present bus fleet. The
maximum time that an individual passenger should be expected to stand on a given
trip is 15 minutes.
Off-peak periods - seated load



Express, Regional, and SkyRide Service:
Seated load at all times.



Light Rail vehicles:

Attachment: Redlined Service Standards - Proposed Revisions 2016 (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)

2.3.2.2 Specific Trips Ridership Standards

Service Development Policies & Standards

Peak periods – 125 passengers per vehicle
Off-peak periods – seated load
Special events – 165 passengers per vehicle
From the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual: “From the passenger
perspective, the passenger load on a transit vehicle affects the comfort of the on-board
vehicle portion of a transit trip-both in terms of being able to find a seat and in overall
crowding levels within the vehicle. From a transit operator's perspective, a poor quality of
service may indicate the need to increase service frequency or vehicle size to reduce
crowding and increase passenger comfort.”
RTD defines crowding as a seated load plus the standing passenger space, as calculated
for each vehicle by subtracting the area occupied by seats and other objects from the
gross interior floor area. The amount of crowding on a route is defined as the percent of
total trips during a defined time period that exceed a comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3
square feet per standee, generally having these characteristics (See page 5-24 of the
Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, 3rd Edition,
http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_165ch-05.pdf):
 Standing load without body contact
 Standees have similar amount of personal space as seated passengers
 Reasonably easy circulation within vehicle
The maximum number of standees can be computed for each vehicle by determining its
standing passenger square footage and dividing by 4.3—5.3. For any service class during
any defined period (e.g., AM early, AM peak, midday), when 10% or more of the
directional trips exceed the computed maximum standees at the maximum load point,
further investigation of potential remedies, such as changing the bus assignment or
frequency of service, is warranted. For special events heavier loads are expected and
acceptable, but when 10% or more of trips during the take-away have 4 or less square
feet per standing passenger, further investigation of potential remedies is warranted. See
Attachment D Crowding Report Examples for reference. The Percent of Total Trips chart
(lower right) with level-of-service D or E would indicate crowding.
2.3.4 Demand Based Service Frequency
Service frequency in the RTD network is based on clock-pattern schedules. This pattern
provides consistent and easy to understand schedules for our customers, and makes
possible the provision of timed transfer connection hubs, whereby multiple routes are
scheduled to meet at one location to facilitate connections. In general, routes are
scheduled to operate in even increments of 30 minutes, or every 60, 30, 15, 10, 7.5, or 5
minutes. However, other frequencies may be provided depending upon passenger
demand, or operational and scheduling needs.
For routes meeting the above frequency, ridership, and load standards, frequency better
than every 30 minutes may be provided when and where justified by ridership. This
standard applies equally to all service categories. In order to be sustainable, higher
frequency service must meet the following criteria:

Incremental frequency necessary to maintain the appropriate load standard during any
30 minute time period.
Appropriate vehicle assignment as outlined in Section 2.3.5
When a service exceeds the maximum load standard, higher frequency may be justified
during that time period and/or route segment.
If a service with better than the minimum frequency has passenger loads that can be
accommodated with a lower frequency without violating the load standard, then
frequency may be reduced.
As a general guideline, a typical productivity by service frequency, for a whole route or
a segment or time period is provided in Table 3 Demand Based Service Frequency

Small 27’-30’ Bus: Appropriate for lower volume Local routes where ridership does
not require a standard bus, or for routes where specific operating concerns preclude
use of standard buses and for Call-n-Ride.
Standard 40’ Transit Bus: The standard equipment for Local and Express Regional
services. May also be used on Regional and SkyRide trips in the Express fare category.
Articulated 60’ Bus: Appropriate for higher volume Limited and Express Regional
services. May also be used on Regional and SkyRide trips in the Express fare category.
Intercity Coach: Appropriate for Regional and SkyRide services.

2.3.6 Design and Evaluation of Portions of Routes
The standards for evaluating portions of routes cover two areas in which minor
modifications may be made to routes without changing the overall structure of the route:
 midline segments or midline deviations
 branches or end segments
The governing standards for overall route productivity were presented earlier. Since trips
provided during marginally productive hours of the day or trips over marginal segments
often increase the attractiveness of the overall service, an otherwise productive route may
be able to support some less productive trips or portions of the route. However, if a route
cannot meet the overall service standards for its class of service, there may not be
productive segments to enhance the unproductive segments. Therefore, specific
segments, branches, or trips which meet the standards for portions of routes may still be

2.11.A.c

2.3.6.1 Midline Segments and Midline Deviations




A midline segment or deviation of a Local or Limited route should generate enough
boardings per hour of service provided to meet the standard for its class of service
(CBD, Urban and Suburban). Boardings in both directions will be counted.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause a reduction in the overall boardings
per hour for the route.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause the route to violate any route design
standards as defined in Section 2.3, or the overall productivity standards as defined in
Section 2.

2.3.6.2 Branches and End Segments









A branch or end segment of a Local or Limited route should generate enough boardings
to meet the ridership standard for its class of service (CBD, Urban and Suburban).
Boardings generated along the branch are defined as all passengers boarding the bus
along the branch or end portion of the route, and all outbound passengers alighting
along this section.
Local collector portions of Express and Regional routes which meet the following
maximum travel time standard, shall meet the ridership productivity standard for the
entire route. This maximum travel time is equal to 15 minutes or 50 percent of line
haul travel time, whichever is less.
For shorter segments, the minimum ridership standard is reduced by the ratio of actual
travel time to the maximum allowable travel time. Thus, if the actual travel time along
the collector is half of the maximum allowed, it must average half the number of
boardings per trip specified in the minimum ridership productivity standard.
A new extension to a route that does not meet the minimum ridership productivity
standard must attract sufficient ridership for the entire route to meet the minimum
ridership standard for its service class.
A route extension will not be initiated if it violates any of the route design standards
found in Section 2.3, or causes the route as a whole to fall below the minimum riders
per unit of service or standards found earlier in Section 2.3.2.

2.4 Demand Response Service Design and Evaluation Standards
RTD continues to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel markets.
The goal of this approach is to match the type and level of service to the demand in a
given service area, thus improving performance and sustainability. As such, a variety of
non-fixed route services are provided by the RTD including the following.
2.4.1 Call-n-Ride
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive Call-n-Ride
service is characterized as a shared ride within a defined geographic service area and the
need for the passenger to arrange for pick-up in advance or be at a designated checkpoint

modified in order to raise the productivity of the entire route, if the overall route does not
meet the service standards for its class of service.

Service Development Policies & Standards

at prescheduled times. A Call-n-Ride service area averages about 7 square miles or
between about 2 to 30 square miles depending on its number of vehicles and service
configuration—predominantly station feeder or community-based service. Call-n-Ride often
provides first/last mile access to the broader RTD network of services through timed
connections at transfer centers and Park-n-Rides. Population plus employment is
predominantly 3 to 12 persons per acre. Call-n-Ride service is evaluated based on
passenger boardings per revenue hour and subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
Access-a-Ride provides ADA complementary paratransit in the District to individuals who
cannot readily access the bus and rail system. As per US DOT requirements the
passenger’s trip origin and destination must be within ¾ mile of RTD’s non-commuter bus
route system, during the same days and hours of their operation and within the District
boundaries, and curb-to-curb service must be provided. However, RTD provides door-todoor service as a reasonable accommodation. Trips must be booked at least one day and
up to 3 days in advance; however, RTD also offers subscriptions.
All applicants must qualify for certification under the guidelines established by the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, complete a functional evaluation in person,
provide a physician’s statements to verify disability and must meet one of the following
criteria:
 Be unable to get to and from a bus stop or on and off a lift-equipped bus by yourself
 Have a cognitive disability that prohibits your understanding of how to complete bus
trips
2.4.3 Vanpooling
Vanpooling is a public transportation option in which commuters, whose residences are
geographically clustered, ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically vanpools make one roundtrip per day and
carry from 5 to 14 riders. Vanpooling offers greater opportunities for increased capacity
compared to carpooling and offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit in
areas of low employment density and longer commute distances. RTD contracts for this
service with DRCOG to subsidize the portion of the commute trip within the District.
Vanpool service is evaluated based on subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.4 SeniorRide and Senior Shopper
SeniorRide Special Events transports groups to a variety of cultural, educational and
entertainment events. The Schedule of events is published 3 times a year to the public.
Service is available on a first come first served basis. A minimum of 10 passengers per
trip is required. Scheduled events that do not generate reservations of at least 2 groups of
10 may not be rescheduled for the next 12 months.

Service Development Policies & Standards

SeniorShopper buses have established routes that provide trips to major grocery stores.
Service is available Monday through Friday. A minimum of 10 passengers per trip is
required.
RTD provides services to enhance the welfare of certain groups of persons such as the
current services offered for shopping and recreational trips for elderly persons or persons
with disabilities. Since SeniorRide and Senior Shopper service are point to point services,
these services are evaluated based on passenger boardings per trip. Refer to Appendix A
for current standards.

2.5 Reliability
On-time for fixed-route service is defined as not more than 1 minute early to not more than
5 minutes late. RTD sets annual objectives for on-time performance by class of service
and which are reported in the Quarterly Performance Report. [Improved methods for
monitoring, identifying the causes and remedying unreliable service are currently in
development.]

3. Geometric Design Standards
3.1 Directness of Route
Routes shall be designed to be as direct as possible and to provide maximum accessibility
to transit.
 Deviations from a direct path from end-to-end of the route shall account for no more
than one-quarter of the end-to-end travel time of the route.


For a specific deviation, the total additional travel time for all through passengers
should not exceed three minutes for each rider boarding or alighting along the
deviation.
In mathematical terms, this means that the quantity
Pt * VTT < 3 minutes
Pd
where: Pt = through passengers
VTT = additional vehicle one-way travel time
Pd = passengers served by deviation

3.2 Stop Spacing Standards
Bus routes shall adhere to the following stop spacing standards. Placement also
considers: the balance between pedestrian access and route travel time; ADA
requirements; adjacent land uses; streetscape conditions and property ownership.
3.2.1 Minimum

3.3 Roadway Design Goal
New bus routes should not be operated along streets that do not meet minimum
standards:, such as for bus turning radius, pavement strength/loading, lane width,
roadway grade, shoulder width on rural roads (for pedestrian waiting and safety) and
overhead clearance. Refer to the RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria Section 1 –
Transit Access for specific details [currently in development].
 Turning radius - 35' minimum
 Street surface must be asphalt or concrete
 For deep-strength asphalt: 7" for existing street; 11" for new street
 For concrete pavement : 8.5" design thickness; 8" existing thickness
 Lane width - 10' minimum
 No speed bumps
 Bridges - rated for H-20S loading (all legal weights)
 Shoulder width on rural roads - 6' minimum
 Overhead clearance - 12' minimum (16' 6" for structures on new roads)

4. Shelters
The minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter is 40 boardings per day at the stop.
Stops with the highest average of daily boardings will take top priority for shelter
placement. [Revised standards are currently in development and will reference the RTD
Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria.]

5. Area Coverage Standards
5.1 Purpose and Application
The purpose of these standards is to define a reasonable level of service to all areas of the
District and to help RTD maintain this service level. Since the RTD service area includes
many different types of development, and population densities and land use vary widely
across the District, it would not be reasonable to expect all areas to support the same level
of service. Moreover, different types of service may best meet the needs of different
areas, and RTD's resources can be used in a more productive fashion if service can be
tailored to the needs of particular areas. Area coverage standards provide guidelines for
tailoring service to the needs of communities and help ensure that all areas receive a level
of service that is commensurate with their needs.

Service Development Policies & Standards

Levels of service for specific areas also depend on the productivity of existing services. If
existing or proposed services cannot meet the productivity standards outlined in Section 2,
RTD may choose not to provide the minimum level of service. Financial constraints may
also limit RTD's ability to meet the area coverage (or any other) standards.

5.2 Coverage Levels Outside the Denver CBD
The area coverage standards for areas outside the Denver Central Business District (CBD)
are based on a combined density measure. This measure adds population and employment
to determine potential demand for transportation to and from a particular area.
[Attachment B shows the density classifications overlaid with RTD services for the entire
District.]
The area coverage standards presented below deal with minimum and maximum route
spacing. Actual route spacing and service frequency will depend on demand and
productivity of existing service in the area.
For use in this document, arterial roadways are defined as follows:
 Traffic flow controlled by traffic signals as opposed to stop signs
 Carry longer distance traffic flow
 Speed limit 30 mph or faster
 Road width two plus lanes in each direction
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre
 Peak period Park-n-Ride service if either the travel time to the Denver CBD by Express
bus or rail, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.
 Call-n-Ride service.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
 Local service on major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
 Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from Park-n-Rides if either the travel
time to the Denver CBD by Express bus, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20
minutes.
5.2.2 Maximum Target Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre:
 Local service along major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
 Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from park-n- Rides if travel time to
the Denver CBD by Express bus exceeds 20 minutes.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
 Local service with ½ mile route spacing.
 Limited, Express, or Regional service if travel time to the Denver CBD by Express bus
exceeds 20 minutes.

radius at the ends of each fixed route.
(ii) Within the core service area, the entity also shall provide service to small areas
not inside any of the corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.
(iii) Outside the core service area, the entity may designate corridors with widths
from three-fourths of a mile up to one and one half miles on each side of a fixed
route, based on local circumstances.
(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the core service area is that area in which
corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on each side of each fixed route
merge together such that, with few and small exceptions, all origins and
destinations within the area would be served.
“(2) Rail.
(i) For rail systems, the service area shall consist of a circle with a radius of 3/4 of
a mile around each station.
(ii) At end stations and other stations in outlying areas, the entity may designate
circles with radii of up to 11/2 miles as part of its service area, based on local
circumstances.
“(3) Jurisdictional boundaries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph, an entity is not required to provide paratransit service in an area outside
the boundaries of the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates, if the entity does not have
legal authority to operate in that area. The entity shall take all practicable steps to
provide paratransit service to any part of its service area.”
“Requirements for complementary paratransit do not apply to commuter bus …
fixed route bus service, characterized by service predominantly in one direction
during peak periods, limited stops, use of multi-ride tickets, and routes of extended
length, usually between the central business district and outlying suburbs.”
[§37.121]

6. Transit Access
RTD has guidelines for access to its facilities for pedestrians, bus riders, bicyclists,
passenger loading, and parking. The RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria, included here
by reference, is intended to be used by RTD in conjunction with local jurisdictions in
planning transit access (including projects under construction) [separately under
development].

Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.c

The following guidelines for provision of bus and/or train service to special events are
based on prior RTD Board actions and on the public convenience and necessity to:




Protect neighborhoods from the impact of events which are so large as to overwhelm
the surrounding supply of parking, and
Serve customers by offering adequate service for events which are predictably large
enough to overload the normally available transit service, and
Protect taxpayers by only serving those events that have a predictable level of transit
demand great enough to justify the operation of special routes.

7.2

Standards for Events

RTD, within the limits of its budget, will operate special service:




For events at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium with projected attendance of over
55,000, for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
For events at Coors Field with projected attendance of over 40,000, for which the
crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
At other venues where the ratio of projected attendance to available on-site parking is
6:1 and for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.

This service will not be provided when substantial numbers of the event patrons can be
expected to arrive in privately operated or non-profit owned buses or regularly scheduled
RTD service.
RTD will provide Express Shuttle service to Invesco Field and Coors Field from selected
Park-n-Rides for events described in this section. The General Manager must specifically
authorize Park-n-Ride service for other events.
RTD may also provide service at events with lower attendance projections if the promoter
is willing to subsidize such service. The RTD Board adopted a specific subsidy formula in
September 1987: “the prorated share of RTD’s incremental cost of service, plus a 10%
administrative service fee, the share to be based on the percentage shortfall in ridership
between the minimum ridership of 1650 passengers going to the event and the actual
number of passengers carried, based on RTD traffic checks.”

8. Shuttles & Circulators
8.1 Characteristics
Shuttle and circulator routes are not defined as a separate class of service, but are
typically proposed to serve specific, local, community-focused needs. Shuttle and
circulator routes are generally defined by the following characteristics: short routes,
usually less than 5 miles long; operate on local streets and arterials; connect major activity

7.1 Derivation of Standards

Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.c

8.2 Guidelines for Success
Several factors are critical to shuttle and circulator success. As a guideline to make
informed decisions, the following characteristics must be present and considered.


A sustained average population density of at least 10 people per acre along the length
of the route is a minimum requirement; a critical mass of potential riders is needed to
succeed.



Connects community residences with major activity centers such as colleges, high
schools, middle schools, shopping districts (but not auto-centric malls), medical
centers, and downtowns that appeal to all market segments (youth, families, seniors)
and can serve a variety of trip purposes.



Transit friendly environment: pedestrian friendly, walkable streets are a minimum;
mixed land uses; areas of clustered shopping or employment; public spaces; and
bicycle parking/paths.



To attract spontaneous walk up use, the headway needs to be15 minutes or less for a
service span for the intended markets, typically 6:00 – 18:00 or longer.



Offers bi-directional service.



Does not substantially duplicate a service of comparable utility.

9. System-Wide Cost Recovery Standard
The state required system-wide minimum cost recovery ratio is 30 percent. This ratio is
calculated by the following formula:

[Farebox Revenues + Advertising Revenues + Lease Revenues + FTA Operating
Assistance + Other Non-Sales Tax Revenues ] / [Category I Costs +Category II Costs +
Local share of depreciation on RTD assets] [Category Costs applied according to RTD Cost
Model Memo, June 15, 2010, as updated (See summary below)]
Cost Model Summary
With the exception of Private Carrier costs, all costs are allocated to routes by one of
three methods: hours, miles or vehicles. The RTD Bus Cost Model has five cost categories:
Variable/Direct, Variable/Indirect, Private Carrier, Retained Costs and Depreciation. Private
Carrier costs are allocated to routes by the number of hours the contractor operates the
route, multiplied by the average hourly rate billed for that particular contract, plus the
average hourly cost for fuel.

centers; and serve short passenger trip lengths within a single community. Fares must be
set according to RTD Fare Policy.

Service Development Policies & Standards

The annual budget and six-year Strategic Budget Plan are evaluated using this cost
recovery standard.
If the standard is not met, several courses of action may be taken. The RTD Board has
adopted a policy of evaluating the fare structure as part of the annual budget process;
fares may be changed at that time to provide additional revenue. RTD may also choose to
market its services more aggressively to attract more customers and their fares, or RTD
may look for revenue from other sources. The productivity standards in Sections 2 and 3
may be used to reduce the costs of providing service while disrupting service to as few
passengers as possible.

10. Title VI & Environmental Justice Compliance
RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal
Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter 4.4.
Title VI Protected Classes are race, color and national origin.
Environmental Justice Protected Classes are as follows:
1. Minority Populations:
 American Indian and Alaska Native, which refers to people having origins in any of
the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and
who maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment.
 Asian, which refers to people having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far
East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia,
China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and
Vietnam.
 Black or African American, which refers to people having origins in any of the Black
racial groups of Africa.
 Hispanic or Latino, which includes persons of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South
or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.
 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, which refers to people having origins in
any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.
2. Low-Income Populations (150% of Federal Poverty Guidelines)

10.11. Standard for Service for Transit Dependent Persons and
To Social Service Destinations
For purposes of these service standards, transit dependent riders are defined as riders who
either live in a household which does not own a car or who have a physical or mental
disability that prevents the transit patron from driving a car. Social Service destinations
are those destinations that are provided as a public service that may not have consistently
sufficient ridership to otherwise warrant the establishment or continuation of a route or
route segment. Examples of social service destinations would include county court
facilities, hospitals, schools, or public institutions which have been situated or constructed

Service Development Policies & Standards

in isolated locations prior to the establishment of RTD or following review and comment by
RTD of the proposed development plans of such institution or agency, by the appropriate
jurisdiction.

10.111.1

Purpose of the Standard

This standard is intended to provide for consideration of transit dependency in service
decisions. This standard does not guarantee a minimum level of service to all transitdependent riders. However, it will ensure that transit-dependent riders and/or the need to
have access to social service destinations are identified and considered when decisions are
made to reduce service levels in an area.

10.211.2

Determination of Transit Dependency

Whenever RTD plans changes to an existing route where there is no alternative service
available to meet the area coverage standards in Section 5 such as a change in routing or
span of service, transit-dependent riders will be identified through on-board surveys. This
survey will ask questions about riders' travel habits and demographics, and it will attempt
to identify transit-dependent riders and their destinations.

10.311.3

Application of Transit Dependency Standard

The applicable minimum productivity standards for a route will be reduced by one-half the
percentage of ridership that is defined as transit dependent. Thus, if 60 percent of the
riders on a route are transit dependent, the route must achieve 70 percent [100 percent
minus (60 percent divided by 2)] of the applicable productivity standards (ridership and
economic) in order not to be considered a poor performer.
Applicable ridership standards for fixed route services may be found in Section 2.3, and
for non-fixed route services, in Section 2.4.
If the on-board survey reveals that the route does not serve the destinations desired by
transit-dependent riders, RTD may restructure the route to improve service and increase
ridership. This could include changing the routing or schedule to serve passenger needs.
RTD wishes to provide transit dependent riders with service that fits their needs and to
provide service to social service destinations when there is even a modicum of recognized
demand.
Another consideration to be given in whether or not to eliminate a route with some transit
dependent passengers is the impact on required Access-A-Ride services. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that eligible persons with disabilities be provided with
paratransit service if they have trip origins and destinations within a defined service area
three-fourths of a mile from a non-commuter fixed route. If accessible fixed route service
is considered for removal from a portion of the defined paratransit service area, an
estimate of the demand for substitute Access-A-Ride service for persons with disabilities
who require lift-equipped buses must be completed and a cost-benefit analysis performed
for the alternatives (leaving fixed route versus providing Access-A-Ride service).

Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.c

The following is a description of the steps necessary in developing and implementing
service changes, which are typically conducted each year in January, May and
September—also called runboards—as required by Board policy and the Collective
Bargaining Agreement.
Proposals are derived from a variety of inputs continuously throughout the year including:
periodic customer, household and employer surveys; stakeholder meetings; service
performance evaluation; and changing demographics and land uses. They are compiled for
each runboard and evaluated based on a number of factors, including RTD annual budget,
RTD Service Standards, effects on the transit network and on transit dependent markets
(Title VI), cost-effective services throughout the District and responsiveness to changes in
the communities within RTD. A Board paper is compiled and presented to the Board,
stakeholders and public for consideration.
Staff then discusses the proposals with members of the Board, stakeholders and senior
staff and coordinates with other staff including Marketing, Operations, Facilities and
Finance. Modifications are made as warranted and then the proposals enter the pubic
engagement process: formally scheduled public hearings; informal presentations upon
request; repository for customer input—service.changes@rtd-denver; responses to General
Manager and Board Member requests. Upon completion of public engagement, all
previous input is compiled and evaluated and revisions to the proposals are made as
warranted. A final Board report is prepared with a summary and details of proposed
changes and a summary of public hearings and other public input for approval of the
Board.
The approved changes then go into a comprehensive production process which includes:
schedule creation; bus and operator requirements and assignments; compliance with
privatization policy; runcutting and compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement;
marketing promotions and public relations; bus stop and on-street changes; printed and
electronic public information, including maps and timetables; and validation and
distribution of all data within the Transit Information Exchange System (TIES).

13. Cost Sharing Policy
13.1 Background
On June 21, 1994, the RTD Board of Directors passed a resolution, Transit Service CostSharing Policy, to provide guidance to RTD staff in responding to the increasing number of
requests for new service. This policy authorized the General Manager to pursue cost
sharing as a method of providing transit service using RTD revenues and other funds
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments; this has
resulted in a number of RTD partnerships in demonstrating new services. The following
incorporates this experience and provides guidance on the application and limitations of
cost-sharing arrangements.

12. Service Change Process

Service Development Policies & Standards

2.11.A.c

13.2.1 Financial Feasibility
Financial feasibility depends not only on the availability of funds, but also on consideration
of fares, cost/revenue allocation and equity.








Net operating cost (subsidy) needs to be defined so that all partners are treated
equitably. Net cost is the total operating cost less farebox revenue and other operating
revenues and any grant revenues secured on behalf of the proposed service. The
application of grant revenues prior to the net cost sharing allows all partners to
participate in the benefits of grant funding.
Cost-sharing projects need to adopt the RTD fare structure for similar services for
reasons of equity. Furthermore, this places all projects on the same revenue basis for
calculating net operating cost. Project sponsors may propose a fare that does not
follow the RTD fare structure. For these projects the partner is required to fund the full
difference in revenue between the comparable RTD fare and the project fare, based on
actual ridership. The adoption of any non-conforming (economically or technically) fare
is always subject to Board approval.
Costs associated with vehicles are addressed project by project. Vehicles can be
purchased outright by project sponsors with grant funds or provided from the RTD
inventory. Should new vehicles be required, grants should fund their acquisition and
the local share split equally by the cost-sharing partners. If no grant funds are used,
RTD will limit its share to 10%, half of the usual local share when grant funds are
used. If the RTD operates the service and agrees to provide the vehicles from its
inventory, capital costs need not be included as part of the project cost unless special
accommodations are required.
Cost-sharing projects are new or expanded transit services and RTD’s share must be
budgeted out of allocations for new services for the entire District. Thus any partner
with expectations for RTD financial or operational participation must first obtain
commitment from RTD before applying for project grants. In addition, each project will
be subject to the appropriate RTD and DRCOG planning processes, especially as
regards estimates of costs, ridership, revenue and other benefits.

13.2.2 Vehicle Availability
RTD may have, with some minor modifications, vehicles readily available to provide the
proposed service. In some cases projects require a specialty or significantly modified
vehicle that must be acquired, subject to RTD approval for fleet maintenance compatibility.
Financing these vehicles is addressed above. Sometimes the availability of operators has
been more critical.
13.2.3 Local and Community Support
Local and community entities (e.g., government, employers, businesses and associations)
generally initiate cost-sharing transit projects concomitant with other plans and
developments in the community. Thus the proposed transit project is designed to address
a specific development or perceived need. To advance their project for implementation, an

13.2 Guidance

Service Development Policies & Standards

entity such as a city, will offer to share in the net costs of providing the service. RTD
needs to be responsive to these requests, but keep them in the context of the needs of
the entire District.





Projects generally have substantial institutional support; however they are subject to
the same public scrutiny, for example public hearings, as any other proposed service
change. Implementation of any cost-sharing project will continue to be subject to
RTD’s public review process.
RTD generally provides 50% of the local share of the net operating and/or capital cost
of a project. This cost-sharing ratio may be adjusted in consideration of the District
budget and policies.
Cost-sharing arrangements for each project are of limited duration for which agreed
upon performance milestones must be reached (see below). The purpose of the test
period is to assess the sustainability of the service and decide RTD’s and its partners
continuing participation. The test period is typically set at one, two or three years, as
appropriate to the project. Performance milestones must be set and evaluated and a
recommendation regarding continuation made for each year of the project.

13.2.4 Performance
Cost-sharing services will have clearly defined evaluative criteria agreed upon within the
cost-sharing agreement and prior to implementation.








At a minimum these criteria will include average daily ridership and RTD Service
Standards within the appropriate class of service for passenger boardings per hour and
subsidy per boarding. Additional criteria may also address issues related to project
objectives, such as new riders. State mandated cost recovery may also be considered.
Expectations of performance will be laid out in the form of milestones, such as a range
or minimum attainment at the end of each year.
During the first year performance will be assessed to determine if expectations have
been met and if continuation of the service is warranted. Often an experimental
service will need to be changed to improve performance. As warranted the same
assessment will be made in each succeeding year during the test period. This
assessment and recommendation regarding continuation will be reported to the RTD
Board each year of the test period.
If the cost-share service meets expectations and RTD Service Standards during the test
period, RTD will consider extending the period of its participation and increasing its
share of net cost; however, RTD is under no obligation to continuing any service
beyond the cost-share agreement, even if it meets Service Standards. If the cost-share
service does not perform up to expectations, RTD funding participation in such project
will be reduced or discontinued. These decisions are subject to the customary financial
and Board review.
Should RTD decide to discontinue or reduce its funding of the project service, a
sponsoring partner may choose to continue its funding by entering into a cost-sharing
agreement with RTD. This agreement will specify the service to be provided and its
cost, will be annually reviewed for potential renewal and will be subject to all RTD
Service Standards, budgeting and public processes.

Amendment to Lease for Office Space at Civic
Center Plaza – 1560 Broadway, Suites 510,
605, 610, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to amend and
extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional Transportation District and CO-Denver Post
Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC and EOP-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC
for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099 on the 5 th, 6th, 7th and 10th
floors, containing approximately 84,903 square feet, in the building commonly known as Civic Center
Plaza for Planning and Capital Programs personnel, IT personnel, Paratransit Services and Contracted
Services. This amendment will consolidate all leased space into one lease, will add approximately 3,046
square feet to the 6th floor and will amend and extend all previous leases and amendments to provide for
all to expire on December 31, 2022. On the original 73,480 square feet, base rent began at $16.50 per
square foot, has increased annually by $0.50 and will conclude in the final year of the lease at $21.50
per square foot, January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. (Rent for the remaining 11,423 square
feet will be $20.00 per square foot in the final year). Funding for the space to be used by the FasTracks
program was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year
budgets. Funding for the space to be used by the base system will be appropriated in future year
budgets.
BACKGROUND
In 2005 the Planning and Development Department of RTD required office space for employees and
contractors to be housed together for the management, planning, design and construction of the
FasTracks Project. Property Management with the assistance of a broker viewed and evaluated several
downtown office buildings within a reasonable distance of RTD’s main administrative office at 1600
Blake Street and adjacent to transit. Several other factors, including cost, network cabling, ability to
expand and public meeting facilities were used in evaluating space. Currently, RTD’s Planning and
Capital Programs departments and IT personnel occupy the space on the 5th, 6th and 7th floors of the
Civic Center Plaza. In January of 2006, Paratransit Services and its related call center moved into the
building on the 10th floor. In May 2012, IT required additional space on the 10th floor and a lease was
entered into.
DISCUSSION
The proposed lease extension for the current office space and the addition of 3,046 square feet on the
6th floor will provide needed office space for the current users through 2022. The Civic Center Building
is considered to be Class A office space. Current market rents for Class A office space average $24 per
square foot, with operating expenses at approximately $9.00 per square foot for a total rent per square
foot of approximately $33. The lease extension as negotiated provides for a base rent of $16.50 per

Packet Pg. 82

2.12.B

square foot annually with a $0.50 per square foot annual increase. In addition, RTD is responsible for
its’ pro rata share of operating expenses, historically and currently approximately $7.00 per square foot
annually. At approximately $23.50 to $26 per square foot, the negotiated extension is below or at
market rate.
Using information collected from CoStar, JLL (Jones Lang Lasalle) and other sources, lease comparables
were evaluated. Recent renewal rates average just over $40.00 per square foot in gross effective rent
(including operating expenses and net of rent abatement). As part of the negotiation of the extension
and amendment, a tenant improvement allowance of $1,056,910.00 will be given to RTD who will have
the option to apply toward tenant improvements or to defray future rents. Extension of the current
leases will provide a significant presence at the newly refurbished Civic Center Station and provide
needed office space.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Annualized base rent for the entire leases premises will be approximately $1.5 million for the first year
and approximately $1.8 in the final year. Funding for future year leases of office space to be used by the
FasTracks program is included in future years in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and the funding
for space used by the base system will be appropriated annually. RTD has the ability to use the
approximate $2.2 million allowance provided by owner at any time during the term of the lease
(approximately $1.2 million from previous extension and $1 million with the current extension).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary
to amend and extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional Transportation District
and CO-Denver Post Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC and EOPOne Civic Center Plaza, LLC for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650, 700, 1000, 1075
and 1099 on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 10th floors, containing approximately 84,903 square feet, in the
building commonly known as Civic Center Plaza for Planning and Capital Programs personnel, IT
personnel, Paratransit Services and Competitive Services and Transportation Contracts. This
amendment will consolidate all leased space into one lease, will add approximately 3,046 sq. ft.
to the 6th floor and will amend and extend all previous leases and amendments to provide for all
to expire on December 31, 2022. On the original 73,480 sq. ft., base rent began at $16.50 per
square foot base rent and has increased annually by $0.50 and will conclude in the final year of
the lease at $21.50 per sq. ft., January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. (Rent for the
remaining 11,423 sq. ft. will be $20.00 per sq. ft. in the final year). Funding for the space to be
used by the FasTracks program was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be
appropriated in future year budgets. Funding for the space to be used by the base system will be
appropriated in future year budgets.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to amend and extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional
Transportation District and CO-Denver Post Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center
Plaza, LLC and EOP-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650,
700, 1000, 1075 and 1099 on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 10th floors, containing approximately 84,903

Acquisition of Easements - Southwest Plaza
Transfer Center

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass the
attached resolution certifying easements as necessary for construction of the Southwest Plaza Transfer
Center project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain
law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the construction of the
Southwest Plaza Transfer project the right of way necessary for certain utility easements for the
construction of the project. Easement needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared
beginning the formal acquisition process. This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may
ultimately result in court proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the
acquisition of the easements identified, subject to any modifications or additions required by the
contractor and/or construction activities.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property,
including easements, for a public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent
domain. RTD staff and its outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and
adhere to these processes, which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in
court filing and eminent domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and
right of way plan specifies the property that has been delineated by design and authorizes the General
Manager and/or his designee to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Acquisition of right of way is included in the project budget for the Southwest Plaza Transfer Center
project.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2016
SOUTHWEST PLAZA TRANSFER CENTER PROJECT EASEMENT ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the Southwest Plaza
Transfer Center Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plan;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just
compensation to acquire the easements; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the identified easements and to obtain
immediate possession of the easements; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall
have the authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of
the easements as it deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title
38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by
the Southwest Plaza Transfer Center Project, although financially compensated
according to the law, makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a
sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public
purpose, that there is a public need and necessity to acquire the easements within
the corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are
for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as
the Board’s delagatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed
easements.

Packet Pg. 87

2.12.C

The Board directs that the RTD delagatees should negotiate in good faith for
the acquisition of the easements and if the delagatee is unable to acquire any
easement through good faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such
easement through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of
the easements as soon as permitted by law.
Made and adopted this ___ day of _________________, 2016.

Subject:

Approval of General Manager’s 2017 Goals

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approves the General Manager’s goals for 2017 as defined in the attached General
Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board formalized and approved the goal setting process for the General Manager.
That process defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General
Manager. Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the
General Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the
General Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual Joint Board and
Staff Advance Planning Session that occurs in the first quarter of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals utilizing the RTD
employee performance evaluation form consistent to all salaried RTD employees. This action item is to
formalize that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed the 2017 core and task goals with the General Manager and approved the goals as
amended at the June 28, 2016 committee meeting to move to the full Board for approval.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation form which identifies the five core
goals for 2017 and the three task goals for 2017. The attached General Manager Tactical Plan for 2017
is submitted as a supplement to this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact in approving the 2017 Goals.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the General Manager’s 2017 goals. This
approval completes the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee and the General Manager to amend the 2017 goals. This
will significantly delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.

EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS:
Performance in this goal was beyond the expectations of the position in one or more of the following areas: the objectives and/or
responsibilities were significantly expanded upon by the employee to better address the task; significant additional and unexpected tasks
were successfully accomplished; objectives were consistently met well ahead of the deadline in order to facilitate future progress;
innovations had a major effect on the division or organization. Not every goal has the potential for an “Exceeds Expectations” level of

Performance in this goal was consistently met. The objectives normally fell into the following area(s): the objective was accomplished and
was thorough and complete; and/or was accomplished efficiently; and/or met the deadlines; and/or was competently performed; and/or met
the quantity expectations; and/or met the quality expectations. Failure to meet any of these standards was typically due to conditions
outside the control of the employee.
NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
Performance in this goal failed to meet the minimum expectations of this position. The objectives always or frequently fell into one or more
of the following area(s): was not accomplished; was not accomplished by the deadline; was only accomplished due to other(s) performing
some or all of the portions of the task; was accomplished but quality was unacceptable; was accomplished but quantities were lower than
acceptable. This rating means that immediate and significant improvement is needed. An action plan to improve performance should be put
in place.

Proposed Tactical Plans for Strategic Goals/Priorities from March 5, 2016
RTD Board/Senior Leadership Team (SL T) Advance

Gen~neral Manager and CEO

On March 5, 2016, Board members and the SLT convened an Advance to mutually
discuss and agree upon strategic goals for the agency . These goals/priorities are meant to
drive the 2017 budget cycle. For example, goals established at the 2015 Advance are
driving the 2016 budget cycle and priorities.
The Board will recall that we came out of the Advance with three priorities:
•

Fiscal Sustainability (Strategic Goal # 1)

•

Workforce/Human Capital (Strategic Goal #2)

•

State of Good Repair (Strategic Goal #3)

In accordance with the Board Policy on the Goal Setting process for the General Manager,
the General Manager is to present the agreed upon goals/priorities with his tactical plan to
implement those priorities/goals at the April 26, 2016 Board Study Session.
I will present the tactical plan at the Board Study Session on Tuesday, April 26, 2016. In
advance of the short presentation at the Committee, please find attached the proposed
tactical plans that staff proposes to implement to realize the strategic goals set forth.
As always, we welcome your input/feedback.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2017
Strategic Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability
Background
Throughout its history, RTD has had to adapt its service levels and capital programs to
different financial conditions due to the variability in sales and use taxes, its largest source
of revenue. One of the strategic goals established by the RTD Board for 2017 relates to
fiscal sustainability. The Board and staff identified the following specific focus areas:







Building Reserves
Discuss Impacts
Maintain Service Levels
Monitoring
Live within our Means
Identify new revenue sources

Building Reserves
The Board has adopted 2016 Fiscal Policies which includes a Fund Balance Policy. This
policy states the following:
 RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures. The unrestricted fund
balance will be comprised of a Board Appropriated Fund, a Capital Replacement
Fund, and an Undesignated Working Capital Fund. For the Base System, the total
of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal to
three (3) months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For
FasTracks, the total of these three (3) funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to two (2) months of FasTracks operating funds excluding
depreciation. RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions
allow. At the end of Calendar Year 2015, the Base System had a fund balance, as
prescribed above, of $79.5 million.
Based on three months of operating
expenditures that amount for year end 2015 should have been $104 million.
FasTracks had a fund balance, as prescribed above, of $18 million. The Base
System is not scheduled to reach the three month threshold until the end of
Calendar Year 2019.
In recent years, RTD has seen significant growth in the sales and use tax, i.e., 9.8% in
2014 and 5.2% in 2015. This level of growth won’t last forever and consideration should
be given to meeting the three months fund balance sooner rather than later. In addition,
RTD should consider establishing an operating reserve that would be budgeted each year
to be more responsive to forecasted revenues verses actual revenues. This would allow
for more flexibility in dealing with revenue changes as they could be adjusted through the
reserve rather than cutting back previously approved projects or service levels.
Building reserves would allow for more flexibility in dealing with future revenue shortfalls

2.12.D.c

which is important because of the inherent economic volatility of the district’s largest
revenue source, sales tax. Growth of these reserves requires discipline to set aside funds
in the short term rather than spending the funds on service in the short term. This shortterm constraint on spending is a strategic effort to improve the long term fiscal
sustainability of RTD.
Discuss Impacts
Each year RTD staff updates the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), a six year plan for the Base
system, and the Annual Program Evaluation (APE), a long range plan (2040) for FasTracks.
In addition to being utilized for the DRCOG Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) and
Long Range Plan (LRP), it provides a snapshot each year for the RTD Board and Staff to
plan for the future and understand the impacts of decisions that have been made and
those that are made today, and the impact on future revenues and operations. The SBP
becomes the basis for the annual budget each year. To remain fiscally sustainable, RTD
must annually balance the SBP while meeting service needs, addressing state of good
repair and building reserves.
Maintain Service Levels
Maintaining existing service levels is paramount to our customers especially with the
opening of five new lines of service in 2016. Unfortunately, service cuts have had to
occur in the not so distant past. In 2009, a service reduction of 6% was needed and
again in 2012 an 8% service reduction was implemented. Fortunately with steadily
increasing sales and use tax revenue since 2009, RTD has not had to make additional
service cuts. However at some point in the future, revenues will not increase at the
current rate and with the opening of five new service lines, operating and maintenance
costs will increase.
One of the ways to combat having to make service reductions is to have sufficient
reserves to be able to withstand fluctuations in the economy. As mentioned above, it is
prudent when economic conditions are favorable, as they are now, to make sure that
reserves are adequately funded so that service reductions are not required in the future to
balance the budget.
Monitoring
Monitoring of RTD’s financial condition is done at a variety of levels. Each month the
Board of Directors is provided a monthly financial report. The monthly financial report is
reviewed at the Finance and Administration committee each month. This report details
budget to actual both on a monthly basis as well as a year to date basis. This report also
contains a status of net position as well as an up to date accounting of the FISA. In
addition, beginning in mid-2015 staff began forecasting year end revenue shortfalls/
surpluses based on forecasts verses actuals.
At a staff level, monthly reports are provided by Accounting to the AGMs and budget
analysts so that expenditures can be monitored and corrective action taken. In addition,

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan for 2017 Goal #1 - Fiscal Sustainability Final (2855 : Approval of General Manager?s 2017 Goals)

2.12.D.c

Packet Pg. 103

each quarter in accordance with the Management Directive on Variance Reporting, each
Department head is required to submit an explanation to budget regarding any variance
between planned and actual expenditures that is +/- 10% and $100,000 or is deemed to
be material. This directive is intended to ensure that any issues are identified early in the
process and adjustments can be made to stay within budget.
Live within our Means
According to MoneyTalksNews.com there are 10 ways to make sure you can live within
your means.











Know your income and expenses
Track your expenses
Separate wants and needs
Don’t compete “with the Joneses”
Pay in cash
Keep an emergency fund
Save money wherever possible
Cut down on expenses
Boost your income
Don’t deprive yourself

Although these ways are intended for personal use, they are very applicable to RTD. As
was discussed above in both impacts and monitoring, RTD needs to develop a budget and
then monitor revenues and expenditures to ensure that if revenues are not meeting
expectations or expenditures are higher than anticipated then corrective action is taken
before it is too late.
The SBP project selection process is designed to try to separate the wants from what is
really needed to maintain, operate, and sustain the RTD system. Projects are scored based
on how they meet RTD’s mission as well as the consequences of not doing the project.
The more difficult one is not competing with other agencies or what other governments
are providing. It is easy to want to provide additional services and the best new thing to
our customers, but RTD may not be able to afford those without jeopardizing existing
service and infrastructure.
RTD has issued debt to fund projects and assets. Currently all voter authorized debt has
been issued for the Base System and most of the voter authorized debt has been issued
for FasTracks. RTD needs to be prudent in issuing additional debt to make sure that it fits
in with both short and long term financial considerations.
In 2016, RTD is looking at cutting expenses that don’t affect service, such as travel, food,
and other operating items that are nice to have but aren’t necessary to provide service to
our customers.

Packet Pg. 104

In building our reserves, it was discussed that money should be saved when revenues are
healthy and reserve funds should be built in order to provide for shortfalls that will
eventually occur.
The next section discusses opportunities for increasing resources. RTD has a proven track
record of being able to find opportunities to increase revenues.
The last item is “don’t deprive yourself.” There is such a thing as being too lean. RTD
needs to ensure that our system is safe and the infrastructure is being maintained.
Identification of New Revenue Sources
To date, RTD has implemented many things that have helped increase existing revenue
sources. They are:
 Increased sales tax revenue through exemption parity with the State
 January 1, 2016 implementation of the new fare structure and rates
 Implemented a naming rights program
Partnerships





Implementation of public private partnerships (P3) proposals for FasTracks, and for
other projects that provide benefits to RTD and fit within the financial plans
Pursuit of partnerships with FasTracks stakeholders to obtain additional local match
funds to complete FasTracks corridors
Leasing and contracting for the operation and management of assets that can be
operated by third parties at a cost savings, such as parking facilities
Development of shared facilities including parking, transfer centers, plazas,
walkways and bike-facilities at transit oriented or joint development projects where
RTD and developers can combine resources and reduce costs for site development
and amenities and operating cost

Other Opportunities






Pursuit of a long-term solution to maintaining and operating on the 16th Street Mall
Endorsing and supporting efforts to collect sales tax revenues on internet sales
Sale of assets and easements that do not interfere with existing or future RTD
operations
Sale of other assets not required for transit purposes
Continued pursuit of federal and state competitive grants as opportunities arise

In March of 2013 RTD and the Union executed a five year agreement. That agreement is
scheduled to expire in February of 2018. In the latter half of 2017, RTD and the Union
will commence negotiations for the next contract. Covered in the agreements are such
things as:
 Pension
 Health and Welfare Trust
 Salary and Progression
 Working Conditions
In early 2017, we will initiate a negotiating team workgroup to begin the framework for
negotiations. Economic challenges are anticipated to address wages, pension, and health
and welfare.
Health and Welfare
The Union Health and Welfare Trust are governed by six Trustees. Three are appointed by
the Union and three are appointed by the General Manager. This governing body is
responsible for making plan decisions such as the employee contributions, deductibles, and
co-pays. These decisions of course affect the cost of the plans to both RTD and the
employees.
Over the last couple of years it has become apparent that this plan has become less and
less solvent. In 2015, the plan was struggling to meet its monthly obligations and health
care providers were being paid months in arrears. The Trustees met and made some plan
changes in late 2015, which are projected to allow the plan to remain solvent at least
through 2016. The Health and Welfare plan will have to be addressed in the next contract
negotiations with the Union.
Morale
The 2015 All Employee Survey indicated a large percentage of employees are engaged and
sense a feeling of enablement. However, approximately 40% of employees have low
levels of both engagement and enablement which may contribute to low morale. The
survey also indicated that communication up and down the chain of command and across
work groups can be improved. Additional survey responses from employees regarding
strategy, vision and decision-making at RTD were identified as areas for improvement.
RTD has undertaken three continuous improvement pilots to address morale issues
revealed in the Employee Survey and explore different paths to address the concerns
voiced in the survey.
Customer Care and Platte Bus Maintenance with support from policy analysis staff are
piloting process improvement training and facilitation called RTD Peak Academy (modeled
on the City and County of Denver’s Peak Academy lean process improvement
methodology). These trainings and continued support through Innovation Labs and
specialized workshops aim to give employees at every level of the organization tools to
identify and eliminate waste and coaching to propose innovations that serve internal and

Additionally, the Rail Operations Department has begun an intra-departmental pilot focused
on identifying and exploring employee concerns with monthly meetings modelled on the
successful Safety Meetings RTD has conducted for years. The policy analysis group is also
piloting a new tool, RTD Connect, for bus and rail operators to interface with support
staff.
Continuous improvement methods designed to create employee resolution and ownership
will continue throughout the organization. A follow-up survey will be conducted in 2017
to measure improvement from the baseline established in 2015.
Recruitment and Retention
As the economy has improved and unemployment has dropped to under 3% in the Denver
Metro area, recruiting has become much more challenging particularly in the areas of bus
operators, light rail operators, and mechanics. Hiring qualified applicants is not just a
Human Resource function, so recognizing that, RTD established a Recruitment and
Retention Working Group late last summer. This group is tasked with working together to
improve our recruitment process and working on ways to increase retention. Members of
that working group include: AGM of Rail, AGM of Bus, AGM of Communications, AGM of
Finance and Administration, HR, Marketing, State of Good Repair, and Bus Operations.
The following improvements have been made:
 “RTD is Hiring” messages on all buses and RTD vehicles.
 Advertising on billboards
 RTD Hiring Bus
 Holding “One-Stop” Hiring sessions on weekends and weeknights
 Hiring Bonus of $2,000
 Referral Bonus of $1,000
 Increase in shift differential and split shift pay
Since the inception of these changes late last year, the number of new applicants has
increased by 89.3% and new hires in the targeted areas has increased by 83.6%.1
Continued efforts include:
 Targeting specific sectors of the community that might produce more applicants for
bus operators, light rail operators, and mechanics.
 More research on what attracts people to RTD so we can appeal to that dynamic
 Looking at pay and benefits for these occupational groups through future CBA
negotiations
Efforts thus far, have been to focus on recruitment with several items focused on
retention. A recent review showed that approximately 7% of bus operators left within the
first 18 months. We are closely monitoring recruitment and retention vis-a-vis the
improvements made to date.

RTD has a very robust training and development program. Each salaried employee is
offered $2,000/ year and each represented employee is offered $1,500/year towards
education and training. In addition, RTD offers “free of charge” classes such as Word,
Excel, Power Point, and other classes to provide job enrichment. RTD also has the
Leadership Academy and the MAX program.
The Leadership Academy is designed to support RTD’s emerging leaders by focusing on
the relationship of mission, values, culture, and strategic priorities. Members of this oneyear educational program engage in a comprehensive coursework that provides them with
the tools and resources to successfully guide RTD in the coming years. Employees
selected for the program benefit from professional training and mentoring. By offering a
dynamic environment for the development of leadership mastery, organizational
stewardship, business fundamentals, and technical competencies, the Leadership
Academy promotes the advancement of RTD employees. Since its inception 95 current
employees have completed the program. The 2016 Leadership Academy class has 25
employees who will graduate in December of 2016 increasing the total number of
employees who have completed the program to 120.
The Multi-Agency Exchange Program (MAX) is a program designed to create future Transit
Leaders and to provide the public with continuity through the evolution of the industry and
the needs of our patrons. MAX is designed to leverage best practices of the industry in
order to minimize the learning curve and reduce the cost and time to implement new
programs. MAX participants are from RTD, Dallas, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Current RTD
participants in the program must also be graduates of the Leadership Academy.
Goals of the MAX Program are to (1) Provide a better understanding of transit industry
needs between agencies (2) Create an environment that provides a positive network for
learning and support in our unique industry (3) Provide a safe platform for candid
interactions between all agencies (4) Define high impact areas within our agencies,
including: Safety, Run cutting, Operations, Human Resources, and Capital Programs. The
4 agencies of the 2016 MAX program are focusing on Security, Recruitment and
Retention, and Employee Development as high impact areas. Since its inception in 2011,
26 current RTD employees have completed the program.
We are exploring the feasibility of an agency-wide mentoring program for employee
development utilizing Leadership Academy graduates as the core cadre for the program.
We are working on an advanced program learning path for graduates of the Leadership
Academy and the MAX program that would include a combination of newly developed
internal classes as well as external leadership programs such as Leadership APTA and Eno
Foundation courses.
We are continuing, in partnership with IT, to seek a platform to deliver computer based
training (CBT) that will communicate with our Oracle Learning Management system.
Managers/senior leaders from other departments either have developed or would like to
partner with Education CBT training courses in areas such as, but not limited to Ethics,

Succession Planning
Over 54% of RTD’s workforce is over the age of 50, including 4 employees over the age
of 80. Although employees seem to be working longer, eventually they will leave taking
years of knowledge with them. Two of the efforts that are intended to assist with
succession planning are the Leadership Academy and the MAX program. Another large
issue that needs to be addressed is Information Governance. Many RTD employees are
vested and eligible to retire. Knowledge management and retention of institutional
knowledge is critical to the continuity of business and it is imperative that RTD develop
and implement systems and processes to capture this historical information. That
information needs to be available to new employees in the form of Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) and the ability to access past information. The ECM project authorized
by the Board last year is a key mechanism to address SOPs and provide ready access to
information.
In 2012, each major department began identifying key positions and the associated
requisite skills within their department. As these become clearly identified and included
into SOPs, development paths can be created for employees who wish to move into those
positions. All departments will update their leadership and succession plans in 2017.
Recognition
One of the 2013 Leadership Academy class projects was entitled “Employee Value
Program.” The team developed a project vision to describe the intended outcome of the
program. It was, “To have and keep happy employees by engaging both employees and
managers.” This vision was supported by the program mission: “To use spot on
recognition to motivate employees to provide safe, reliable, and courteous service.” The
project team also developed specific goals to measure the effectiveness of the Employee
Value Program:




To encourage goal alignment from top to bottom throughout District
To encourage the documentation of criteria so employees know what to work
towards and can easily reference those goals and criteria.
Improve recognition delivery and tracking, making the reward effective and
meaningful.

Based on the research and the employee survey, the project group developed
recommendations for an on-going Employee Value Program:
 Continuation and enhancement of existing formal recognition programs
 Establishment of informal recognition programs
 Development of employee recognition training for all managers and supervisors at
RTD
 Establishment of a permanent rotating Employee Recognition Committee to oversee
the Program

As part of this project, an employee survey was conducted and an implementation plan
developed. To date, this project hasn’t been implemented. We will review this work in
2017 and determine if this or a like plan should be initiated.
Working Conditions
RTD employees work in a variety of settings including: on-board operators; maintainers at
maintenance divisions; field staff working on maintenance, landscaping, infrastructure, and
field supervision; and office environments. Management staff maintains facilities and
working conditions to provide good work environments per work classification categories.
RTD employees are also subject to a variety of policies, procedures and rules depending on
work assignment. Efforts are made to make work policy effective and provide good
working conditions. RTD conducted stay interviews with front line workers to determine
employees concerns.

From the Stay interviews conducted by ET&D, LR and HR, front line workers raised
concerns about rest breaks/relief stations and the demanding schedule that
prevents the opportunity to take advantage of them. Operators understand the
necessity for split shifts; however, some split schedules are too lengthy, stretching
out their days considerably.
Safety was brought up, with some operators suggesting a driver “barrier” would
make them feel safer (a barrier to separate operators from the public on buses),
while others prefer no barrier.
Consistency in supervisor treatment was raised, for example some supervisors
demanding specifics for the reason the driver is calling in sick.
Complaints come to the attention of the driver immediately; compliments take too
long.
The extra board is difficult for a new driver.

We will continue to monitor work areas and work policy to create efficient and desirable
working conditions.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2017
Strategic Goal #3
State of Good Repair – O&M
Background
In 2017 RTD will experience expanded operations and maintenance resulting from the
opening of five lines in 2016 and continued emphasis on the base system. At the same
time, our Asset Management and State of Good Repair program matures to encompass all
asset types.
RTD relies heavily on physical assets and exercising life-cycle management principles for
better operating results, system performance and efficiency. Assets exist to support the
delivery of transit service, so their value is dependent on RTD’s objectives, expectations
and system needs.
Asset Management consistently applied from the highest levels enables RTD to work
collectively and more effectively in realizing and extracting value from our assets. Asset
management, because of its interplay with other agency functions, provides an excellent
catalyst for the integration of all organizational strategies, goals and objectives.
Good asset management or State of Good Repair is a strategic data-driven approach that
guides our investments, resources, and policy decisions to achieve goals. Results help us
highlight areas of challenge, identify necessary adjustments, and communicate measured
success. International Standards Organization or ISO 55000 is one of the best examples of
the application of organizational management system and subsequently, supports working
towards achieving and maintaining a “state of good repair”. The descriptions below
provide the tactical approaches to accomplish this board goal while supporting and aligning
with RTD’s missions and all other agency goals.
The objective of RTD’s State of Good Repair program is to optimize the use or value from
our assets at the lowest possible cost of ownership while managing other risks.
Certification to the ISO 55000 Standard will provide evidence that RTD’s investment and
expenditure on assets meets with this overall objective and is in alignment with RTD’s
overall business strategy. Moving this goal forward also demonstrates to both regulators
and other stakeholders that assets are being appropriately maintained while addressing
short, medium and long term risks. In addition, independent certification provides evidence
of compliance to safety critical systems and procedures.
ISO 55000 is the highest standard in obtaining optimum value from physical assets, RTD
should begin pursuit as the next step in its strategic approach to asset management.
Benefits from the goal of State of Good Repair and the ISO standard encompass the
following aspects:




Safety and Reliability
Maintaining What we have
Ensure Service & Accessibility

Safety & Reliability
We continue to view safety as our #1 priority. RTD has an unwavering commitment to
provide safe services to our customers and stakeholders. RTD will implement the FTA’s
mandated Safety Management System framework including:




Dashboard safety reports
Document and implement the Asset Management / State of Good Repair safety
connection
Creation of automated system notifications of asset requiring further safety
evaluations

The Nexus between State of Good Repair and Safety was established with the passage of
MAP-21. The FTA adopted the principles and methods of Public Transportation Safety
Management Systems to guide its development and implementation. Safety Management
System (SMS) is a comprehensive, collaborative organization-wide data-driven approach to
managing safety risk. This system will build on RTD’s existing safety foundation to
mitigate risk, detect and proactively correct safety problems, share and analyze safety
data more effectively, and measure safety performance more carefully. SMS is the formal,
top-down business approach to managing safety risk, which includes a systemic approach
to managing safety, including the necessary organizational structures, accountabilities,
policies and procedures.
A fundamental aspect of RTD’s Asset Management program is the monitoring of asset
condition and performance as an indicator of system health. The data derived from
condition assessments inform the RTD of some practices related to SMS, to the extent
that an asset's condition could impact its safety. Maintaining assets in a state of good
repair will drive high reliability.
Maintaining What We Have
The operations and maintenance areas within departments do an exceptional job
maintaining what we have through established maintenance programs. RTD will continue
to utilize current maintenance programs and continue to submit strategic budget plan
(SBP) projects to maintain assets in a state of good repair. It should be noted that many
SBP projects that are submitted are deferred due to a lack of resources. This has been a
recurring concern during the SBP process for the last several years. RTD prioritizes SBP
requests, however, resource limitations prevent all projects, some of which may be linked
to state of good repair, from being addressed.
Since RTD relies heavily on physical assets, exercising a life-cycle management approach
creates better operating results, system performance and ultimately lower costs. The
lifecycle management and maintenance of all assets involves a common set of elements.

In order to achieve and maintain a “State of Good repair” evaluation of the lifecycle cost,
physical condition, and performance of each class of assets is necessary. This data-driven
practice aims to maximize asset performance, minimize the total cost of ownership, and
manage risks. These elements are common to all asset classes, but differ in
implementation. Steps to achieving this goal include:






Complete asset register capturing all necessary attributes
Identify asset and business risks
Evaluate all current maintenance strategies and plans
Measure and analyze age, cost, condition and performance of all rolling stock,
infrastructure and facilities, and
Generate an annual report on RTD’s state of good repair.

Ensure Service & Accessibility (see also Maintain Service Levels)
In order to ensure that services continue to meet the ever-changing needs of our
communities, we must focus on reliability and accessibility. In addition to these objectives
RTD implements service changes three times per year. These changes compounded with
the opening of 5 lines will necessitate emphasis be placed specifically on our service &
accessibility. We will continue to focus on service planning to:



Comply with service standards,
Measure productive of service by route / line – insure expansion and cuts follow a
policy related to highest service and accessibility standards.

Service and accessibility are dependent on our system availability and maintenance. We
will continue to recruit and retain employees to assure delivery of service, and we will
continue with maintenance programs so that assets are available and accessibility is
preserved.
Maintain Infrastructure
Maintaining the condition of our transit infrastructure is critical for RTD and one that poses
pressing challenges for most of the Nation’s transit systems. RTD has several categories
of infrastructure: rail and bus maintenance facilities; track, power, signal and
communication systems; stations and park-n-rides; and various IT and security-related
systems. RTD’s bus maintenance divisions are approximately 30-40 years old and present
a variety of on-going maintenance challenges. Many of these challenges are addressed
through SBP projects, however, it is important to realize the age of these facilities and plan
for the long-term replacement as well as day-to-day maintenance. The original light rail
system is now over 20 years old and beginning to require some replacement and major
maintenance activities as well as day-to-day work. The focus of RTD’s SBP program
should prioritize infrastructure maintenance.

The Board of Directors and RTD staff have taken the lead in the industry to comply with
MAP-21 and Fast Act established and forthcoming standards. The final State of Good
Repair / Asset Management rule making is expected in mid-2017 and RTD has been
intimately involved at the national level in shaping this legislation. The goal is that RTD
will be fully compliant and meet the implementation schedules set forth by the FTA, and
Department of Transportation. As industry leaders the secondary goal is to examine the
benefits of the full implementation of the ISO 55000 international standard. Because the
ISO standard is the highest standard in obtaining optimum value from physical assets, RTD
will pursue it as the next step in its strategic approach to asset management. Long-term
benefits from the standard encompass the following aspects:




Maintain Facilities
RTD has thousands of facilities and related assets that range in age from over decades old
to new construction. Maintaining the condition of our transit facilities is critical for the
safe and reliable delivery of service. The operations and maintenance areas within
departments do an exceptional job maintaining what we have through established
maintenance programs. RTD will continue to utilize current maintenance programs and
continue to submit strategic budget plan (SBP) projects to maintain assets in a state of
good repair.
Since RTD relies heavily on physical assets exercising a life-cycle management approach
supports better operating results, system performance and ultimately lower costs. The
lifecycle management and maintenance of all facilities assets involves a common set of
elements. In order to achieve and maintain a “State of Good repair” evaluation of the
lifecycle cost, physical condition, and performance of each class of assets is necessary.
The link between life-cycle management expenditures such as rehabilitation, preventive
maintenance, and unplanned maintenance to asset performance include mean cost per
square foot and frequency and time out of service. This data-driven practice aims to
maximize asset performance, minimize the total cost of ownership, and manage risks.
These elements are common to all asset classes, but differ in implementation. Steps to
achieving this goal include:




Complete asset register capturing all necessary attributes
Identify asset and business risks
Measure and analyze age, cost, condition and performance of all facilities.
