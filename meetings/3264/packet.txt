BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Paratransit Scheduling and Management System

Committee Meeting Date:
November 9, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
November 9, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
three-year contract with seven one-year options with HBSS Connect Corp (HBSS) for an amount not to
exceed $4,000,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2008, RTD began using RouteMatch software to schedule paratransit service. The software has
become obsolete as it does not offer functions and capabilities necessary in a responsive operating
environment and lacks key features that are standard in similar software platforms, such as mobile or
web portal trip booking for customers. Further, the existing software platform is unable to provide
continuous real-time trip negotiation during peak-hour demand. The agency developed its own portals to
address some of these shortcomings, but ongoing internal support is costly and staff-resource intensive.
Additionally, RouteMatch has developed a new cloud-based product and will cease to support the
existing system at some point in the future.
The increased efficiency of a new paratransit software platform would improve productivity over the
current system, thereby creating between $2,000,000 and $4,000,000 in savings each year that could
instead be used for ongoing software support. In April 2021, the Board of Directors approved a budget
transfer of $4,000,000 for 2022 to fund the software replacement.
DISCUSSION
A request for proposals for a paratransit software platform was released on August 3, 2021. Three
proposals were received from Ecolane, HBSS Connect Corp (HBSS), and Spare Labs on September 21,
2021 and were evaluated by staff and members of the disability community. Based upon the evaluation
criteria and technical demonstrations, HBSS was selected as the most qualified proposer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional budgetary impact following the transfer approved by the Board in April 2021 to
fund the software replacement.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:

Purchase of 17 40-Foot Battery Electric Buses

Board Meeting Date:
November 9, 2021
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with New Flyer to purchase 17 40-foot battery electric buses, along with associated optional
equipment, spare parts, specialty tools, training and extended warranties in an amount not to exceed
$18,016,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was awarded a grant from the Federal Transit Administration,
as well as a grant from the Colorado Department of Transportation, to purchase 17 battery electric
buses, intended to replace existing diesel buses that have been in service more than 13 years and have
traveled an average of more than 600,000 miles under rigorous use.
DISCUSSION
A request for proposals was issued on May 7, 2021, and on September 1, 2021 the agency received
five proposals from the following manufacturers: BYD USA; Gillig; New Flyer of North America, Inc.
(New Flyer); Nova Bus and Proterra.
The proposers submitted costs per bus as highlighted below:
BYD USA
$838,902

Gillig
$1,037,646

New Flyer
$879,000

Nova Bus
$880,895

Proterra
$919,726

Staff assessed the proposals according to the following criteria:
• Total Contract Cost
• Compliance with technical specifications
• Qualifications
• Lifecycle costs
The proposal submitted by New Flyer received the highest overall combined evaluation rating amongst
the proposals.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

The 40-foot battery electric buses are equipped similarly to those of recently procured 40-foot diesel
buses and includes a seating configuration with areas to maximize space for customers with mobility
devices. The buses will have electric traction motor propulsion with an energy storage system capacity
of 437 kWh, which allows for an estimated maximum range of up to 213 miles under ideal
environmental and operating conditions.
The buses will be deployed for fixed route service from the East Metro Division located at 14100 East
Colfax in Aurora and will be assigned to blocks (i.e., a group of bus trips scheduled for a specific vehicle)
within the buses’ operational capability and range limitations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Total costs including the 17 battery electric buses, associated equipment, spare parts, specialty tools,
training and extended warranties will not exceed $18,016,000.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Award of Group 31 Contracted Fixed-Route Services

Committee Meeting Date:
November 9, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
November 9, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
three-year contract with two one-year options with First Transit (contractor) for the provision of Group
31 fixed-route transit service. The total five-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted service and
associated fuel costs purchased at a contracted rate is $191,591,304.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Greg Smith, Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to § 32-9-119.5(2)(a), C.R.S., RTD operates a system under which up to 58% of the district’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses, nonprofit organizations, or local
governments pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts. The agency currently contracts
approximately 45% of fixed-route service, 100% of complementary paratransit service (Access-a-Ride),
and 100% of FlexRide service, for a total amount of contracted transit service of approximately 56%.
The first contract for the provision of contracted fixed-route services was referred to as the “Group 1”
contract, and each subsequent contract was given a higher number. The service contract referred to as
“Group 31” replaces the Group 27 service contract, which will expire on May 12, 2022. The Group 31
service package consists of 128 buses operating 31 routes that travel through Arvada, Aurora, Boulder,
Broomfield, Commerce City, Denver, Englewood, Federal Heights, Glendale, Golden, Lakewood,
Littleton, Longmont, Louisville, Lafayette, Northglenn, Thornton, Westminster and Wheat Ridge,
providing approximately 342,901 revenue hours per year.
DISCUSSION
One contractor submitted a formal proposal on August 27, 2021. The contractor also currently operates
the Group 27 fixed-route service package.
Cost Analysis
An internal financial analysis indicated that the five-year estimated cost for RTD to provide Group 31
services internally would be $214,909,769, $23,318,465 higher than the five-year cost proposed by
the contractor:

Moreover, RTD does not currently have available operations and maintenance facilities or the human
resources capacity to support the additional service contemplated in the Group 31 contract.
The contractor’s proposal was evaluated according to established criteria and was found to meet or
exceed all business requirements cited in the scope of work. The contract was awarded accordingly,
with an effective date of May 13, 2022.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The costs for the provision of Group 31 service and associated fuel costs are as follows:

Funds for the provision of the prorated 2022 portion of the first year of service under this contract will
be included in the 2022 budget.
RTD will require the contractor to purchase fuel for the provision of Group 31 service from RTD’s
supplier at the agency’s contracted rate.

PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On July 19, 2018, Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published the PTASP Final Rule, which requires
each operator of a public transportation system that receives federal funds under FTA's Urbanized Area
Formula Grants to develop a PTASP that includes the processes and procedures necessary to implement
a Safety Management System.

• Alignment with 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, including mission, vision, values, and strategic
priorities
• Alignment with current agency structure
• Incorporation of line management accountability
• Cross-organizational coordination
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact related to the adoption of the 2022 PTASP.

Policy

The first element of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) is Safety Policy. This, in its most
simple form, is the safety policy developed, approved, and signed by the Regional Transportation District
(RTD), a multimodal agency comprising bus, light rail, commuter rail, and special services in the Denver
metro area. This element also describes RTD’s commitment to safety; its objectives, safety goals, and the
organizational structure established; and plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
In August 2021, the RTD Board of Directors adopted a new strategic plan that looks toward the next five
years of the agency’s future. The document­­—against which all initiatives, projects, and priorities will be
measured—serves as a blueprint for success and outlines the intentionality RTD will bring with its redefined
mission: “We make lives better through connections.”
The strategic plan was developed by General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson and RTD’s executive
leadership team in concert with the agency’s 15-member Board of Directors. It establishes four strategic
priorities—community value, customer excellence, employee ownership, and financial success—that serve
as functional pillars to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure RTD’s overall performance.
Development of the PTASP was completed in accordance with RTD’s strategic plan; Title 49 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 672, 673, and 674; and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) State
Safety Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and Standards.
RTD has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety throughout the
organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four elements as described in the following table:
SMS Element

Description

Safety Policy

Definition of safety policies, procedures, and organizational structure

Safety Risk Management

Formal process for management of hazards to an acceptable level of risk

Safety Assurance

Establishment of process measures, assessments, and controls to assess the
effectiveness of risk control strategies

Safety Promotion

Safety training and risk communication practices to promote a culture of safety

1.1.2

Authority

RTD is a special transportation district of the state of Colorado and is authorized under Colorado Revised
Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the district has its own taxing authority and operates within the
counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and Weld. The agency is
governed by its elected Board of Directors and managed by the General Manager and CEO, who develops
and implements a comprehensive and integrated PTASP. To that end, the General Manager, by signature
authority of the district’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD Chief Safety Officer (CSO) to
develop and implement a PTASP as an operating document of the agency for all modes of operations,
including commuter rail, light rail, and bus/paratransit. RTD’s contractors are also governed as applicable

1. POLICY

1.B.4.a

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) recognizes the CPUC as the state safety oversight agency for
RTD. CPUC-SSO is FTA’s certified safety oversight agency, working cooperatively to regulate RTD’s light
rail transit, by ensuring compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance, as
applicable.
The FTA functions as both a funding administrator and as a federal regulator as defined by 49 CFR Parts
670, 672, 673, and 674. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the state safety oversight agency (CPUCSSOA), to determine the SSO’s and RTD’s compliance to the FTA’s general requirements. RTD’s light rail
service is regulated by the FTA and CPUC-SSO agencies.
RTD’s commuter rail service is fully regulated by the FRA and is not regulated by the CPUC-SSO (except for
at-grade crossings) or the FTA.

1.1.3

Policy Statement

As the accountable executive for all operations and activities, I will ensure that resources are available
to make the SMS robust and successful. RTD executive leadership will take steps to prevent workplace
incidents, injuries, and illnesses and will provide support of safety program initiatives. RTD will consider
employee suggestions for achieving a safer, healthier workplace; keep informed about workplace safety
and health hazards; and regularly review the agency’s safety programs.
RTD is committed to:
●

Integrating safety management among the primary responsibilities of all managers and employees

●

Clearly defining accountabilities, expectations, and responsibilities for the delivery of RTD’s SMS
performance for all levels of staff

●

Supporting the SMS with appropriate human and financial resources

●

Developing an organizational culture that fosters safe practices, and encourages effective
employee safety reporting and communication

●

Enhancing hazard identification, analysis, and safety risk evaluation activities, including an
employee safety reporting program, to eliminate or mitigate the safety risks resulting from all
activities to a level of safety as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP)

●

Complying with federal, state, and RTD safety-related requirements, rules, and standards

●

Ensuring that all staff are provided with appropriate safety-related information, equipment, and
training

●

under this PTASP, which is not intended to conflict with or supersede Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) regulations.

RTD managers and supervisors are responsible for communicating this policy to employees supervising
and training workers in safe work practices. They are expected to reinforce safe work, behaviors, and
compliance with agency safety rules and to work to eliminate hazardous conditions. Managers and
supervisors will lead safety efforts by example.
All RTD employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities, including reporting
hazards, unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a safety
committee/department representative.
Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports any
accident, incident, near miss, concern, or hazard. All employees are required to abide by the standards and
procedures set forth in the SMS policy and the PTASP. Behaviors such as illegal activity, negligence, acts of
willful misconduct, or undue care and attention shall be considered outside the scope of this policy.
The SMS Program is managed under my authority by the CSO, who has direct access to me. All levels of
management and all employees are accountable for the delivery of the highest level of safety performance,
starting with the General Manager and CEO.

1.B.4.a

1.B.4.a

The overall consideration in the development of the agency’s PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of customers throughout the transit system. The customers and the general public must be
confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to design,
construct, and maintain a system that aims to reduce recognized hazards as much as practicable with the
safety of employees, customers, and the general public in mind. RTD’s objectives will be met by drawing
information from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific agency
requirements into an SMS to ensure a safe transportation system.
RTD’s safety performance targets for 2022 are:
●

Preventable accident rate per 100,000 miles:
○

Bus, less than 1.0

○

Light rail, less than 1.0

●

5% reduction of lost time days due to On-the-Job Injuries (OJIs)

●

5% reduction of OJIs

●

○

5% reduction of slip and fall injuries

○

5% reduction of injuries from strains

Measure and hold to current levels of performance for system reliability without decline in reliability
or increases in costs as described in the current Transit Asset Management Plan (TAMP).

Specific activities to achieve these safety performance targets for the 2022 calendar year include the following:
●

Continue developing, formalizing, and maturing the SMS, focusing on key processes that will
improve and strengthen RTD’s efforts

●

Implement the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedure

●

Implement leadership and employee safety skills training

●

Implement pre-job safety briefings for high-risk and non-routine activities and tasks

1.2.1

Goals

The CSO, in collaboration with the agency’s Chiefs and Assistant General Managers (AGMs), is responsible
for the development of goals and safety performance targets for the PTASP. The CSO has direct access to
the Accountable Executive/GM/CEO on compliance with the PTASP. The PTASP’s intent is to:
●

Establish a clearly defined safety management system with lines of authority and responsibility to
implement the program, processes, and policies that integrate safety into all aspects of RTD functions

●

Provide a means of measuring and achieving RTD safety goals and initiatives, and compliance with
rules and regulations

●

Provide multiple pathways for employees to report safety concerns, hazards, near misses, and
security concerns

●

Provide a comprehensive risk management program to effectively identify and resolve issues

●

Set procedures for review, approval, and documentation of system modifications to existing
systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment

●

Set processes to address safety issues for activation of new systems and modifications to existing

1.2 Goals and Safety Performance Targets

1.B.4.a

●

Establish standards for emergency preparedness and management

●

Conduct continual internal reviews and inspections to evaluate PTASP compliance

●

Measure compliance to safety rules and regulations that impact operations or maintenance

●

Conduct an ongoing maintenance inspections program of vehicles, equipment, facilities, and
maintenance cycles, with documentation and the integration of identified safety concerns into the
hazard management process

●

●

Establish a management of change/configuration management control process for modifications
during operations

1.2.2

Agency Safety Policies

Guided by the principles contained in this PTASP, the CSO, under the direction of the GM/CEO, develops,
reviews, and updates safety and risk control policies, processes, and procedures. These policies set
the framework for guiding the safety management system. All agency safety policies are available on
the intranet.

1.2.3

Integrating Safety into all Aspects of RTD

The objective of the SMS is the continual improvement of processes and operations to maximize safety to
the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual opportunities for employees
to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their operations, and supply each employee with
multiple means to identify potential hazards.
RTD accomplishes this through safety training, safety moments at meetings, safety committee meetings,
weekly safety messages, safety poster campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards, and proactive
reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety are presented. As examples:
● Safety is a part of Planning Department meetings to plan for safety in new projects at the
earliest opportunity
●

Safety participates in Transit Oriented Development meetings to identify and raise safety concerns

●

In new construction projects, safety is considered in the Construction Safety Committee, Design
and Construction Meeting, System Safety Working Group, and Activation Committee meetings

●

Safety has representation in the Technology Advisory Group in selection and implementation of
new technology programs

●

Safety works with Communications for signage, vehicle wraps, handouts, wristbands, billboards,
commercials, and social media to maximize safety messages to the community

●

Safety is incorporated into training in RTD’s divisions and conducts Roadway Worker Protection,
Safety Management System, and Security/Incident Command Structure training

●

Safety reviews procurements that involve safety-sensitive products or services and ensures proper
safety language is in all contracts

1.3 Overview of Management Structure
RTD Board of Directors and Executive Staff

RTD was created by the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 for the purpose of providing a public mass
transportation system for residents of the district. The agency began operations in 1972. A 15-member
elected Board of Directors is the legislative body for RTD and determines all questions of overall
governance and policy for RTD. The Board of Directors appoints the GM/CEO, who is ultimately responsible
for safety.
The GM/CEO has full charge of the acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operations of the system
and facilities of RTD, and of the administration of RTD business affairs. The GM/CEO supervises executive
staff, including Chief Officers and AGMs. Included among these officers is the Chief Operations Officer,
who is responsible for bus and rail transit operations. The CSO has the responsibility for agency safety. The
Safety Division reports monthly to the GM/CEO.
The following activities will assure that safety goals and objectives are achieved:
●

Perform timely review of accident and incident investigation summary reports to identify trends and
recommend corrective action to minimize loss

●

Review reports of system standard operating procedures and rules for compliance with
established guidelines

●

Review summary reports regarding periodic equipment and facility inspections, and system
hazard analysis

●

Management — Key Role in Safety Overview

The SMS will be incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by rail and bus service managers.
Safe operations of the bus and rail divisions are the responsibility of the AGMs. Each department has
an AGM or Chief Officer, who, along with Senior Managers, Managers, and Supervisors, is responsible
for implementing policies and procedures for safe operations. The AGMs of the rail and bus divisions
have charged their management teams to effectively manage safety; to develop safety programs, plans,
procedures, training, policies, and rules to govern safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP. Bus and rail
maintenance facilities are staffed with a Manager of Maintenance responsible for the safe operation of the
facility and are supported by Shift Supervisors and maintenance workers. RTD models policies, procedures,
and processes for occupational safety and health on Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) regulations.
Supervisors’ responsibilities place them at the forefront of RTD’s safety efforts. A significant portion of their
duties is monitoring, ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance and rules compliance, and promoting
a strong safety climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are RTD’s key
to improved safety-related behavior and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the responsibility to
monitor safety compliance of their employees and ensure employees understand their job functions and
the associated safety requirements.
RTD safety and health are managed at all levels of staff. All employees are trained in safety and job
duties, and are given responsibility for their own safety, as well as the safety of the individuals with whom
they work. All employees have the responsibility to halt an operation or stop work if it is deemed to be
unsafe. RTD’s system safety processes emphasize open and consistent dialogue between leaders and

Climate/Geography

The Denver metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined seasons.
Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not oppressive
since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the hottest month, with
temperatures reading 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are cold but usually not severe. The average
annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at Denver International Airport, but much higher amounts fall in
foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall but may be heavy in the
spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean move through the area more frequently than any other season
of the year.

1.4 PTASP Annual Updates, Revisions,
and Changes

1.B.4.a

Continuous improvement is defined by FTA as a process by which a transit agency examines safety
performance to identify safety deficiencies and carry out a plan to address the identified safety
deficiencies. RTD will use the management review cycle (annual PTASP update) along with performance
data for the SMS to identify and prioritize continuous improvement of each process. This method is
consistent with SMS’ principles and allows for the resourcing and prioritization of SMS efforts.

1.6 SMS Documentation and Records
Documentation and recordkeeping pertinent to each component or subcomponent of SMS is described
in the relevant section of the SMS. This subcomponent will also include changes for the management of
new or revised safety requirements from regulations or otherwise, such as the introduction of minimum
standards for safety. In addition, this subcomponent includes safety data and analyses, delivered to and
used by management for safety-related decision-making.

1.B.4.a

1.7 Integration with Public Safety and
Emergency Management
System Security Plan

The security program for RTD is described in the SSP, which is reviewed and graded in person by the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), on an annual basis.
The SSP is also reviewed and incorporated into a triennial agencywide “Base Assessment,” which includes
a physical inspection of random locations throughout the district. The Base Assessment ultimately results
in a scoring of the RTD security model, which is sent to TSA headquarters in Washington, D.C. The SSP is
considered sensitive security information (SSI) per 49 CFR Parts 15 and 1520, with distribution controlled
to only those with a need to know. The SSP complies with DHS guidance, including the National Response
Framework, National Incident Management System (NIMS), and National Preparedness Goal. For response
to terrorism or natural disaster incidents, the EMP is based on partnerships with the Urban Area Security
Initiative working group, and first-responder organizations of cities and counties throughout RTD’s service
area.
For traditional security functions as well as terrorism prevention, RTD’s plans are based upon a formally
adopted policy of awareness, observation, and reporting by all employees, especially frontline personnel,
combined with effective responses by both Security Operations Command and first-responder law
enforcement and emergency management organizations. Customers are also asked to report suspicious
behaviors or packages to employees, by contacting the Security Command Center, via the RTD Transit
Watch App for mobile phones, or by calling 911 in the event of an incident. RTD’s Transit Police Division
works in partnership with police and sheriff’s departments and federal partners throughout RTD’s service
area, for high responsiveness to calls for police assistance on the transit system, for application of the
Code of Conduct throughout the service area, and for effective criminal investigations and prosecutions.
In support of security awareness and reporting by transit system employees, RTD design criteria for new
service projects applies Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design principles and provides closedcircuit television and other equipment throughout the system to enhance security.

1.7.2

Emergency Management

The ability to respond quickly and in an organized manner is vital to the continuation of transit service
during a special event or emergency, or recovery from a catastrophic incident, including but not limited to
the following:
●

Earthquake

●

Fire

●

Flooding

●

Hazardous material spill

●

Medical emergency

●

Severe weather

●

1.7.1

1.B.4.a

●

Incident management – management of an emergency event or incident is based on the principles
of National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident Command System (ICS). NIMS
principles allow emergency response agencies to communicate with field supervisors and/or the
Security Command Center (SCC).

●

Coordination with external agencies – the Chief of Police and Emergency Management is
principally responsible for the coordination of incident management resources with various
emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction between RTD and those agencies.
Liaising with law enforcement agencies is primarily the responsibility of the CSO, with assistance
from the Chief of Police and Emergency Management.

●

Emergency response planning and mitigation – RTD establishes a FLSC for each new rail
extension or significant transit facility project. The committee comprises safety and security staff;
RTD operations, maintenance, and engineering representatives; and police, fire, emergency
medical, and other area emergency response agency representatives. The committee reviews
transit system designs and recommends fire protection, life safety and security measures, and
procedural response and training needs related to the new extension or facility project.

●

Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan area, RTD is
a member of the Regional Emergency Management and the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)
and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI). It is RTD’s intent to develop a task force with regional
emergency management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response, recovery,
and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the metropolitan area,
emergency response agencies, utility companies, and other critical groups. RTD, with assistance
from the FLSC, has developed emergency management operating plans and procedures to
address a wide range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity, earthquakes,
fire at transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases, medical
emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency situations
occurring within the transit system.

●

Emergency preparedness exercises – A minimum of one emergency tabletop or field exercise is
planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of emergency plans and procedures.
These may include readiness of RTD personnel to perform under emergency conditions; effective
coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies; and coordination of regional
emergency exercises that are facilitated through use of Tera software or other means. All exercises
are followed by after-action analyses and reports to document lessons learned and actions needed
to improve RTD’s emergency operations capabilities.

●

Emergency response training – All frontline RTD transportation and maintenance personnel
will undergo emergency response training to ensure full understanding of their role and
responsibilities during an emergency incident. The level of training will be based on their
anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum, training is provided on the emergency plans
and procedures that the employee may be required to implement. Training to familiarize fire,
rescue, and other emergency service personnel with special transit system requirements is
coordinated through the FLSC and Safety and Transit Security Division staff, with assistance from
the Bus and Rail Divisions, as appropriate.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The second element PTASP is Risk Management, describing how RTD identifies, evaluates, tracks, and
mitigates hazards and risk in the agency and on the transit system. Tolerable risk levels, performance
targets, and mitigation measures are established.

2.1 Risk Management Program
2.1.1

Risk Management

Effective risk management helps RTD serve its customers, employees, and the district by ensuring that the
agency provides excellence in:
●

Community Value

●

Customer Excellence

●

Employee Ownership

●

Financial Success

Executive Leadership is committed to:
●

Understanding risk in the context of the frequency (likelihood) and severity (consequence) of
events that can or do happen, in order to guide agency actions that support delivery on the
agency’s objectives within fiscal, ethical, regulatory, and other practical constraints

●

Transparency regarding the tradeoffs between risks, costs, and performance inherent in all decisions

●

Using clearly defined agency strategies, objectives, operational plans, and processes in the
identification, evaluation, mitigation, and acceptance of risk

●

Optimizing limited resources to meet objectives

Localized Hazard Management

Chiefs/AGMs play a key role in the hazard management process and ensure that the process has been fully
integrated within their departments. Chiefs/AGMs also ensure that the following elements of the hazard
management process are present in their departments:
●

Ensure employees have the ability to report hazards to management in person or through the use
of the electronic hazard reporting form via the intranet

●

Ensure hazards are placed on a local hazard log for tracking and documentation

●

Represent management, or select designee to represent management, on a local/site committee

●

Ensure each hazard has been assigned to a specific individual/point of contact

●

1.B.4.a

Local Hazard Logs

Local site senior managers, managers, and supervisors, along with Transit Safety Specialists (TSSs),
ensures that local hazard logs are used to track hazards at the departmental level within RTD. These
logs are to be maintained within the department and are reviewed by the local safety committee on a
monthly basis. Hazards placed on the local log receive their initial and final hazard ratings using the Risk
Assessment Matrix. These individuals may give hazards their initial rating when hazards are received
and final ratings when they are closed. This same group may also present hazards to the local safety
committee for hazard ratings or employ the Safety Division for assistance in rating hazards. Hazard ratings
may be changed with new information or as a result of data analysis.

2.1.1.3

Hazard Management

When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the local
safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated to the corresponding Safety Division
Hazard Logs and be reviewed by the System Safety Working Group (SSWG). The SSWG represents key
department managers that have the ability to make decisions and will employ multiple disciplines at RTD
and have access to higher level budgeted solutions.

2.1.1.4

Safety Division Hazard Logs

TSSs are responsible for the maintenance of Safety Division hazard logs. They ensure that hazards
meeting defined criteria are entered into the appropriate category within the hazard reporting system for
accurate record keeping. Hazard rating should be developed with input from the Safety Division, local site
senior managers, managers, and supervisors. The following are specific hazards that are identified and
mitigated at the agency level:
●

Unacceptable hazards (high hazards)

●

Hazards identified from reviews from outside agencies (CPUC, FTA, FRA, OSHA)

●

Hazards identified from accident investigations

●

Hazards where corrective action will cost more than an estimate of $25,000

●

Serious or high hazards on local department hazard log over 45 days

●

When warranted by the Safety Division

2.1.1.5

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

CAPs are used within RTD for hazards that meet certain criteria. The following hazards require the usage of
a corrective action plan:
●

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (high hazards)

●

Findings from regulatory agencies resulting in non-conformance (CPUC, FTA, FRA, OSHA)

●

Corrective action resulting from accident investigations

●

When warranted by the Safety Division

2.1.1.2

1.B.4.a

●

Unacceptable hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (high hazards)

●

Findings from regulatory agencies resulting in non-conformance (CPUC, FTA)

●

Accident investigations requiring corrective action

●

Testing or reviews of industrial hygiene that potentially exceed Permissible Exposure Limits

For hazards that do not meet the Unacceptable Risk Assessment Codes of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, or 1C (High
Hazards), SSOA staff will review and preliminarily approve the CAP before safety risk mitigation activities
are implemented.
If an emergency corrective action must be taken immediately to ensure safety, the SSOA must be notified
of the issue immediately, and RTD must follow up with the SSOA for subsequent review and approval of the
corrective action within five business days.
The SSOA will review and provide final approval of all CAPs on a quarterly basis.
CAPs are assigned a specific tracking number by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and are linked
with their associated hazard. CAPs must contain at a minimum:
●

A person of responsibility for the corrective action

●

A proposed completion date

●

Plan approval when applicable

2.1.1.6

Corrective Action Plan/Preventative Action Plan Development

CAPs are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the Safety Division. TSSs will
ensure that the CAP process is followed and properly tracked until it is closed.

2.1.2

Hazard Process Overview

RTD’s hazard process includes all facilities, light rail, and bus systems. The hazard management flowchart
lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated, analyzed, controlled or eliminated,
tracked, and reported to RTD leadership and CPUC State Safety Oversight.
●

TSSs assigned to light rail, bus, and capital projects are the primary points of contact for the hazard
management process

●

Safety committee members for rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and analyze hazards

●

The TSSs will enter identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system

●

The TSS and/or committee will develop a CAP for each unacceptable and undesirable hazard
entry, identify a point of contact or owner of the hazard, and place this information within the
hazard reporting system for tracking purposes

●

CAPs may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation

●

Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of the hazard

21

Packet Pg. 42

Attachment: RTD_PTASP_2022_Final (4596 : 2022 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

In the following instances, CAPs must receive prior approval by the State Safety Oversight Agency (SSOA)
before corrective action plans may be carried out:

●

Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is identified as
having a mitigation that involves multiple departments or requires cost or changes beyond the
safety committee or department abilities or budgets, the hazard are elevated to the SSWG. The
SSWG will represent key department managers, have the capability to employ multiple disciplines,
and have access to higher level budgeted solutions.

●

Recommendations/results from contractor or internal review, testing, or industrial or environmental
sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the hazard log for follow up and
possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or Environmental requirements. If mitigation
or control of a hazard is not achieved through the SSWG, the hazard mitigation process may be
elevated to the CSO and/or the GM/CEO.

2.1.2.1

Hazard Identification

Identifying hazards is the responsibility of all employees and contractors. The continuous identification,
monitoring, and elimination of hazards is key to an effective safety program.
Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to, the following:
●

Observation, inspection, and interaction with all employees and contractors

●

Review of reports from safety committee members, customers, and customer service and field personnel

●

Evaluation of accidents, incidents, and near misses, to include data trends and projections

●

Conducting Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction

●

Conducting safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system
modification, configuration management verification, and inspection processes

●

Conducting Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations

●

Review of internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews

●

Review of controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback

●

“Lesson learned” inputs

●

Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards

●

Review of NTSB, FRA, FTA, OSHA, safety recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts

●

Review of Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports

●

Review of data and information provided by the SSOA

The Hazard Management Flow Chart (in the attached document as Exhibit E.6) will be followed by
employees in identifying and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level. Actions will be taken to
move the hazard to the safety committee and beyond if necessary.

2.1.3

Hazard Investigation, Evaluation, and Analysis

RTD is currently in the process of developing and refining a database where incidents and observed
hazards can be tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This will allow
management to be proactive in correcting hazards.

1.B.4.a

Safety concerns are identified and corrected at the lowest level (employee/department) as soon as
practicable. Safety concerns that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a supervisor or a TSS.
Reported concerns will be assessed by a TSS and/or safety committee to determine if a safety hazard
exists and assign an initial hazard rating.

2.1.3.1

Root Cause Analysis and Accident Evaluation

Hazards are investigated following the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation policy and
procedure. Hazards originating from accidents are reviewed by TSSs, Managers and Supervisors, and
respective safety committees. A third-party expert may assist with an investigation if deemed necessary.
The level of investigation and the methodology used will be determined based upon risk assessments.
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis made by
management, a safety committee, or a TSS receive immediate attention/control. A high hazard rating
requires corrective action.
Hazards that receive a high hazard rating will be elevated from the local hazard log to the electronic hazard
reporting system.
SERIOUS hazards (1D, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and decisions by
management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will remain on the local hazard logs no more
than 45 days before being moved to the appropriate Safety Division log.
MEDIUM (1E, 2D, 2E, 3C, 3D, 3E, 4A, 4B) hazards may be acceptable with review by management. Events
from a medium hazard are less likely to occur and are less severe in nature.
LOW (4C, 4D, 4E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.
ELIMINATED hazards are no longer present.

2.1.3.2 Hazard Reporting Threshold to Colorado Public Utilities Commission
RTD will notify CPUC of all identified hazards in the light rail system via the electronic reporting system and
monthly/quarterly reporting. RTD will notify CPUC in a timely manner of all hazardous conditions that affect
the immediate safety of the light rail system. At a minimum, RTD notifies CPUC within one business day,
according to the notification procedures in the CPUC standard, of hazardous conditions that are rated as
High and set forth in the transit agency’s Hazard Identification/Resolution Matrix:
●

1A (Catastrophic/Frequent)

●

2A (Critical/Frequent)

●

1B (Catastrophic/Probable)

●

2B (Critical/Probable)

2.1.3.3 Hazard Assessment Matrix
Hazard severity is a subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel error,
environmental conditions, design inadequacies, and/or procedural efficiencies for system, subsystem, or
component failure or malfunction.

2.1.3.4 Hazard Severity
Hazard severity is a subjective determination of the worst case that could be anticipated to result from
human error, design inadequacies, component failure, or malfunction. The categories of hazards based
on the modified Department of Defense Standard Practice System Safety MIL-STD-882E Risk Assessment
Matrix are as follows:

24

Packet Pg. 45

Attachment: RTD_PTASP_2022_Final (4596 : 2022 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

RTD will include in its hazard log and hazard management process hazardous conditions, incidents,
occurrences, and events, including the following:

Category 1 Catastrophic — Operating conditions are such that human error; design deficiencies; element,
subsystem or component failure; or procedural deficiencies may cause death or major system loss and
require immediate termination of the unsafe activity or operation.
Category 2 Critical — Operating conditions are such that human error, subsystem or component failure, or
procedural deficiencies may cause severe injury, severe occupational illness, or major system damage and
require immediate corrective action.
Category 3 Marginal — Operating conditions are such that they may result in minor injury, occupational
illness, or system damage, and are such that human error or subsystem or component failures can be
counteracted or controlled.
Category 4 Negligible — Operating conditions are such that human error, subsystem or component failure,
or procedural deficiencies will result in less than minor injury, occupational illness, or system damage.
The categorization of hazards is consistent with risk-based criteria for severity. It reflects the principle that
not all hazards pose an equal amount of risk to personal safety.

2.1.3.5 Hazard Probability
The probability of a particular event or a specific hazard occurring may be defined as the number of times
that a specific event occurs compared with the total number of trials in which this event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. Generally, hazard probability is described qualitatively in potential
occurrences per units of time, miles, trips/runs, or customers carried. A hazard probability may be derived
from the analysis of transit system operating experience, evaluation of safety data, the analysis of reliability
and failure data, or historical safety data from other passenger rail systems or bus systems.

2.1.3.6 Hazard or Risk Assessments
RTD has adopted a system for assessing the level of risk for each identified hazard to determine what
action(s) must be taken to correct or document the hazard risk. This assessment system has been
incorporated into the formal system safety analysis, which enables the TSS or safety committees as
decision-makers to understand the amount of risk involved in accepting the hazard in relation to the cost
(e.g., schedule, cost, operations) to reduce the hazard to an acceptable level.
The following Hazard Matrix identifies the hazard risk index (HRI) based upon hazard category and
probability and the criteria for defining further actions based upon the index.

2.1.4

Hazard Control, Elimination, and Tracking

Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or eliminated so that the hazard
does not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner as long as the hazard is
controlled. The process of controlling, tracking, and eliminating hazards is recorded on the hazard log,
which is generated from the electronic hazard reporting system. The portions of the hazard log applicable
to the light rail system are discussed with the CPUC on a monthly basis.
Depending upon the risk ranking, hazard log entries may require a mitigation plan or CAP, tracking number,
brief description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard/risk rating (IHR/IRR) using the Hazard
Assessment Matrix.
●

CAPs include the following information:

●

Element of activity identified as deficient

●

Planned activities to resolve deficiency

●

Department responsible for implementing corrective action

●

Scheduled completion date for implementation

Hazard log entries with their associated CAP are reviewed regularly by the Safety Division, safety
committees, and CPUC-SSO. They are periodically reviewed by senior management. CAPs may be tracked
and sorted from the hazard log. When a CAP is closed, the hazard log will reflect this action and a
closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored by hazard tracking number.

Hazard Resolution and Elimination

Hazard resolution is defined as the analysis and subsequent actions taken to reduce the risk associated
with an identified hazard to the lowest level practicable. Hazard resolution is not synonymous with hazard
elimination. In a transit environment, some hazards are impossible to eliminate, and others are highly
impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk to the lowest practical level can be accomplished in a variety of
ways, from protective and warning devices to special procedures. The hierarchy of controls will be followed
to achieve a tolerable risk level, as described below.
1.

Design out or design to minimize hazard severity. To the extent permitted by cost and practicality,
identified hazards will be eliminated or controlled by the design of equipment, systems, and
facilities.

2. Hazards that cannot reasonably be eliminated or controlled through design will be controlled
to the extent practicable to an acceptable level through the use of fixed, automatic, or other
protective safety design features or devices. Provisions will be made for periodic functional checks
of safety devices and training for employees to ensure that system safety objectives are met.
3.

When design and safety devices can neither reasonably nor effectively eliminate or control an
identified hazard, safety warning devices will be used to the extent practicable to alert persons to
the hazards

4.

Where it is impossible to reasonably eliminate or adequately control a hazard through design or
the use of safety warning devices, procedures and training will be used to control the hazard

2.1.5

Hazard Tracking

Each CAP developed for hazards or findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted to CPUC
for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a tracking number and placed on the
hazard log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the corrective action, the Safety Division will
submit to CPUC as required. The completed CAP is formally adopted by receiving CPUC-SSO’s signature.
The hazard log will then be updated to show the status of the identified hazard with its CAP to “CLOSED.”
RTD will monitor all CAPs with the use of the Hazard Log and will provide CPUC with an updated hazard
log quarterly.
Internally, the Safety Division will coordinate with the appropriate department to develop a mitigation plan
and fill out the appropriate form for the identified hazard. The form will be assigned a tracking number by
the electronic hazard reporting system and placed on the hazard log with the corresponding hazards for
tracking purposes.

2.1.6

Ongoing Reporting To State Safety Oversight Agency

A TSS will review the current status and identify any issues with the resolution action and dates. The
portions of the hazard log applicable to the light rail system, at a minimum, is provided to the SSOA monthly.

Attachment: RTD_PTASP_2022_Final (4596 : 2022 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2.1.4.1

All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked and
reported to CPUC with a determination of an unacceptable hazardous condition, along with the CAPs for
each unacceptable hazardous condition found.
The CPUC notifies RTD in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the CAP and in accordance with
procedures specified in the CPUC-SSO standard. The CAP form requires a CPUC-SSO electronic or wet
signature approval, indicating the assigned resolution and completion of the CAP. The CAP is maintained
in the Laserfiche hazard reporting system files and is identified by a specific hazard log identifier tracking
number. After a hazard has been resolved, it will be assigned its final hazard rating.

2.1.7

Pre-Job Safety Briefings

Employees who perform infrequent tasks (less than once every three months) or high risk job tasks
(working at heights, energy isolation, confined space, hoisting and rigging, etc.) are required to discuss job
tasks and identified hazards that are associated with those tasks or job steps during pre-job briefings.

2.2 Hazardous Materials Program
Environmental Management

An environmental management process is in place at RTD to ensure that all materials ordered have
Safety Data Sheet (SDS) forms shipped with the materials or prior to shipment. If these types of materials
are ordered, they are not received until the SDS is provided. SDS forms are forwarded to the TSSs and/
or Transit Environmental Specialists who place the forms in the appropriate SDS database in facilities or
electronic system.
Each employee who works with hazardous materials receives training on hazardous materials
management, including their responsibilities and right to know about potential hazards with which they work.

2.2.2

Management of Hazardous Materials

For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, RTD facilities must maintain and submit an
SDS (or a list of the chemicals) to their State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency
Planning Committee (LEPC), and local fire department. RTD facilities also must report an annual inventory
of these chemicals by March 1 of each year to their SERC, LEPC, and local fire department. The Safety
Division has been given this reporting responsibility. The information is made available to the public.
Over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and 600 extremely hazardous chemicals are subject to reporting.
Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity. RTD submits an annual Tier II chemical inventory
report for facilities that are subject to reporting.
The common hazardous materials used by RTD that are subject to reporting are:
●

Diesel fuel

●

Gasoline

●

New and used oil

●

Antifreeze (ethylene glycol)

●

Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)

The liquids are stored in tanks or drums within secondary containment. RTD also uses many hazardous
chemicals contained in soaps, solvents, brake cleaners, paints, and aerosols. These hazardous materials
are described in the product-specific SDS.
RTD is also a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. Hazardous wastes can be generated by:
●

Discarding a hazardous material (e.g., oil-based paint, pesticides, some soaps, expired products)

●

Using a product (e.g., used batteries, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, paint thinner, aerosol dregs)

Hazardous wastes are stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas.
These containers are labeled hazardous waste and located near where the waste is generated. The
Environmental Transit Specialists are responsible for preparing appropriate manifests, scheduling
hazardous materials transportation, and managing final disposal.

ASSURANCE

The third element of the PTASP is Safety Assurance, which describes how RTD will measure and review
its processes to ensure it remains in compliance with established standards. These processes, safety
performance targets, and reports provide assurance to RTD leadership that the organization and system
are functioning at an acceptable level of safety. The reviews, inspections, rules checks, and compliance
verification procedures are described, required schedules set, and acceptable measures established.

3.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews (ISR) and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews are conducted semiannually to assure compliance with the
SMS and that the plan is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety
issues and local fire codes. Written reports of each review are prepared and distributed once the ISR is
completed. Senior leaders will discuss safety reviews, evaluate the effectiveness of the SMS, recommend
corrective action if necessary, and ensure timely implementation and follow up. An internal light rail audit
review report is compiled in January and submitted to the CPUC by February 15 annually. The report
documents the review findings for the year, including the results of internal reviews performed during
the previous year; a summary of required corrective actions taken, if any; and provision for follow up to
ensure timely implementation and to determine effectiveness of the SMS. The annual audit report will be
accompanied by a formal letter of certification signed by the GM/CEO indicating that RTD is in compliance
with its SMS. If RTD identifies areas of deficiency, the GM/CEO will identify the activities RTD will take to
achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are maintained.
As part of the ISR program, all departments are subject to review. The Senior Manager of Safety is
responsible for and has complete authority to conduct IRSs. Two reviews are conducted each year, one
in the summer and one in the winter. Within a three-year period, all PTASP elements are reviewed for
compliance with the plan and SSO requirements. The sixth review cycle, which is the last quarter of the
third year, is reserved to review and revise the audit process to assure that all elements are completed and
that the program meets SSO requirements.
RTD will notify the CPUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the safety review.
An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review. At the opening
conference, checklists are distributed, discussed, and reviewed for accuracy, and a schedule is set.
The actual ISR consists of interviews with key personnel, documentation review, and observation of
activities to assess compliance and understanding of rules, training, and procedures. After completion
of the onsite activities, the checklists are completed, and a written draft report is developed. The draft
report may include recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to
make improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules, or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment to
the affected parties. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties. Recorded findings require
the development of a CAP. The annual ISR report prepared and submitted to the CPUC will include an
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the SMS.
Recommendations from previous review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles.
Findings will be tracked under the CAP process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet, and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports will be filed with the CPUC.
RTD has 30 days to respond to the draft report, including an opportunity to correct any findings.

Inspections, Field/Co-op Audits, and Reviews

The Safety Division conducts periodic inspections, field audits/co-op walk-throughs, and safety reviews.
Maintenance facilities are inspected monthly to ensure compliance with occupational safety regulations
and local fire codes. Any deviations from required activities or identified safety hazards are resolved
through a formal reporting process.

3.1.2

Accident Investigation, Notification, Reporting, and Corrective Action Plans

Formal investigations shall be conducted for all reportable events. All accidents are investigated according
to the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation policy and procedure.
Serious bus accidents are similarly investigated by the accident investigation team consisting of the
following members: Street Supervisors, General Superintendent of Street Operations or Assistant
Superintendent of Street Operations, Risk Management representative, Division Manager, Manager of Bus
Operations, Transportation Manager of the Bus Operations, TSS, Bus Operations, and Technical Services
representative.
All reportable transit events, as defined in 4 CCR 723-7-7348, will be tracked and evaluated by the CSO
and the affected Chief/AGM. The Safety Division will oversee event investigation activities with the CPUC
and will provide as much advance notice as practicable to notify the CPUC of an accident investigation.
When investigating an accident as defined in 4 CCR 723-7-7347, RTD will give prior sufficient telephone
or email notice to CPUC staff of the times that an accident investigation team will convene to conduct
interviews, inspections, examinations, or tests to determine the cause of the accident.
Light rail control will notify the Safety Division of every accident that meets the criteria listed below. Upon
notification, the Safety Division will determine the level of investigation to be performed by the Safety
Unit. Light rail accidents and incidents are investigated according to Standard Operating Procedure 103.2
– Incident/Accident Investigation and the Policy and Procedure for Event Notification, Reporting, and
Investigation.
Notification is required within two hours pursuant to 4 CCR 723-7-7348(a) for any accident occurring on a
Rail Fixed Guideway Public Transportation System (RFGPTS) where one or more of the following occurs:
●

Fatality at the scene, or confirmation of death within 30 days of accident

●

Serious injuries as defined in 4 CCR 723-7-7341(tt), requiring immediate medical attention away
from the scene for one or more individuals

●

Property damage resulting from a collision involving a rail vehicle

●

An evacuation due to life safety reasons

●

A collision at a grade crossing

●

A derailment of a rail vehicle

●

A runaway train

●

A collision between a rail vehicle and a second rail vehicle, or a rail non-revenue vehicle

Accident notification under 4 CCR 723-7-7347(b) is not required by RTD, as the agency has no light rail
track that is shared with the general railroad system.

3.1.3

Collect, Analyze, and Report Safety Management System Data, and
Maintain Records

SMS data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information, accident investigation
reports, ISRs, safety committee meetings, occupational injury reports, incident reports, use of an accident
matrix, system monitoring including testing and inspection records, and the hazard management program.
This safety data will be analyzed and used for development of Key Safety Performance Indicators and
Targets. RTD reports the following to National Transit Database (NTD):
●

Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Safety events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

System reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode

These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four measures
and for each mode of transit, in order to encourage improvements and monitor the safety performance
of delivering transit services. In addition, RTD selects additional performance measures and targets, both
leading and lagging, to ensure continual improvement of the SMS. RTD communicates safety performance
information throughout the agency using various methods of communication, including electronic message
boards, committee meetings, newsletters, and team/crew meetings to keep employees informed of SMS
initiatives, risks and performance.
RTD will make its safety performance measures improvement targets available to applicable state agencies
(e.g., CDOT) and metropolitan planning organizations (currently DRCOG) together, “external entities”; and,
to the maximum extent practicable, will coordinate with the external entities in the selection of external
entity safety performance targets.

The safety data collected will be analyzed for potential safety impacts. Identified areas of concern are
reported to appropriate personnel in the form of specific project reports and memos. Records of system
safety data are maintained in the office of the Safety Division for a minimum of three years. Certain
information, such as safety certification backup documentation, is maintained by RTD’s document control
process managed by the Capital Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety Division maintains
data and documentation of activities required by the SMS.

3.1.4

System Modifications or Major Repairs

New fixed facility equipment modifications and retrofits are reviewed and approved by the RTD
engineering group and the technical support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD Infrastructure
Change Review Committee. Non-infrastructure changes will follow the non-infrastructure change process.

3.1.5

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modifications Hazard Resolution

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are included in the risk management program
process as described in section 3. This process is facilitated by the Safety Division and performed jointly
by the Capital Programs, Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety divisions. New equipment, system
expansions, and modifications are ultimately reviewed, approved, and documented.

3.1.5.1

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the Capital
Programs Department and Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety divisions. This review is conducted
to assure that new equipment, expansions, and modifications safely and operationally integrate into the
existing system.

3.1.5.2 New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Acceptance
Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Bus Operations and Rail Operations divisions
perform rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the vehicle and equipment acceptance
process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the Bus Operations and
Rail Operations divisions. This information is presented and approved by the Safety Certification Program
and described in section 3. The Safety and Security Certification Program provides an identification,
design, review, and verification process for system expansions and modifications. Certification process
completion is verified by sign-off from the CSO.

3.1.5.3 Exceptions to Established Design Criteria
Level 4 and above exceptions to design criteria are approved only by the acceptance of the CSO and the
GM/CEO. If appropriate, the design criteria may be amended or modified to accommodate acceptable
modifications. The AGM of Capital Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the
design criteria.

1.B.4.a

Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by the Procurement Standards Manual. Each
procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the requesting manager.
Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the scope of the procurement.
As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review. Minor procurements require
authorization from the Materials Management Division and the Division Manager of the requesting
division. Major procurements, such as light rail- or bus construction-related projects or procurement of
buses or light rail vehicles, are subject to the following review process. The Capital Programs Division and
technical support staff develop detailed specifications through the design process. These specifications
are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of design, peer reviews by personnel from other
transit agencies, and ultimate approval by the GM/CEO. In addition to procurement specifications, the
safety and security certification review process described in Section 3 governs light rail construction.
This procurement procedure, in combination with the system modification procedure, established design
criteria, and hazard communication program, precludes the introduction of unauthorized hazardous
materials and supplies as well as defective or deficient equipment into the agency’s transit systems.

3.1.5.4 Procurement Procedures

1.B.4.a

Management of Change (MOC)/Configuration Control of Infrastructure within RTD will be managed through
the Infrastructure Change Review (ICR) process during design and construction. The ICR process is
managed by the Capital Programs Department. The MOC process is managed by the CSO and the Chief
Engineer. MOC/Configuration Management within RTD consists of the ICR process during design and
construction, and the MOC process during operations.
The ICR process coordinates new systems or extensions before they are implemented in the existing
operating environment. Project Managers use the Project Management Plan (PMP) to guide capital projects.
In addition to the PMP, the Project Control Specialist will implement guidance from the Project Control
User Manual. This manual is updated periodically and contains direction for as-built and document control
procedures. Specific guidance for document control procedures, file creation (4.2), and file codes is provided
in Section 4.0 of the manual. Smaller projects may include an abbreviated PMP specific to the project.
Representatives from each involved department and safety are represented in the ICR process. When
changes are made to existing structures or facilities, it is critical that affected personnel, the public, or other
groups be notified of changes that might have potential safety or security impacts. Affected personnel are
invited to participate in project meetings and coordinate any changes. Additional training may be required.
Operations and maintenance procedures, bulletins, or SOPs may need to be developed. Communications
Department personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or affected groups. An essential
element of communications must take place after the project is completed. Any observed negative or
hazardous impacts of change must be reported to the Chief Engineer, or CSO, as soon as possible.

3.2.1

Safety and Security Certification

System safety personnel develop and implement safety and security certification programs to assure that
safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to the initiation of rail passenger operations
for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, or modification or replacement of equipment. RTD uses
the FTA Handbook for Transit Safety and Security Certification to develop the requirements for each safety
and security certification program. An individual safety and security certification plan is developed for
each new corridor. For minor extensions or projects, safety and security certification is addressed through
the preparation of safety and security certification forms applicable to the scope of work. Modifications
are managed through the light rail change/modification process. If equipment is procured as part of a
new maintenance facility, it is included in the certification program for the facility. Rail vehicles undergo a
formalized acceptance program under the supervision of Rail Operations.
The safety and security certification program has the following goals:
●

Verify that acceptable safety and security levels are met or exceeded

●

Document the verification of safety and security standards

●

Provide consistency for project certification

With these goals in mind, the objectives of the program can be more narrowly defined. The program
objectives are to identify and verify:
●

Safety and security requirements of the system design

●

Safety and security requirements for construction and system equipment installation

●

That safety and security requirements are met or exceeded for system testing

●

That safety and security requirements are met for changes or modifications to standard operating
procedures, training manuals, rule book, and system elements

The CSO and the Manager of Safety are responsible for the management of the program.

1.B.4.a

Quality Assurance

Capital projects have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the design and
construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In general, QA/QC
activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to review by the FTA and
others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the contractor and submitted in the
quality plan prior to initiation of construction. RTD retains qualified inspectors and testing firms to provide
quality assurance by document submittal reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout the project.
Received goods are required to be compared to items ordered, lot numbering, or other certifications
as required on safety critical items. Where applicable, receiving personnel assure that lot number
documentation is provided before materials are received or accepted. Periodically, purchasing personnel
or TSSs will randomly sample hardware, slings, lifting devices, and other devices for compliance with
specifications. Items will also be functionally tested periodically to assure they meet standards.

3.3 Rules Compliance
Reports and Data Analysis

The results of the operational tests are compiled and reviewed quarterly by the Manager of Rail Operations
or a designated supervisor(s) and the Safety Manager. A written form of the discussion and review will be
provided to the Safety Division within 30 days after the end of the quarter. An annual report is completed
by a designated supervisor(s) summarizing the previous year’s results of the operational tests. The annual
report is turned over to the Safety Division for further review and trend analysis.

3.3.1.1

Enforcement Violations

Rule violations are addressed through the agency’s management process, which includes coaching,
retraining, and formal discipline that may result in termination. Additionally, all accidents and incidents are
reviewed by supervisors and the Safety Division to determine if rules have been violated, or if revisions,
changes, or additions are necessary to the SMS and the PTASP.

3.3.1.2 Risk Management
A TSS may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or procedure into the risk management
program for resolution. Risks unresolved by the RSC or the BSC are directed to the SSWG for further
tracking, review, resolution, and/or correction. Noncompliant review findings determined to be hazardous
are documented in the hazard log. A date of observation, description of the hazardous condition, corrective
action required, and implementation date are tracked until the hazardous condition is corrected. (See the
Risk Management Program portion of the PTASP for further information.) The Safety Division conducts
ongoing and regular observations and reviews to determine the effectiveness of the rule compliance
program.

3.3.2

SMS Policies, Procedures, and Processes

RTD has adopted policies, procedures, processes, training materials and employee rule books to establish
requirements and expectations for safe operations, maintenance, and construction for the agency. These
are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary according to the following guidelines: prior to revenue
service of a system expansion, new bus route, or new corridor; or as recommended by the ISR process. A
committee consisting of Controller/Supervisors, Operators, and TSSs performs review. Recommended SOP
changes are reviewed and approved by the Chief/AGM of the affected division/department.

Techniques, Schedules, and Procedures

Preventative maintenance (PM) inspection schedules are generated through the computer system per
equipment manufacturer guidelines and recommendations, and as required by local, state, and federal
regulations. A Maintenance Supervisor identifies upcoming PM inspections and assigns the work to their
crew for completion. Inspectors use checklists to identify potential physical hazards, unsafe equipment,
unsafe acts, and policy and procedural deficiencies with the facility or equipment being inspected.
Completed inspection reports and checklists are returned to the supervisor for review. Each department is
responsible for maintaining inspection and repair records to confirm the inspection process.

3.4.2.1 MOW (Line, Signal, and Rail Maintenance) Standards and Procedures
Line and Signal Technicians use a Maintenance of Way plan, “MOW Procedures,” that outlines specific
testing and maintenance procedures modeled after FRA regulations. These are in accordance with 49 CFR
Parts 233-236.
Right-of-way rail maintenance uses a maintenance plan, “Rail Maintenance Standards,” to maintain the
track in accordance with FRA regulations 49 CFR Part 213. The standard outlines all aspects of proper
maintenance and inspections regarding track.

3.5 Inspections and Reviews
Maintenance

Maintenance and service of all vehicles, equipment, and facilities is established using manufacturer
manuals, codes, standards, and established procedures as guidelines. Maintenance is performed at a
level of readiness that ensures safe, efficient, and reliable service. RTD maintains data to track scheduled
maintenance of vehicles and equipment.
Safety critical equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service. Vehicles
or equipment that are involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason to suspect that
equipment failure contributed to the cause of the accident. Vehicles or equipment are returned to service
only after it is determined that no defects could have contributed to the accident. RTD has established
procedures to ensure rapid deployment, recovery, and return to service in the event of an emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient operations. The Bus and Light
Rail divisions have standards that make safety and reliability the primary objectives of the system. These
goals are met by the incorporation of preventive and repair maintenance programs for all aspects of the
system. The Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance Strategic Plan addresses the following principles:
●

Preventive maintenance programs will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures

●

Changes in preventive maintenance programs may be expected periodically as experience is
gained on the equipment maintained

●

Preventive maintenance goals and polices will not be altered due to time constraints or as a costreduction measure in times of financial stress

●

Effective maintenance procedures require much record-keeping and information storage/retrieval

●

The technical sophistication of the LRV, and the tracking of a large, expensive inventory, place a
heavy responsibility on the information capabilities of the light rail vehicle maintenance department

The Bus Fleet Maintenance Plan addresses the following areas:
●

Maintenance division goals and objectives

●

Contingency bus fleet

●

Maintenance management system

●

Preventative maintenance program

●

Wheelchair lift preventative maintenance program

●

Quality control program

●

New bus inspection procedure

●

Maintenance bulletins

●

3.6 Drug and Alcohol Program
Drug and Alcohol Program

RTD maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with U.S. Department of
Transportation and FTA regulations. The program includes criteria for random testing of safety sensitive
personnel and testing for cause, either accident related or from observed behavior. The Administration
Department manages this program, which is subject to frequent review by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in RTD’s Drug and
Alcohol Policy. Training on this policy is required for each new hire and provided during orientation. The
program is administered by the Drug and Alcohol Program Manager, who verifies compliance with the
program and oversees training. Revisions to the program are distributed to all employees. If necessary,
follow-up training is provided.
Compliance with and knowledge of the program are accomplished through direct supervision of
employees and refresher training if necessary.
GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
RTD is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and economical transportation services to the public, and
to providing a healthy, safe, and satisfying work environment for employees. RTD and the Amalgamated
Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 agree that employees must be able to work in a drug- and alcohol-free
work environment. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect the rights and respect the
privacy of all employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees, customers, and
the public from the adverse effects of drug and alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to restrict
employees’ off-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol abuse
and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and drug testing
results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an effective employee
assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work not under the influence of alcohol or controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees’ rights and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implemented this policy to:
●

Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing

●

Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems

●

Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through education, training, and discipline

●

Enforce RTD’s goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate discipline

Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only of
the abuser, but also the abuser’s family, friends, and the public at large. Employees should be aware of
the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of intervening when a
substance abuse problem is suspected.
This policy was originally adopted by the Board of Directors on Oct. 18, 1994, with subsequent
modifications adopted in September 1998, July 2000, May 2003, July 2011, and March 2013. Many
elements of this policy are required by federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive job
classifications. Other elements of this policy are not required by federal regulations but are official policy.

3.6.1

1.B.4.a

This policy supersedes all other drug, alcohol, or substance abuse policies. To the extent that any
elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may be amended or revised
in the future, the regulations shall take precedence. Employees are expected to review, be familiar with,
and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and testing. All existing and new
employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and consequences of prohibited
drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment, and the signs and symptoms that may
indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in RTD’s drug and alcohol testing program, is a required
condition of employment.

3.6.2

Applicability

3.6.2.1 Categories of Employees
This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees, volunteers, and contractors
and are referred to in this policy as “employees” unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all
employees while on RTD property to perform duty or while performing any work-related business. Visitors
and vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on RTD property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform “safety sensitive
functions” for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Part 40 as amended and Part
655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other special requirements set forth in this
policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to perform, or
immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of public transportation.
The following are safety-sensitive functions:
●

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in revenue service

●

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle

●

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service

●

Operating a non-revenue-service vehicle when required to be operated by a holder of a
Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)

●

Carrying a firearm for security purposes

●

Supervising any function listed in the items above

RTD reviews the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to determine which
employees perform safety-sensitive functions and determines which job functions may require the
performance of safety-sensitive duties. An analysis will be performed if any new job classifications are
developed, or current job description changes, to determine if the job should be considered safetysensitive by querying the policy.

is managed by the Chief Engineer and the CSO. MOC management within RTD consists of the ICR process
during design and construction, and the MOC process during operations.
MOC process applies to existing bus and rail services systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment that may
not require formal safety certification, but which may have safety impacts.

4.1.2.2 Bus Safety Committee (BSC)
The BSC coordinates ongoing safety efforts within the transportation, facilities, and maintenance functions
the Bus Operations Division. The committee meets monthly to update and mitigate hazards within their
facilities and on their systems. Committees are formed for the District Shops, Platte, East Metro, and
Boulder divisions. The BSCs are chaired by the Safety Division’s delegate, usually a TSS. The committees
consist of up to any manager within the division, and an employee(s) from the following areas: Street
Operations, Bus Operations, Bus Maintenance, Facilities Maintenance (to include Service and Cleaning),
Health and Wellness, Transit Security, and any other unique area (e.g., Treasury). The ATU 1001 appoints
bargaining unit employees to the BSC as needed to serve as safety representatives from the ranks of
each department.

Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the BSC, through
an open communication process. Minutes are maintained and distributed to the members of the BSC and
the transportation managers, posted to the local safety board in the division, and made available to others.
The BSC minutes contains an open item log listing issues brought forward at BSC meetings, submitted
through the Hazard Management System, and placed in the safety suggestion boxes posted at each
division. The log will include the month/year the item was brought forward to the committee, an initial
hazard rating (Risk Assessment Code), and the estimated month/year the corrective action will be
completed. There also is a log of closed/completed items, as well as informational items for employees.
This log is posted at each division for all employees to view. Most safety issues are resolved within the
parameters of the BSC. Issues not resolved in the BSC, or safety critical hazards, are referred to the SSWG.
BSC actions include the following:
●

Review facility and operations system safety issues identified by members, staff, reviews, or inspections

●

Assign responsibility for correcting hazards

●

Review open items for completion

●

Ensure safety and regulatory rule compliance (FTA, CPUC)

4.1.2.3 Rail Safety Committee (RSC)
The RSC coordinates ongoing safety efforts within the Operations and Maintenance funcitons of the light
rail system. They meet monthly to update and mitigate hazards in their facilities and on their systems.
A committee is formed for light rail consisting of the Operations Manager, two representatives (one
represented, one non-represented) from Operations, Light Rail Maintenance, Facility Maintenance,
Maintenance of Way, and the TSS-rail, the latter serving as a technical advisor and chair to the committee.
The corresponding maintenance facilities (Elati, Rio Court, and Mariposa) are represented respectively
on their RSC. The ATU appoints bargaining unit employees to the RSC annually to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department, voicing safety concerns to the RSC.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the RSC, through
an open communication process. Minutes of discussion and action are maintained and distributed to the
members of the RSC and are available to others.
The RSC maintains a local hazard log listing issues, corrective actions, and closeout dates. The hazard log
includes the date entered and the responsible party to correct the action. Most safety issues are resolved
within the parameters of the RSC. Issues not resolved in the RSC, or safety critical hazards, are referred to
the SSWG.
RSC actions are similar to those listed under the BSC above. Additionally, the RSC uses the General Code
of Operating Rules (GCOR), (FRA 49 CFR Part 214, 49 CFR Parts 200-399 as a model for; and examines for
compliance with FTA 49 CFR Parts 673, 674).

4.1.2.4 Fire and Life Safety Committee (FLSC) (Projects Only)
The FLSC serves as a liaison between project safety and local police, fire, and emergency response
agencies. The FLSC is chaired by the System Safety Engineer. Members include local police, fire, and EMS
staff, and supervisors within the Safety, Bus Operations, and Rail Operations divisions.

1.B.4.a

The FLSC coordinates inspections and drills to verify the fire and life safety and security emergency
response, and familiarization and compliance with the system. Drills are initiated during the activation
phase and continue during revenue operations, per federal requirement, to maintain an effective
interagency rapport.

4.1.2.5 System Safety Working Group (SSWG)
The SSWG comprises subject matter experts from all RTD departments who collaborate to review,
implement, and execute a system process required to complete a project or event that has been identified.
This group reviews systems or issues with the perspective of looking for hazards, identifying risk to:
●

Design or engineer problems out of the system

●

Correct through standard operating procedure

●

Mitigate with personal protective equipment

●

Eliminate the risk/hazard

The SSWG may not change the scope of the project but may make decisions that relate directly to the
remediation of specific hazards. To this end, it is best for the SSWG to be included in the scope phase of
the project plan.
The SSWG defines the job-specific Certified Items List (CILS) and creates and maintains the PHA. If the
SSWG determines that the residual risk of a hazard cannot be reduced below the Medium risk level, then
the SSWG presents its findings to the CSO for final risk analysis.

4.1.2.6 Investigation Team
This team comprises staff from various departments that have a role in the development of a CAP/
preventative action plan or mitigation plans resulting from RTD-involved events, occurrences, accidents,
and incidents. This process will follow the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and
Procedures.

4.1.2.7 Department Position Responsibilities
Specific departments and positions within RTD have inherent safety responsibilities. Those departments and
positions, illustrated in the safety organization chart, are addressed in the following matrix and sections:

4.2 Training and Certification Program
Employee Safety Training, Certification, Verification, and Performance Testing

Employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to their job
classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are Rail and
Bus Operators and Maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below. However, each training
and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training and written exams. Certification
documentation, including tests and test scores, is maintained in employee files and is subject to review
during the internal safety review program.
Except for the on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near RTD rail
property, RTD does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The on-track safety training
program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to work near or on RTD rail
property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format allowing contractors to train their
own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified through in-field observation and examination of
contractor training cards. The Safety Division maintains a log of all contractors trained under the program.
Regarding performance testing, any operating or maintenance rule is subject to verification and
compliance. Compliance with rules, training, and certification requirements is verified in several ways. Rail
and Bus Operators are frequently observed in the field by supervisors and Safety Division employees. A
supervisor must discuss an observed rule violation with the operator as soon as practicable. In addition
to ongoing monitoring and observation, Rail and Bus Operators are subject to formal ride checks in which
Supervisors, usually anonymously or covertly, observe Operators according to predetermined criteria
or a checklist. These ride checks are documented, reviewed with the Operator, and maintained in the
operator’s employee file. These records are subject to verification during the ISR process. Any trend or
issue discovered during system monitoring, observation, and ride checks is reported to the RTD divisional
leadership and the CSO for inclusion in the hazard management program.
Bus, Rail, and Facility Maintainers also receive direct supervision, including observation and verification
of their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is reviewed and
approved for correctness by his or her immediate Supervisor through the work order process. When a
Maintainer completes a work assignment, the direct Supervisor verifies and approves the work through
observation and signature approval on the work order. The Maintainer will enter in the system that the
work is complete, and the direct Supervisor will verify and approve the work, then accept that the work
was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also observed during the
ISR process. Supervision is also assessed during the ISR program by the review of documentation and
compliance with schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or findings in
the review report. Review findings are referred to the Senior Manager of Safety for inclusion in the hazard
management program.

4.2.2

Operator Certification

Light Rail Operators must complete a course based upon light rail standard operating procedures and rules
prior to certification. Written tests, alignment map tests, and practical examination are administered, and
operators must receive a minimum correct score of 80% to pass. A minimum of four weeks is spent in the
light rail vehicle in actual operation with a training instructor. Competency standards are established in the
“Regional Transportation District Light Rail Training Quality Manual” (see Exhibit XVI and section 4.3, Light
Rail Operator Training).

1.B.4.a

Operator Biennial Recertification

Recertification every two years is required of all Light Rail Operators and Controller/Supervisors.
Controller/Supervisors also complete this training as they are required to maintain their operator
certification. Recertification consists of the following: one-day review of SOPs, rules and alignment;
light rail vehicle ride check with operator; and a written test covering SOPs, rules, and alignment map.
Recertification requires a score of at least 80%. Competency standards are established in the “Regional
Transportation District Light Rail Training Quality Manual” (see Exhibit XVI and section 5, Biennial
Recertification and Practical Examinations).

4.2.4

Light Rail Maintenance Certification

Maintenance personnel, including Electromotive Mechanics, General Repair Mechanics, Track Maintainers,
and Signal and Power Maintainers receive classroom and hands-on training resembling a one-year
apprenticeship program. Maintenance personnel are certified at the end of one year, with demonstration of
passing scores on a written exam and hands-on practical exam.

4.2.5

Light Rail Maintenance Biennial Recertification

Every maintenance employee has an opportunity to receive up to 40 hours of annual refresher training
relating to their responsibilities. Recertification occurs every two years. Maintenance personnel must again
demonstrate passing scores on a written exam and a hands-on practical exam.

4.2.6

Bus Operator Training

Bus Operators must complete an eight-week training program, which consists of seven weeks of training
and one week of “conversion.” This training program covers rules and standard operating procedures
before entering revenue service. A series of 10 written tests are given throughout class sessions. The
certification consists of hands-on and classroom instruction. After the first two days of instruction, all class
participants spend time on a bus daily. Prior to entering service, operators must recevie a final examination
with a minimum correct score of 75% to pass. Operators must also obtain a CDL.
During the conversion week, operators drive on their own in revenue service while reporting back daily
to training for support. After completing the final week of “conversion” training, Operators transition from
Trainees to regular revenue service Operators.

Operator Recertification

Bus Operators undergo training after an extended absence from work. The general criteria for retraining
are as follows:
●

Operators who have been out of service for over 30 calendar days due to medical reasons or an
on-the-job injury will be required to retrain at least one day before returning to service

●

Operators who have been out of service for up to 90 calendar days due to a non-medical leave
of absence or vacation will be required to undergo retraining for at least one day before returning
to service

●

Any Operator who is away from the job over 30 calendar days may request and receive retraining
before returning to service

●

Bus Operators also receive training on new equipment and major changes in procedures.

4.2.8

Bus Maintenance Certification

The General Repair Certification Program is a structural program for General Repair Mechanics. This
program is voluntary, self-paced, and designed to help employees increase their skills and expertise
and to improve opportunity for promotion. The certification process assures that Mechanics have the
qualifications, knowledge, and skills to perform their jobs. This program has been divided into the following
eight zones, which represent the major skills that Mechanics must have: chassis, power train, electrical,
air systems, preventative maintenance, wheelchair lifts, heating and air conditioning, and brakes
service capabilities.

4.2.9

Bus Maintenance Recertification

Mechanics are recertified after one year.

4.2.10

Safety Training for Safety Personnel and Other Units

Safety personnel receive regular system safety training by attending American Public Transportation
Association (APTA) seminars and safety-specific training classes. The training includes the Rail System Safety
Course presented by the Transportation Safety Institute and other courses covering occupational safety.
Personnel outside the safety unit may receive the Rail System Safety Course and attend APTA seminars.
System safety personnel conduct in-house training for RTD personnel regarding safety certification, hazard
analysis, and construction safety.

Legal Services, and Materials Management divisions to ensure that all applicable safety and training
requirements are included in the contract.

4.3.3

Work-Required Training for Employees and Contractors

The Safety Division develops safety policies and procedures for occupational safety modeled on OSHA
guidelines. Regular training sessions are conducted with affected employees based on job hazard analysis.
Annual refresher training is conducted for high-risk tasks and activities.
All employees and contractor personnel who foul or have the potential to foul the tracks (within 10 feet
of centerline of track) must receive OTST prior to beginning their work. Contractors are responsible for
ensuring that their employees complete OSHA-required training prior to performing RTD projects.

4.3.4

Contractor Safety Coordination and Construction Safety

All contractor work on or near RTD rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing an access
permit, the contractor is required to meet with RTD staff to describe and coordinate their work. After
this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit, which is reviewed and approved by Light
Rail Maintenance of Way, Rail Operations, and Safety prior to signature issue by Light Rail Control. The
contractor is bound to the requirements of the permit. All contractors working with RTD are also bound by
contract specifications for the work they are to perform.
The Safety Division has developed two documents for the management of construction safety: the
Construction Safety Guidelines, and the Safety and Security Certification Plan. The Construction
Safety Guidelines presents the requirements for construction projects and follows OSHA construction
requirements and regulations. Contractors are required to follow OSHA construction safety requirements
and requirements of contract specifications and access permits.
The Safety Division conducts construction safety oversight to monitor contractor workplace safety
and conformance to OSHA standards. Oversight includes contractor safety orientation prior to project
commencement, field monitoring, and site safety inspections. Periodic safety meetings are conducted
between RTD and contractors to ensure safe project construction.
The Safety and Security Certification Plan describes the process for project and construction verification.
The plan contains design and procurement specifications, field inspection documentation, equipment
testing requirements, and integrated testing procedures.

4.3.5

Construction Safety Requirements

The construction safety program is developed and managed by the Capital Programs Department
and Safety Division. This program defines construction safety functions and responsibilities and other
construction safety requirements such as safety equipment, documentation, and safety personnel. All

____________________________________________
Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations

I.

PURPOSE
The investigation of an incident/accident must produce information that leads to
corrective actions that prevent or reduce the number and severity of future
incident/accidents, if possible. The more complete the information, the easier it will
be to take the proper corrective actions.
For purposes of incident/accident prevention, investigations must be for fact finding,
not fault finding. This is not to imply that responsibility may not be fixed where
human error has caused an incident/accident or that persons should be excused from
the consequences of their actions. Rather, the investigation should be concerned only
with the facts.

II.

DEFINITIONS
Field Investigation Team (FIT) Investigation
The Field Investigation Team is a group of representatives from Light Rail Operations,
Safety, Claims, and Media Relations. The FIT is activated as required by the
investigating supervisor on the scene. Generally, the Team will be activated to
investigate incident/accidents that are serious in nature; however, personal injury and
extent of damage will not be the sole criteria. Department Managers are responsible
for providing Control with a current list of representatives for notification.
The investigating supervisor is responsible for requesting activation of the Team.
Light Rail Central Control is responsible for notification of Team members.
Notification of Team members may be delegated by Central Control to other
operations or safety personnel. The Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental
Compliance or designee is responsible for coordination of the investigation. When
activated, the Field Investigation Team will:

INCIDENT/ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION

Packet Pg. 144



Perform an on-site investigation.



Conduct interviews.



Preserve, collect and analyze data.

All reports, materials and information relative to the incident/accident will be
forwarded to the Senior Manager of Safety and Environmental Compliance, who will
submit a final report of the Team's findings to the General Manager, Senior
Management, the Executive Safety and Security Committee, and appropriate
agencies indicating most probable cause, contributing factors, conclusions and
recommendations.
Members of the Field Investigation Team are not to become involved in the restoration
of service, but should assure that the scene of the incident/accident is preserved until
the initial investigation is completed. The FIT consists of the following members.


Assistant General Manager, Safety, Security and Asset Management (Chair)



Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations



Senior Manager, Safety and Environment



General Superintendent, Rail Transportation



General Superintendent, LRV Maintenance





Conduct interviews.



Gather and collect data.



Submit a report to the Controller based on the information collected.

III. PROCEDURE
Page 3 of 12

Packet Pg. 146

The Controller will dispatch a Light Rail Supervisor immediately to the scene of an
incident as deemed appropriate by the Controller. The Supervisor will be responsible
for the completion of the investigation. In the event of an incident occurring within
jurisdiction of the City and County of Denver, the Denver Police Department will allow
RTD Street Supervisors to cover and clear the incident if the following criteria apply:


No injuries



Under $1000 damage



No indication either driver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs



No uninsured drivers involved



No dispute as to the party at fault

 Each driver possesses a valid driver's license
If more than one Supervisor is able to respond to the scene of an incident/accident,
the Controller should designate an "Investigating Supervisor" to be responsible for
persons and equipment at the scene. A second Supervisor may be asked to assist at
the scene or to assist with the continued movement of other trains on the mainline.
The Controller will request the LRV Maintenance Department to provide appropriate
representatives to be sent to the scene to assure the proper functioning of equipment
for which they are responsible. These personnel may advise the Controller of any
restrictions to operation.
Once appropriate staff has been dispatched, and information required for Safety is
acquired, the responsible Controller will promptly notify the designated safety
representative as they have a two-hour threshold to notify PUC.
Grade Crossing Reportable Accidents
Incidents involving the contact of trains with other vehicles should be cleared as soon
as possible by the Light Rail Transportation Supervisor after an exchange of
identification and information with the other party and all other information necessary
to complete the investigation is obtained. It is not necessary to lower the LRV
pantograph for incidents except when necessary to go under the LRV to remove
debris or during side impacts when damage of equipment boxes has occurred.
The Operator/Supervisor must obtain the following:


Make, model, color and year of the vehicle(s) involved and the license plate
number(s).



Driver's name, address and telephone number.

1.B.4.b

In 2016, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) mandated that every federally funded transit agency
in the United States must have a Transit Asset Management Plan in place by October 2018. The FTA
has expressed concern with the sustainability of transit assets due to the backlog of renewals of
approximately $105 billion nationwide (June 22, 2021). The federal Moving Ahead for Progress in the
21st Century (MAP-21) act highlighted Washington’s change focus from construction to longer term
stewardship (2012).
This Regional Transportation District (RTD) Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan is a formal report
that meets the FTA TAM requirements under MAP-21.
A Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan is the cornerstone of asset stewardship. It is the public case
for investment in the assets to justify the use of tax dollars and fares to meet community
requirements. It aims to demonstrate the best use of funding to deliver services now and into the
future.
Accordingly, this document summarizes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The principles RTD uses to make asset decisions aligned to agency priorities
The assets RTD uses in the provision of public transportation
The current state of those assets for which RTD has capital responsibility
How RTD makes asset investment decisions
The proposed capital investment plan for the period 2021-2027
Actions to further improve asset management decision-making
How this plan will be evaluated for continuous improvement

RTD, like all transit agencies, is highly asset-intensive. In the past fifteen years, the agency has spent
approximately $6.4 billion on expansion, including new rail and bus rapid transit lines.
When MAP-21 was passed in 2012, RTD dedicated staff resources to focus on asset management and
began to review data regarding the details of assets RTD owns and manages in its asset inventory as
well as the condition of these assets, using the principle of State of Good Repair (SGR). Though RTD
initially collected this information voluntarily, the FTA now requires this data collection from all
transit agencies.
RTD was among the first transit agencies to declare an intention to meet FTA TAM requirements by
developing an International Standards Organization (ISO) 55000 certified asset management system
(AMS). However, RTD has struggled to make the changes in agency culture necessary to accomplish
this objective. The pursuit of ISO 55000 certification remains instrumental in the agency’s approach
developing an effective and efficient AMS. An improved AMS will yield better decision-making across
the asset portfolio for asset optimization. Further progress towards developing an ISO 55000 and
TAM compliant AMS is anticipated, though it will take great effort in order to transform the agency
into a model of asset management in the transit industry.

Executive Summary

Page | 4
Packet Pg. 170

By 2017, RTD had put in place the first steps towards an integrated process to prioritize all capital
investment by agency objectives. This has further been refined to categorize all investment proposals
by compliance, renewal, or enhancement, with the intention of funding projects in that order to
ensure good stewardship. This encourages investment in maintaining existing assets before funding
new asset or non-asset projects. In 2020, recognizing a need for improvement in asset information
staff implemented an Asset Information Maturity (AIM) effort to assess the quality of information for
use in decision-making, to formulate plans for AIM improvements as warranted, and to execute the
documented improvement plans.
This process forms the basis for this TAM Plan, along with RTD’s commitment to continue to develop
its asset management practices.
RTD is actively involved in transit asset management thought-leadership, through the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA) and Transportation Research Board (TRB). RTD examples were
used by the FTA in its TAM Facility Performance Measure Reporting Guidebook (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2018) and the TAM Systems Handbook (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2020). In
addition to transit-specific asset management community involvement, RTD participates more
broadly in asset management, by co-chairing the local chapter of the Global Institute of Asset
Management (IAM) and participating in the planning group for the International IAM. RTD’s TAMP
has been included in the FTA’s resource library as an exemplar of such a plan.
This broad involvement in asset management across industries, as well as deep involvement in
transit-specific asset management leads RTD to believe that a shift in culture is needed in order to
improve the agency’s stewardship of assets using better information and decision tools and achieve
better outcomes in performance, fiscal responsibility, risk management and value creation for the
Region.
RTD’s long-term asset management strategy is to make consistently sound decisions across RTD’s
asset portfolio and asset systems to deliver customer needs in a financially sustainable and safe way,
using the ISO 55000 framework. This effort has led to the implementation of an investment planning
process for planning and budgeting, as well as the goal of achieving ISO 55000 certification.
An ISO 55000 health check, a mid-point review of the entire AMS against the requirements of ISO
55000, was conducted in 2019. The health check identified risks to achieving certification, one of
which was lack of “leadership and commitment.” (AMCL, 2019) Shortly after the health check, then
GM/CEO Genova announced his retirement and in 2020 an interim GM/CEO was hired to be at the
helm of the agency while a search was conducted for a long-term replacement. Though not without
challenges, RTD made progress towards the goal of attaining ISO 55000 certification in 2020.
However, the agency is still well short of being able to seek certification and does not currently have a
target date for doing so. Following a selection of a new GM/CEO in 2020, improvements in RTD’s AMS
are set as goals in the 5-Year Strategic Plan, and work towards eventual ISO 55000 certification can
continue.

The AMS in RTD is being developed in close coordination with the safety management system, with
both informed by a risk-based prioritization approach with the intention of developing that approach
into an enterprise risk framework.
RTD’s mission is to make lives better through connections and its vision is to be the trusted leader in
mobility, delivering excellence and value to our customers and community. (RTD, 2021) The
communities RTD serves should know how the agency invests taxpayer dollars and how decisions are
made regarding the best use of limited resources. This is done through transparency in decision
processes to sustain the condition and performance of the assets.

3. DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS

What tools and
processes does RTD use
to prioritize funding
around those assets
described in its
inventory?

On an annual basis, RTD prepares and updates a six-year Mid Term Financial Plan
(MTFP) which includes projected capital construction and improvements, service levels
and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Part of
the MTFP process includes prioritization of projects into three funding categories:
Compliance, Renewal, and Enhancement.

4. PRIORITIZED LIST OF INVESTMENTS

What is the result or
output of those decision
support tools and
processes?

The two primary lists of projects are created through the MTFP process: Capital Projects
and Capital Maintenance Projects. Each list is subdivided into the three funding
categories noted above.

1.B.4.b

What are the guiding
principles for asset
management efforts at
RTD?

RTD adopted an asset management policy in June 2014 and most recently updated
April 2021.
The intent of the policy is to improve how RTD manages assets from now on - it is
therefore forward-looking in nature and represents the Agency’s vision and shared
commitment for good Asset Management at RTD. The Asset Management System
applies to the entire organization and directs the short, medium, and long-term plans
for assets to achieve the agency mission of making lives better through connections.

6. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

How is RTD going to
execute the TAM plan?

RTD has chosen ISO 55000 as the framework to build its AMS. As part of that choice,
the agency performed a gap assessment to determine the necessary tasks needed to
achieve ISO 55000 certification.

7. LIST OF KEY ANNUAL ACTIVITIES

What activities does RTD
perform to maintain its
TAM system?

RTD identifies two types of asset management activities: those ongoing asset
management activities performed as part of ‘business as usual,’ and those activities
specific to achieving ISO 55000 certification. TAM activities are the subset of these ISO
activities targeting specific TAM elements.

8. IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES

What resources are
needed to execute RTD
TAM plan activities?

Personnel from across the Agency are involved in asset management activities,
including the General Manager/CEO, the Senior Leadership Team, the Asset
Management Division (AMD), Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Administration,
Communications, Planning, and General Counsel departments.
The AMD’s in-house expertise enables the agency to employ robust asset management
practices. From 2012 through 2018, the AMD added additional staff in two key areas:
physical asset business analysis and data science.

9. EVALUATION PLAN

What is the Agency
doing to ensure that the
TAM plan delivers the
intended results?

There are two primary areas of the evaluation plan; the TAM Plan itself and ISO 55000.
The current TAM Plan provides the baseline for evaluating the agency’s future plans.
RTD intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting maturity targets
in its Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP).
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements for ISO
55000, and therefore its readiness for an ISO 55001 certification audit, through the
following measures:
• ISO spot checks
• ISO health check
• ISO mock audit
• ISO audit
• ISO surveillance audits

1.1

Background

On June 29, 2012, Congress passed the MAP-21 act. In accordance with section 20019 of this law, the
FTA established mandatory standards for all transit providers. The final implemented regualtion was
published in the Federal Register on July 26, 2016 with an effective date of October 1, 2016 (Transit
Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016). As illustrated in Table 2, RTD is a Tier I Agency,
meaning all TAM requirements apply to the agency.
The FTA requirements for a TAM Plan are as follows:
Tier

Element
1. An inventory of
assets

Brief Description
A register of capital assets and information about those
assets

2. A condition
assessment of
inventoried assets

A rating of the assets' physical state; to be completed for
assets an agency has direct capital responsibility for;
should be at a level of detail sufficient to monitor and
predict performance of inventoried assets

3. Description of a
decision support tool

An analytic process or tool that (1) assists in capital asset
investment prioritization and/or (2) estimates capital
needs over time (does not necessarily mean software)

4. A prioritized list of
investments

A prioritized list of projects or programs to manage or
improve the SGR of capital assets

5. TAM and SGR policy

A TAM policy is the executive-level direction regarding
expectations for transit asset management; a TAM strategy
consists of the actions that support the implementation of
the TAM policy

6. Implementation
strategy

The operational actions that a transit provider decides to

Asset Management Policy

An Asset Management (AM) Policy is a documented commitment to achieving and maintaining a
state of good repair for all capital assets. The FTA has defined state of good repair as “The condition
in which a capital asset is able to operate at a full level of performance” (Transit Asset Management;
National Transit Database, 2016).
RTD’s Asset Management Policy was updated on September 28, 2021. The policy describes a
forward-looking commitment to good asset management practice, intended to pursue investment
optimization across the entire asset portfolio to maximize its value. Asset management performed
according to this policy will result in assets that are in a state of good repair.

The Regional Transportation District provides transportation services to 3.08 million people located
within its 2,342 square mile service area, such services include bus, rail, shuttles, paratransit services,
demand responsive microtransit services, and special event services. Though operating a significantly
reduced schedule to match current levels of demand, RTD used these assets to provide nearly 36
Million revenue miles on 143 bus and rail routes, in 2020.

2.1

The RTD Story
The Colorado General Assembly created RTD in 1969. Efforts in early years focused on
regional transportation planning. In 1973, voters approved a 0.5% sales tax initiative to
finance a multi-modal transit system. At this time, RTD acquired privately owned bus
companies, improved service frequencies, and expanded routes in several counties
throughout the metro area. By 1976, ridership had grown to 35 million rides annually.
RTD celebrated its first light rail opening in October 1994. With a fleet of only 11 light
rail vehicles, the 5.3-mile D Line attracted hundreds of thousands of customers when it
began operations with just eleven light rail vehicles. Now, eight light rail lines service 57
stations along seven individually constructed corridors.

In November 2004, voters approved the FasTracks ballot measure for the region-wide
expansion of transit service. The 0.4% sales and use tax continues to fund the FasTracks program
which has grown to include 122 miles of new commuter rail and light rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit
corridor, and numerous rail and bus stations. The program consists of six new rapid transit corridors
and three existing corridor extensions.

2.2

RTD Service Area

The RTD service area is composed of eight counties including all of Boulder, Broomfield, Denver and
Jefferson counties, large areas of Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties, and a small portion of
Weld County.

In 2000, RTD provided approximately 77 million passenger trips. (U.S. Department of Transportation,
2000) By 2019, passenger trips grew to 105 million, a 30% increase in boardings. Over the same
period, per the Colorado State Demographer’s Office, the Denver/Boulder region increased from
approximately 2.4 million residents to approximately 3.2 million residents, a 31% increase (2019).

RTD Assets

RTD is an asset-intensive organization. RTD’s Statement of Net Position notes that capital assets total
nearly $7.6 billion (Regional Transportation District, 2020), of which most is in the scope of TAM as
detailed in this section. Much of this total expenditure resulted in assets in the scope of Transit Asset
Management as detailed in this section.
As assets are operated, their condition degrades over time, and their risk of failure increases. Failures
including those having an impact on safety, can manifest in a variety of ways. Asset condition is
therefore a leading indicator for safety risks, and understanding asset condition today, and how
quickly it might degrade in the future, is an important aspect of good asset, safety and risk
management. Organizations that know their assets’ deterioration rates can also make more
informed decisions on renewal frequencies and their approach to preventive maintenance.
For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD has categorized its assets in accordance with FTA guidelines:
revenue vehicles, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure, using the flowchart depicted in Figure 5
below, adherence to which ensures repeatable results and an improvement in inventory data quality.

RTD’s revenue vehicle fleet is composed of 1,427 buses and 201 light rail vehicles. Sixty-six commuter
rail vehicles are operated by a third-party, Denver Transit Operators (DTO).
Transit vehicles in the agency’s rubber tire fleet include:
•
•
•
•

Standard 40’ fixed-route transit buses with a capacity of 40 passengers
Fixed-route articulated buses with 33% greater capacity than standard buses
Regional intercity coaches, such as the Flatiron Flyer, built for longer trips at highway speed,
which are typically 45 feet long and have a seated capacity of 55 passengers
Cutaways which are made by second stage manufacturers, using the chassis of full size vans,
used to provide on-demand service for eligible passengers with disabilities (Access-a-Ride)
and in areas where ridership does not support fixed route service (FlexRide)

RTD buses are procured from a variety of manufacturers including: Gillig, BYD, New Flyer, MCI,
Goshen, Eldorado, and Startrans. Approximately 50% of standard and articulated fixed route buses
are operated and maintained by RTD, with the operations and maintenance for the remainder
outsourced6 to two external partner companies, First Transit and TransDev. All intercity coaches are
operated and maintained by RTD, and all cutaway buses are operated and maintained by third parties
(Via Transportation, MV Transportation and Evergreen Senior Center).

Light rail vehicles (LRV) are electrically powered using a 750-volt DC overhead catenary system.
Individual vehicles can be coupled together to form up to four cars per consist, with a seated capacity
of 64 per car. LRVs can carry up to 236 passengers per car utilizing the standing room. All light rail
vehicles are manufactured by Siemens and are acquired, owned, operated and maintained by RTD.

Figure 10: Light Rail Vehicle (Siemens SD-160)

All commuter rail vehicles are operated under the FasTracks program, and their ongoing maintenance
is outsourced to a third-party, Denver Transit Operators. RTD will assume ownership at the end of
the contracted period of performance of 30 years. Condition assessments will not be performed on
these assets until such time as RTD assumes capital responsibility for the vehicles.

Figure 11: Commuter Rail Vehicle (Hyundai Rotem)

RTD has historically managed its revenue vehicle inventory based on age: the vehicles are procured,
maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years through a preventative
maintenance program, and then replaced. This approach is adopted for revenue vehicles maintained
by third parties, including bus and commuter rail.
Table 3 below presents the total number of revenue vehicles for which RTD has capital responsibility,
along with their Useful Life Benchmark (ULB), which is the expected duration in years that an asset
will remain in service according to RTD’s standards and the average condition based on its age. The
condition range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the vehicle is significantly beyond its useful life
benchmark and 5 is considered new. A vehicle that has reached the end of its useful life benchmark
is scored at 2.5 and from that point onwards is considered in backlog.
RTD’s current renewal approach for revenue vehicles is to keep them operating reliably and safely
beyond their useful life benchmark with maintenance intervals and interventions based on cost and
performance trade-offs. Table 3 provides the backlog for each vehicle type. RTD uses the FTA
definition for revenue vehicle backlog, which is the percentage of revenue vehicles that have met or
exceeded their useful life benchmark (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016).
RTD’s bus fleet has been a focus of renewals, though some transit buses are now considered to be in
backlog. Based on a combination of vehicle performance, condition, and cost of maintaining rather
than replacing vehicles, some transit buses will continue to be operated in backlog.
Table 3 also presents the total initial capital cost 7 of the vehicles in each sub-fleet.

7 In the future, RTD intends to determine the whole-life cost (e.g., capital expense and operating expense) of its assets and

this will be considered for inclusion in a subsequent generation of the TAMP.

Equipment
For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD’s equipment assets include non-revenue vehicles and non-vehicle
equipment costing over $50,000. RTD owns 48 automobiles, four steel wheel non-revenue vehicles
and 378 rubber tire non-revenue vehicles. Non-vehicle equipment consists of various types of
machinery such as non-self-propelled rail tampers, equipment hoists, and storeroom stacking
systems. The current inventory of 67 assets is detailed in Appendix H, though a complete inventory is
in progress. The facilities equipment inventory registry is incomplete, in many cases lacking
information such as expected useful life, cost, in-service dates, unique identifiers and whatever
information does exist is located in disparate resources that may lack controls needed to keep
information current. Current efforts around asset information maturity and the continued
incremental improvements of the AMP are specifically designed to address this information gap. The
gap has been identified, and corrective methods have begun to be implemented. As described in the
summary, there are some areas of the organization that are more engaged in the improvement
efforts.
Equipment is purchased from a variety of manufacturers and is owned, operated and maintained by
RTD.

RTD has historically managed its non-revenue vehicle equipment inventory based on age; the
equipment is procured, maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years through
preventative maintenance and then replaced.8 As such, condition scores for non-revenue vehicle
equipment are age-based.
Table 5 below presents the total number of non-revenue vehicle assets, along with their useful life
benchmark (ULB), and a score representing the condition of the equipment based on its age. The
score range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the asset is significantly beyond its useful life benchmark
and 5 is considered new. An asset that has reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that
point onwards is considered in backlog. RTD uses the FTA definition for non-revenue vehicle backlog,
which is the percentage of vehicles that have met or exceeded their useful life benchmark. A nonrevenue vehicle that has reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that point onwards is
considered in backlog (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016).

Facilities
For the purposes of this TAMP, RTD owns:
•
•
•
•

5 administration facilities where RTD administration functions take place
9 maintenance facilities where maintenance work takes place
121 public facilities, which includes stations, buildings and other structures where customers
can board or disembark from an RTD transit vehicle
111 conveyances such as elevators and escalators, installed within facilities. These are treated
here separately based on National Transit Database (NTD) reporting requirements

Administration, maintenance, and public facilities for which RTD has capital responsibility are
operated and maintained by RTD, although some services, such as cleaning and snow removal, may
be contracted to third parties. Conveyance manufacturers include Kone and ThyssenKrupp and
conveyance maintenance is outsourced to third parties.

Figure 16: Bus Maintenance Facility

RTD has historically managed its facilities and their related equipment on a reactive basis, i.e., the
practice has been to maintain or replace the assets when they fail. The more critical facility elements,
such as underground storage tanks and boilers, have redundancy built in to minimize service
interruptions when they fail to perform as designed. RTD fully complies with all regulations relating
to safety inspections for certain facility assets (Regional Transportation District, 2016).

Since 2015, RTD has performed in-house assessments to determine the condition score of individual
elements of each facility for which RTD has capital responsibility. As such, facility condition scores are
assessment-based.

Figure 17: Light Rail Maintenance Facility

Figure 18: Public Facility

The condition score of each of the elements that exist at an administration or maintenance facility is
averaged to provide the condition score of the facility. Currently, each extant facility element is
weighted equally. The following table presents the elements of each facility that are assigned an
individual condition score. Not all facilities have all listed elements.

Conveyance inspections are outsourced to third parties in accordance with applicable legislation and
regulations but are not used to determine condition. These assets are managed on an age-based
approach consistent with regulatory standards. Both preventative and reactive maintenance
activities are performed by third parties, and the activities delivered under these contractual
agreements are monitored by RTD staff to ensure contract adherence and acceptable performance of
the assets.
Table 8 presents the total number of facility assets for which RTD has capital responsibility, along with

RTD owns light rail infrastructure including grade crossings, catenary wire segments, track, relay
cases, switches, and substations, as well as light rail vehicle bridges, and commuter rail alignments
operated and maintained by a third party.

Figure 20: Light Rail Vehicle Bridge

Light rail infrastructure is purchased or constructed by a
variety of manufacturers and is owned, operated and
maintained by RTD. All commuter rail infrastructure is
delivered under the FasTracks program and its ongoing
operation and maintenance is outsourced to a third
party, Denver Transit Operators. RTD will assume
ownership for commuter rail infrastructure at the end of
the contracted period of performance (30 years).
Condition assessments will not be performed on these
assets until such time as RTD assumes capital
responsibility.

Figure 21: Track Infrastructure

RTD has historically managed light rail infrastructure assets based on age but has performed
condition assessments of right-of-way light rail infrastructure for three years. In doing so, RTD
determined that age-based condition scores provided similar levels of accuracy as assessment-based
condition scores, and so has stopped performing condition assessments. As such, light rail
infrastructure condition scores are age-based (Regional Transportation District, 2017).
Seventy-seven light rail vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by RTD. Seven light rail vehicle
bridges are owned and maintained by third parties.
Light rail vehicle bridges are inspected once every two years by an independent third-party contractor
per state law. The inspection reports received by the inspection agency describe the condition of
seven bridge elements: abutments, caps, deck, girders/beams, head/wing walls, PPC (pillars, piers,
columns) and railings. The inspection report condition data is turned into an SGR score from 1 to 5
for each element. All the element scores are averaged together to give an SGR score for the bridge
(Regional Transportation District, 2016). As such, condition scores for bridges for which RTD has
capital responsibility are assessment-based. Condition assessments for bridges owned and
maintained by third-parties are not recorded in the TAMP.

Table 14 represents the number, EUL, and age-based score for key directly operated commuter rail
assets.
Table 15 represents the directly operated commuter rail track by type, noting the differences in EUL
between the types and relevant age-based scores.
Tables 16 and 17 represent the FTA performance measure for infrastructure which is the percentage
of guideway directional route miles (DRM) with performance restrictions by light rail and commuter
rail by class, respectively. However, RTD anticipates that the guideway under performance restriction
measure may not be an adequate measure of condition for rail infrastructure assets in the future
(U.S. Department of Transportation, 2017).
There are many reasons why rail infrastructure assets would be placed under a temporary
performance restriction such as routine maintenance, the presence of inspection personnel in the
right of way, or police activity at or near crossings. These reasons provide no indication of the
condition of the assets. Additionally, track assets that are in very poor condition but that exist in a
high-density urban environment may not have a performance restriction because the design speed is
low in such areas. The age of these assets along with physical inspections will likely be more useful
for investment decisions; consequently, RTD also provides age-based condition and backlog scores for
light rail infrastructure assets.
RTD’s first light rail line opened in 1994, assets of that era, with an EUL of 25 years, are currently
shown in backlog in Table 11. However this may not reflect the true condition of the assets. Major
repairs to assets, such as replacement or refurbishment of components, extends the life of those
assets, such improvements have not been recorded in a system of record. The Asset Management
Division is working with light rail maintenance of way to improve asset information and to begin
recording major repairs of assets in a system of record for reporting, compliance, and planning
purposes.
Tables 11, 12, and 13 also present the total initial capital cost for each light rail asset type.
RTD’s first directly operated commuter rail line opened in 2020. The asset information for this line
does not reside in a single system of record. Work was performed to improve inventory for this class
of assets according to the AIM plan authored by the asset class’ designated steward, though those
efforts were not entirely successful. Work will continue in 2022 to improve asset inventory
information. Though assets were capitalized according to RTD’s accounting practices, the level of
granularity at which projects are completed and subsequently capitalized does not always easily lend
the clarity needed for translating a multi-million dollar project line item into individual asset costs.
Additional work to identify costs to facilitate reporting congruent with other asset classes and to
support the inclusion of these assets into the AMP will continue in 2022.

updated accordingly (Regional Transportation District, 2020). The performance restrictions for years prior to 2020 are
presented using the metrics that were in place during those periods.

3 Current Capital Investment Decision Process
The capital improvement component of RTD’s fiscal policy states that “On an annual basis, RTD will
prepare and update a six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan including projected capital construction and
improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating
programs.” (Regional Transportation District, 2016)
The MTFP also provides the basis for the agency’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG). The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive
federal funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying MTFP projects
are included in the TIP.
In 2021, at the time of reporting, RTD’s Board of Directors has yet to approve an updated MTFP for
the period 2022-2027.
Projects initiated in 2021 and currently underway will continue to be funded. However, funding for
future projects may be approved on as as-needed basis as opposed to the method established in the
Capital Improvement Policy. Since no updated MTFP has been approved at the time of this reporting
and the Capital Improvement Policy been not amended, the following process and list of prioritized
investments is based on the 2021-2026 MTFP.
The 2021-2026 MTFP includes projects funded from the base system’s 0.6% sales and use taxes.
Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2021-2026 are presented separately
in the FasTracks financial plan (Regional Transportation District, 2016).
The process used to prioritize investments for the 2021-2026 MTFP is built upon a legacy project
prioritization process. The process is shown in Figure 22 below.
For some time, RTD has continually improved the sophistication of its investment planning and
prioritization process. The agency has moved from a process that was primarily the product of
professional judgement to a more standardized method of evaluating capital projects. The intent of
this process is to align all investment with the AM Policy, agency objectives, and Strategic Asset
Management Plan.
An important additional element of an investment planning process is an evaluation step that has yet
to be implemented. This step will determine the degree to which projects were completed within
budget and on schedule and whether they accomplished the desired outcome. Stated outcomes will
be part of a required business case that describes the intended effect of the capital project on the
agency objectives. This will better allow RTD to continuously improve its investment prioritization
process.

Attachment: RTD_PTASP_Exhibits_2022_Final (4596 : 2022 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Table 18: Third-Party Infrastructure Assets Inventory

One key step implemented toward the next generation process is the classification and prioritization
of capital projects based on three categories:

Transit Asset Management Plan 2021

Page | 33
Packet Pg. 199

1. Compliance
2. Renewal
3. Enhancement
The goal of this process is asset-focused investments to prioritize sustainable management of existing
assets over expansion of the transit system. An investment planning process will serve as one of
RTD’s decision support tools.

The output of the current capital investment decision process is a list of prioritized capital projects.
For 2021-2027, the list is separated into two project types and each project type is broken down into
three funding categories. As the agency’s AMP is focused on the renewal and replacement of existing
assets, only the prioritized renewal and replacement needs are reflected in the TAM Plan.

5 Improving Asset Management Capabilities at RTD
As a 52 year old agency, RTD has not experienced the decaying infrastructure or immediate funding
shortages that many older and larger transit systems have. Historically, RTD has had the necessary
funding in place and the professional expertise to maintain its transit assets in a state of good repair
while meeting the growing demand for service. However, as mentioned in the executive summary,
RTD’s backlog of existing assets is growing and will experience swells of assets achieving EUL such as
those from pre-FasTracks expansion activities including the original light rail alignment known as the
Metro Area Circulator (MAC) or Central Corridor, the Southwest light rail alignment, the Southeast
rail alignment that was a component of the T-REX project, and the Central Platte Valley (CPV)
extension. Presently the AMP records reflect a funding need of over $187 million for 2022, which is
largely accounts for the backlog for assets in the scope of TAM. The asset renewal and replacement
needs are expected to be $453M for the 2022-2028 planning period. The actual funding needs are
likely higher due to assets out of scope of TAM, assets that have yet to be recognized in the AMS, and
uncertainty around the infrastructure and facilities needs that result from a lack of controlled and
available asset information on which to formulate data-driven plans.
RTD’s asset management maturity improvement initiative was not initially driven by a growing set of
decaying assets, but rather by the expansion of the asset base in recent years. Beginning with the TREX project and continuing with the current FasTracks project, over the past 15 years RTD has spent
over $6.4 billion on new rail and bus rapid transit service.
The funding for the most recent expansion projects did not make provision for the long-term
maintenance and capital renewal of the new assets. Without a solid, long-term renewal plan in place,
with funding earmarked, the risk of a growing backlog of renewal projects without adequate funding
is too great. A growing backlog for any transit agency increases risk to safety, service, and future
sustainability; it feeds a pattern of expensive reactionary repair and remediation tasks.
RTD’s bold increase in the scope of its transit system requires a more rigorous management process
than in the past if it is to maximize value from the assets. To avoid the asset condition backlog that
plagues some agencies, RTD intends to take the path toward good whole-life asset management
while the assets are relatively new.
RTD is preparing an AMP that addresses future funding needs for existing assets, prioritizing renewals
over enhancements. The original cost of assets is less useful to the agency than projected future
costs. Therefore RTD’s efforts emphasize creating accurate and increasingly precise estimates of the
investments that are needed over the coming budget planning cycle.
The AMP is the combined output of individual Asset Class Strategies that focus on what will need to
be renewed, when it will need to be renewed, and the expected costs of renewals. The AMP will
determine which assets are included for renewal or replacement in the investment prioritization
process. The projected funding needs over the period 2022-2028 are illustrated in the graphs that
follow.

Strategic Asset Management Plan

RTD aims to comply fully with MAP-21 requirements for transit asset management and beyond. It
has developed an overall Strategic Asset Management Plan to summarize its strategy to improve
asset management over the next period.
From 2004, with the publication of BSI PAS-55, and then ISO 55000 in 2014, organizations have been
able to exploit a standardized good practice framework for implementing an aligned AMS.
Typically, organizations begin with a focus on asset information; particularly the inventory of all their
assets and assessing asset condition. This information supports clearer planning, because this allows
the organization to fully assess its assets and their condition. The aim is not just a clear plan to cover
all the assets, however, rather a prioritized and optimized plan based on understanding the risks to
objectives and using this to make the best use of limited resources.
RTD has invested heavily in both its asset inventory and asset condition measures over the past five
years and has begun its transition to an integrated planning process that will optimize its asset base.
The current strategy is to achieve certification to ISO 55000 and to use this as the foundation to align
the management of its assets to the agency purpose and objectives.
In 2017, RTD commissioned an external gap assessment comparing current practices to the ISO 55000
standard. The results of the gap assessment were used to create an Asset Management Roadmap for
the Agency to achieve certification to the ISO standard (AMCL, 2017). The Roadmap is included in
Appendix D.

Key Annual Activities

RTD identifies two types of asset management activity: those ongoing asset management activities
that RTD performs as part of “business as usual,” and those activities specific to achieving ISO 55000
certification. TAM activities are the subset of these targeting the specific TAM elements, and these
are shown in a third section below.

Figure 30: Asset Management Activities

“Business as Usual” Asset Management Activities
As an asset-intensive organization, RTD already performs a number of asset management activities on
a routine basis, and these will continue to improve through the TAM Plan horizon.

Packet Pg. 212

This section summarizes those “business as usual” activities, using the Institute of Asset
Management’s Conceptual Model for Asset Management (2015) to categorize into six main blocks.
This should not be interpreted to imply these ongoing activities are all necessarily well aligned or
integrated at present.

Figure 31: The Institute of Asset Management (IAM) Conceptual Model for Asset Management

The Planning department periodically conducts demand analysis for its transit
service and uses this to support long-term strategic planning for system
optimization, expansion and enhancement. At present, strategic planning for
capital renewals and maintenance volumes is not formally performed, though RTD anticipates the
need to enhance its capabilities in this area through the development of asset class strategies and an
AMP (see next section for details). Although not yet a “business as usual” activity, in undertaking the
development of this TAM Plan, RTD has started on asset management planning.
RTD’s current approach to capital investment decision-making is described in
Section 3, and this activity is performed annually to develop the MTFP.
Operations and maintenance decision-making is performed within each asset
owner group but does not currently formally consider or align with agency objectives.
Ongoing activities include capital project processes for asset acquisition,
which is split between the Capital Programs department for commuter rail
(FasTracks) and facility assets and operations for rail, bus and rail
infrastructure assets. Compliance with appropriate technical standards and legislation is ensured
within the capital projects and operations/maintenance functions, with some basic configuration
management principles applied to in-house engineering designs. Maintenance delivery occurs for
each major asset class and includes preventive and corrective maintenance, along with condition
assessments. Some asset classes have a larger focus on preventative maintenance, while others have
more emphasis on corrective maintenance and maintain assets when they fail. Most maintenance

delivery is performed by staff, with some being outsourced. Asset operations are a significant part of
RTD’s ongoing activities, and includes bus, rail, equipment and infrastructure operations, some of
which are also outsourced. Basic resource management principles are applied to ensure enough
operational resources are available as needed. RTD also performs shutdown and outage
management of its assets to enable maintenance access. As assets develop operating faults, the
agency implements its fault and incident response plans in accordance with agreed methods.
RTD uses several asset information systems to manage its Asset Information,
including Trapeze EAM for asset inventory and maintenance management,
and the Oracle Enterprise Business Suite for related financial information.
Other systems including Bentley Optram and Railroad Software have been
added to address the specific requirements of light rail maintenance of way and directly operated
commuter rail maintenance of way (commonly referred to as North Metro). However, these systems
have not been fully integrated into organization processes.
There are several basic data and information management processes in effect, including regular
reporting to the National Transit Database (NTD), and regular data quality assessment and cleansing
processes for Trapeze EAM information. The Asset Management Division employs a data science and
analytics team to support designated asset stewards with collection, management, and analysis of
non-physical data. This group also performs data assurance tasks on corporate data and performs all
FTA TAM report preparation activities.
The RTD data science and analytics team also administers the asset information maturity (AIM)
process, having designed the framework, administered assessments, and provided significant
consultative guidance in the development of AIM improvement plans and professional support in the
execution of many analytics tasks within the plans.
RTD applies procurement and supply chain management principles for its
outsourced asset management functions. These include the capital delivery
of its FasTracks program, along with some ongoing operations and
maintenance of the assets the program delivers. The operation and
maintenance of approximately half of RTD’s bus services is outsourced to two service providers, and
the maintenance of certain facility assets, such as elevators, is also outsourced.
RTD’s Finance department uses standard accounting practices to perform
asset costing and valuation, including their valuation and deprecation of
assets over time. The Asset Management Division employs an asset
performance manager. Informal stakeholder management principles are
applied for engaging and managing key external stakeholders.

ISO 55000 Activities
In addition to the ongoing asset management activities described above, RTD also has activities
defined as part of its plan towards ISO 55000, or its Asset Management Roadmap.

The central requirement for ISO 55000 is to design, implement, maintain and continually improve an
Asset Management System based on Plan-Do-Check-Act principles. Once certification is achieved,
ongoing ISO 55000 activities will continue to occur indefinitely to maintain and continually improve
the AMS, while many of the ISO 55000 practices will transition to become “business as usual.”
The roadmap and associated detailed activities are held in the ISO 55000 Gap Assessment and
roadmap report, and a summary is provided below:
5.2.2.1 Design an Asset Management Organization
This includes the implementation of an ISO 55000 compliant AMS: the framework to define and
manage the key elements, including a policy, strategy and risk management framework, with clearly
defined roles and responsibilities.
5.2.2.2 Asset Management Planning
This includes the development of asset class strategies and an AMP as key elements of an investment
planning process.
5.2.2.3 Improve Rigor and Control
This implements improved control over core asset delivery and financial activities, and includes a
project management office for capital projects with a gated process for staged release of funding.
5.2.2.4 Assurance and Performance
The performance management framework is of key importance, as is well as an improved approach
to assessing the root cause of asset failures.
5.2.2.5 Enhance Asset Information
This is centered on the development and implementation of an asset information framework,
including definition of RTD’s information requirements and the strategies employed for meeting
them, along with clear governance for asset information.
5.2.2.6 Learning and Communication
This is to support the embedding of asset management awareness, culture and competencies, and
includes a training needs analysis and a program of appropriate asset management training, as well
as communication to raise awareness of Asset Management throughout the organization, and the
development of an appropriate Asset Management culture.
5.2.2.7 Enabling Activities
This is to support the delivery of the ISO 55000 Roadmap. They include:
•
•
•
•
•

Establishing and empowering an implementation team
Adopting a project management office (PMO) approach to the roadmap
Establishing governance and controls of the roadmap
Monitoring and reviewing progress, with adjustments made as necessary

1.B.4.b

ISO 55000 Strategy Activities
ISO 55000 requires the establishment of a functioning, effective, sufficiently resourced management
system for assets. The resourcing strategy is to establish clear accountability and responsibility for
the Asset Management System, with the authority to direct and allocate resources being granted to
the accountable group. The diagram below illustrates the accountability structure and other
contributors.

Figure 32: ISO 55000 Contributing Resource Groups

In late 2011, RTD assigned two employees the task of building an Asset Management Division (AMD).
The Division would eventually be responsible for improving the management of assets and building
an agency-wide AMS.
To ensure the most accurate, non-biased information possible, the Senior Leadership Team
determined the AMD should be independent of the asset delivery functions.
According to Chris Lloyd, asset management leadership and culture expert: “Strategic Asset
Management calls for risk-based decision making, cross-functional working, and long-term thinking. It
needs clarity on competence requirements and accountability and honesty about performance”
(Johnson and Lloyd, 2012).
The AMD was placed alongside the Safety Division, with both reporting to the Chief Safety Officer
(CSO) due to the nexus between asset condition and safety and their management system
frameworks. More details are in Appendix F.

Attachment: RTD_PTASP_Exhibits_2022_Final (4596 : 2022 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

As ISO 55000 and TAM activities become “business as usual” over time, it is anticipated that changes
to the current resources may arise.

The AMD staff possess a wealth of asset management expertise, as a number of its employees
transferred from other areas of the agency, bringing with them significant knowledge of agency
operations, experience in maintenance of many asset classes, physical asset business analysis, and/or

Transit Asset Management Plan 2021

1.B.4.b

TAM Activities
The resourcing strategy for the TAM activities is not only to define an accountable executive for all
TAM requirements but to assign TAM responsibilities to the AMD. Supporting resources from other
RTD departments will be utilized and consulted or informed on an as-needed basis. Details of both
the accountable executive and the AMD are in Appendix F.

6 Evaluation Plan
6.1

TAM Plan Evaluation

The TAM Plan will be evaluated on degree of compliance when RTD receives each triennial audit.
However, the plan is intended to do more than meet compliance. It is a statement of intentions and
commitment to deliver the culture, policy, and procedural changes necessary for the improved
efficacy and efficiency of transit agencies that is implied in the regulations.
This TAM Plan provides a baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans produced by the agency. RTD
intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting maturity targets in its Strategic
Asset Management Plan. This document will also serve as a basis of comparison to peer agencies,
allowing RTD to learn from other TAM Plans to identify where improvements can be made.
RTD will annually evaluate its performance against the previous cycle’s TAM Plan improvement goals
and agency objectives with documentation and explanation of progress (Regional Transportation
District, 2021). The RTD agency objectives are in Appendix G.

6.2

ISO 55000 Performance Evaluation and Improvement

RTD has committed to achieving certification to the asset management standard ISO 55000. This
requires the implementation of a management system for assets, based on Plan-Do-Check-Act
principles with specific elements for performance evaluation and improvement. These are still in
development in RTD and will be described in a future update.

6.3

ISO 55000 Certification Evaluation

RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements for ISO 55000, and
therefore its readiness for an ISO 55001 certification audit, through the following measures:
1. ISO spot checks – regular detailed reviews of specific elements of the emerging Asset
Management System to identify risks to certification, and implement corrective measures
2. ISO health check – mid-point review of the entire RTD Asset Management System against the
requirements of ISO 55000
3. ISO mock audit – prior to the ISO audit, RTD intends to conduct a “mock audit” to evaluate its
readiness for an actual ISO audit. Results from the mock audit will be used to determine the
appropriate time for the actual audit, along with any gaps that still exist

Accountable Executive – A single, identifiable person who has ultimate responsibility for
carrying out the safety management system of a public transportation agency; responsibility
for carrying out transit asset management practices; and control or direction over the human
and capital resources needed to develop and maintain both the agency's public
transportation agency safety plan, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), and the agency's
transit asset management plan in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5326.
Asset Information Maturity (AIM) – This consists of a framework, an assessment, AIM plans,
and updates to the Asset Management Accountability Team on progress towards stated
objectives in plans. The framework that includes a six-stage model indicating relative maturity
that are mutually exclusive based on the availability of information, the quality of data in its
utility for decision-making/planning, the presence or absence of a documented
plan/procedure for the development and utilization of data suitable for decisionmaking/planning, whether or not documented plans/procedures are followed and monitored
for adherence, and whether a ‘plan-do-check-act’ cycle of continuous improvement is applied
to tune information and plan quality to achieve organization objectives. The inventory
consists of 24 items based on ISO 55000 clauses 7.5 and 7.6 regarding information and its
control. The plans are signed documents available on the RTD intranet.
Backlog – State of Good Repair backlog is representative of the reinvestment cost to replace
any transit assets whose condition is below the midpoint on TERM’s 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)
scale, or 2.5.
Base System – Base System refers to RTD’s assets not included in the FasTracks system. The
base system is supported in part by a 0.6% sales and use tax. funded by a 0.6% sales tax prior
to the passage of the FasTracks ballot initiative. Base System funding and FasTracks funding
are tracked separately.
Capital Responsibility – Transit agencies are required to report condition assessments for
assets that they own or jointly own with another entity, that they are responsible for
replacing, overhauling, refurbishing, or conducting major repairs on that asset, or for which
the cost of those activities are itemized as a capital line item in the agency's budget.
CDOT – Colorado Department of Transportation.
Consist – A set of railroad vehicles forming a complete train.
Contracted Service – A contract for services is a formal, legally binding agreement between
RTD and a private company to provide service delivery.
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) – Denver’s metropolitan planning
organization (MPO). https://drcog.org/
Direct operated and purchased services – Direct operated services are those services
provided by RTD staff using RTD assets. Purchased Services are those operated under
contract on behalf of RTD using outside staffing. See also Contracted Service.
Estimated Useful Life (EUL) – The Estimated Useful Life indicates the expected duration in
years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating conditions and
maintenance. This metric is agency-defined as opposed to FTA established Useful Life
Benchmarks. At the end of useful life of the asset, major renewal or replacement is expected.

expansion of the RTD system. FasTracks introduced commuter rail service as well as a Public
Private Partnership (P3) to the system.
ISO 55000 – The international standard covering management of assets of any kind. Prior to
the establishment of this standard, a Publicly Available Specification (BSI PAS-55) was
published by the British Standards Institution in 2004 for physical assets. The ISO 55000
series of Asset Management standards was formalized in 2014 and is composed of three
parts:
o ISO 55000:2014 Asset management – Overview, Principles and Terminology
o ISO 55001:2014 Asset management – Management Systems – Requirements
o ISO 55002:2014 Guidelines for the Application of ISO 55001
MAP-21 – MAP-21, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 112-141) was
signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.
Mid-Term Financial Plan or MTFP – A portion of RTD’s total budget not already committed to
specific capital projects and not apportioned to ongoing operations and maintenance that is
evaluated and prioritized through a process described in Section 3 of this document.
National Transit Database – A federal reporting program for transit agencies receiving
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding, which serves as a primary repository for all
transit-related data and statistics in the United States. The performance data from the NTD is
used to allocate FTA funding and to report on public transit performance to Congress and
researchers.
Senior Leadership Team (SLT) – The group of Chiefs and Assistant General Managers that
report to the General Manager and CEO. This group is equivalent to the C-Suite in a private
organization.
State of Good Repair – “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at a full level
of performance.” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016)
TERM – Transit Economic Requirements model is a tool used by the FTA along with a numeric
code that represents the categorization of assets, as indicated in the TERM-Lite model.
Useful Life Benchmark (ULB) – The Useful Life Benchmark indicates the expected duration in
years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating conditions and
maintenance. This metric is established by the FTA as opposed to the agency-defined
Estimated Useful Life metric. At the end of useful life of the asset, major renewal or
replacement is expected.

RTD follows the FTA guidance on condition ratings. This rating is based on how close an asset or
component is to replacement or major overhaul. Scores will not have a greater granularity than a half
point.
An asset is in a State of Good Repair if the score is greater than (2.5). Refer to individual asset group
Inspection Standards Documents for confidence in reliability and specific examples.

Confidence in Reliability = Remaining Useful Life
5.0) New or like new, 95% to 100% confidence in reliability; no visible defects, no damage, cosmetically looks
new. An asset is only new once, after rebuild some old parts are not new and therefore the highest score after
rebuild is (4.5).
4.5) The inspector is 90% to <95% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
4.0) The inspector is 80% to <90% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Shows minimal signs of
wear, no major defects, and some minor defects with only minimal signs of deterioration.
Cosmetic defects/minor wear.
3.5) The inspector is 70% to <80% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
3.0) The inspector is 60% to <70% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Some moderately defective
or deteriorated components; expected maintenance needs. Cosmetically ‘fair’ but all devices are functioning as
designed.

Small repairs or minor refurbishment.
2.5) The inspector is 50% to <60% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
2.0) The inspector is 40% to <50% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Asset near overhaul or
retirement, but in serviceable condition. Asset has increasing number of defects or deteriorated component(s).

Significant or multiple repairs needed.
1.5) The inspector is 30% to <40% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
1.0) The inspector is less than 30% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Asset is in need of major
repair or refurbishment, multiple minor defects or major defects. Evidence of corrosion may be apparent; major
or numerous minor areas of damage or structural issues.
Safety concern, critical damage, close to or time for overhaul or replacement .

It is anticipated the following specific resources will be required for TAM activities for the duration of
the plan horizon:
•

•

•

Staff resources
o One accountable executive
o Fourteen FTEs from the Asset Management Division, who will split their time
between TAM and ISO 55000 implementation
o FTE requirements for other RTD resources necessary for TAM activities are not
defined in this generation of the TAM Plan
Technology resources: the technologies are used to support asset management across the
agency. RTD’s aim is to use the tools it already owns, rather than invest in new ones at this
time.
o Hardware and software necessary to support:
▪ Multiple source software systems – e.g. Trapeze EAM, Oracle EBS
▪ Data warehouse – provides aggregation and integration of data
▪ Analysis and reporting tools – Power BI, Access, Excel, SPSS and others
Financial resources
o Financial resources necessary to support asset management ‘business as usual’
activities, TAM and ISO implementation. Beyond these, RTD has not defined any
requirement for further resources for this generation of the TAM Plan.

1. Accountable Executive – a single position with ultimate accountability for Asset Management
and the Asset Management System within RTD.
2. Asset Management Accountability Team (AMAT) – this group has formal accountability
delegated from the Accountable Executive for the delivery, embedding, review and continual
improvement of the Asset Management System. The group is comprised of the Chief
Financial Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Chief Administration Officer, Assistant General
Manager for Capital Programs, Assistant General Manager for Asset Management, Security
and Safety, and Senior Manager of the Asset Management Division.
3. Asset Management Division – the AMD is responsible for the design, delivery, embedding,
review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System’s products, processes
and information, as well as preparing for and undertaking the ISO 55000 certification audit.
It is anticipated that the Asset Management Division will have the following roles and
responsibilities for ISO 55000 during the plan horizon is described in figure 33. The Asset
Management Senior Manager reports to the Chief Safety Officer, which is the Assistant
General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management.
4. Other RTD resources – as needed, other RTD resources will be utilized, consulted or informed
regarding the Asset Management System. This could include operations, maintenance,
finance, human resources, communications, IT, legal and procurement staff. The Asset
Management Accountability Team will allocate these resources directly when within their
reporting line or via a request to other members of the Senior Leadership Team when they
are not.
5. External resources – RTD will also utilize external expertise to develop the internal asset
management competencies of both the Asset Management Division and other RTD resources
involved with the Asset Management System. The alternative to this is to be continually
reliant on an external entity to supply expertise indefinitely. Selecting both an established
asset management framework and interactions with consultants, RTD intends to cultivate an
Asset Management Division capable of acting as an internal consulting service to the agency.
The intention is to ‘own the process, not the product’ as it relates to functions and
competencies that will become annual activities for the AMD. Additional external resources
will also be utilized to deliver aspects of the Asset Management System, specifically the
operations and maintenance of approximately half of the bus fleet.

Light Rail System Description

The RTD light rail system was designed as the first piece of a planned regional rapid transit system. In 1989, the Colorado
Supreme Court declared that the Denver metro area Regional Transportation District was eligible to collect a use tax that
enabled the District to accumulate funding of $67 million for construction of a rail system.
The project was approved by DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) in 1991. Construction on the initial 5.3-mile
rail system and a functional operations facility began without federal funding or an increase in local taxes in October 1992.
Safety Certification and Construction of the light rail system was completed by the end of September 1994, and the system
opened for revenue service with 11 light rail vehicles on October 7, 1994. Additional lines, facilities, and vehicles were added
in subsequent years with voter support, as detailed below.

I 5.1.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the light rail system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak (morning and evening commuter
times) and off-peak hours, weekends and weekdays, and special events. Light rail transit currently carries roughly 20,000
customers daily. Trains operate as one-, two-, three-, or four-car consists. Revenue service is generally available 21 hours
per day.
The Regional Transportation District’s objective is to operate the light rail transit system safely, reliably, and efficiently and
to integrate light rail operation with bus service for the greatest convenience to the public. This is the means by which the
integration of transportation services could assist the region in meeting clean air standards, alleviating traffic congestion,
and improving the overall quality of life of the area.
Light rail service operates on the existing 5.3-mile Central Corridor, the 8.7-mile Southwest Corridor, the 1.8-mile Central
Platte Valley Spur, the 19-mile Southeast Corridor, the 12.1-mile West Rail Corridor, the 10.5-mile I-225 Corridor, and the 1.6mile Southeast Rail Extension (SERE). The system has eight operating lines: C, D, E, F, H, L, W, and R.

I 5.1.2

Organizational Structure

The light rail transit safety specialist’s office is located at the Elati Light Rail Operations and Maintenance center. Thus, the
lines of communication between safety and light rail operations are effective. Key positions with light rail operations are:
●

Assistant General Manager, Rail

●

Senior Manager, Rail Operations, Planning & Systems

●

Business Program Manager

●

General Superintendent of Light Rail Transportation

●

Manager of Rail Service Delivery

●

Manager of LRV Operator Training

Light Rail Corridors

Central Corridor
Passenger service on the Central Corridor Light Rail system began October 7, 1994. The system is operated by Denver’s
Regional Transportation District as part of a fully integrated mass transit system, which includes local bus routes, express
bus routes, regional bus routes, shuttle bus routes, and demand-response service for disabled customers.
The Central Corridor comprises 5.3 miles of trackway with 13 stations, including three ark-n-rRde locations. The Central
Corridor operates at grade level except for one fly-over structure for grade separation at Kalamath and Santa Fe. An initial
fleet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) were procured for the operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service,
six additional LRVs were ordered.
The Central Corridor begins at I-25 and Broadway on the southwest end and terminates at 30th Avenue and Downing
Street. The corridor provides direct connections between the I-25 and Broadway Station transfer facility, Broadway
Marketplace, Auraria Campus, Colorado Convention Center, and the 16th Street Mall (Market Street, Civic Center, and Union
Station transit stations), Five Points, and many major hotels and businesses in between.
Major attractions within a short walking distance of the Central Corridor stations or the 16th Street Mall shuttles include the
Denver Center for the Performing Arts complex, federal courthouse, 17th Street Financial District, U.S. Mint, Tabor Center,
State Capitol, Denver Art Museum, Denver Public Library, History Colorado Center, Larimer Square, and Coors Field.
Light rail vehicles are operated manually. Automatic block wayside signals, traffic signals, radio communication, operational
procedures, and train orders govern operators regarding all vehicle movement. Appropriate street traffic signals, speed limit
signage, and wayside signals assist the operator in selecting proper movement sequence and speeds. City operations are
by line of sight. All city street crossings are governed by coordinating adjacent street intersection traffic signals, while the
at-grade crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are governed by gates with flashers and warning bells. The crossings at
13th Avenue and at Bayaud are jointly used and maintained by Union Pacific Railroad and RTD.
Station platforms are unattended and utilize automated fare equipment for ticket sales and ticket validation. Transit Security
Officers (TSO) monitor the proof of payment honor system. Roving rail supervisors, contracted security officers, and local
police departments provide platform security.
A 2.5-acre yard and the Light Rail Mariposa Facility is located adjacent to the Southern Pacific Railroad switching yard near
6th Avenue at 655 Mariposa Street. Powered switches on the double track mainline provide access to and from yard leads
at either end of the storage yard, allowing access from ladder tracks into the shop. The Light Rail Mariposa Facility includes
a yard for vehicle storage and a maintenance facility for vehicle maintenance and system support maintenance. Central
Control is located on the second floor of the facility and is the operational governing authority for all mainline vehicle
movement. Central Control personnel (controller/supervisors) direct, control, and monitor revenue-service operations
using radio, telephone, and public address communications. Mainline operations are controlled by a schedule timetable
and directed by Central Control in accordance with established operating schedules, rules, and procedures. Controllers
implement all corrective actions necessary to maintain service schedules and to minimize adverse impacts of equipment
failures, emergency situations, or weather-related problems. In addition, some unit repair, facility maintenance, and nonrevenue maintenance occurs at RTD’s District Shops location.
The corridor begins on the south end with I-25 and Broadway Station. I-25 and Broadway station provides a major bus and
light rail transfer point and is a junction for the Southwest, Southeast and Central corridors. From Broadway proceeding
north a short distance is Alameda Station. After leaving Alameda Station, trains pass through Bayaud crossing and then
ascend the Santa Fe/Kalamath flyover structure, returning to grade as the alignment passes the Mariposa facility before
entering 10th and Osage Station. From 10th and Osage, trains pass through the 13th Avenue crossing and then either travel
downtown (Central Corridor) or to the Central Platte Valley (CPV) Corridor. Continuing northeast on the Central Corridor
is Colfax at Auraria Station, which allows direct access to the Auraria Campus via a plaza and a bus transfer point. After

leaving Colfax at Auraria Station, the double track alignment proceeds across Kalamath Street and Speer Boulevard,
crossing a bridge structure over Cherry Creek along Stout Street to Convention Center Station near 14th and Stout streets.
At 14th Street, the inbound track turns east and then north to travel along California Street. The outbound track runs along
Stout Street between 14th and 19th streets. Two passenger stations are located on Stout, one at 16th Street and one at
18th Street. The inbound track along California Street travels in an automobile traffic contra-flow direction from 14th to 19th
streets, servicing the 16th Street and California passenger station located on the 16th Street Mall, then continuing on the
single track northeast bound to the next passenger station, at 18th Street on California.
The alignment turns southeast on 19th Street, where it joins the track to Welton Street and where the double track travels
east on Welton Street to the 20th Street and Welton Station, located between 19th and 20th streets on Welton. The double
track alignment continues as it crosses over to the south side of Welton near 20th Street to 24th Street. Between 24th
and 25th streets, the double track configuration transitions into single track. The single-track alignment is retained as it
continues northeast on Welton and proceeds to the 25th Street and Welton Station, located near 26th Street. Traveling
northeast along the alignment, the trackway approaches the 27th Street mini station located between 27th and 28th streets,
then transitions back into a double track configuration as it enters the 30th Aand Downing northern terminus station.

Southwest Corridor
The Southwest Corridor opened for revenue service in July 2000. It is an 8.7-mile extension of the Central Corridor light
rail system from I-25 and Broadway in Denver to the end-of-line station at Mineral Avenue and Santa Fe Drive in Littleton. It
includes five light rail stations: Evans, Englewood, Oxford•City of Sheridan, Littleton•Downtown, and Littleton•Mineral. Each
station location has an associated Park-n-Ride, with the exception of Oxford.
The Southwest Corridor is a double track alignment operating in high-speed territory at a maximum speed of 55 mph. The
corridor consists of mixed-use operations including three freight railroad mainline tracks, two light rail tracks, and Santa
Fe Drive on the west side of the corridor. The entire corridor is grade-separated with the exception of a pedestrian-freight
spur crossing at the Evans station. Traditional active grade crossing equipment and signals including warning bells, lights,
and gates control this crossing. The light rail tracks parallel the freight mainline tracks throughout the corridor. To enhance
patron use, the light rail corridor resides on the east side of the freight rail corridor from I-25 and Broadway to Tufts Avenue,
and on the west side of the freight corridor from Tufts Avenue to Mineral Avenue. Two flyover structures accommodate
grade separation between freight railroad and light rail tracks: one near Tufts Avenue, where the east/west transition
occurs; and one near Iowa, where the light rail tracks cross the Iowa freight spur track.
Leaving the I-25 and Broadway station southbound, the tracks cross over Mississippi Avenue on a bridge and continue
south to cross over Iowa Ave on another bridge. Shortly after crossing Iowa Avenue, the alignment rises on the Iowa flyover
structure to pass over a freight rail spur track coming from the mainline on the west side of the light rail tracks. Once the
trackway returns to grade, the tracks pass under Evans Avenue and enter the Evans station. Continuing south from Evans
station, the mainline right of way passes the Elati Operations Facility and yard before crossing a bridge over Dartmouth
Avenue and into Englewood Station. Trains leave Englewood Station southbound and cross the bridge over Hampden
Avenue and continue to Oxford Station. From Oxford Station south, the alignment passes over Oxford Avenue and then
climbs the Tufts flyover structure that transitions light rail from the east side of the freight track mainline to the west side.
Descending off the flyover, the alignment passes over Belleview Avenue on a bridge before entering a below grade cut and
Littleton•Downtown Station. Continuing south from the station, the track climbs from the cut to grade and continues to the
end-of-line Littleton•Mineral Station.
An additional 14 light rail vehicles were added to the existing fleet to accommodate the extension. The light rail vehicles
are Siemens Duewag SD100 and SD160 models, the same used for the Central Corridor. The Mariposa maintenance facility
was expanded to accommodate the fleet size increase. All operational characteristics for the Southwest Corridor are similar
to the existing operational characteristics of the Central Corridor. Since service origination of the Southwest Corridor, 18
additional SD 100s have been placed into revenue service.

Central Platte Valley Spur
The Central Platte Valley (CPV) Spur is approximately 1.8 miles in length, linking the existing Central Corridor light rail line at
Colfax Avenue to Denver Union Station. This is a double track alignment along the entire corridor, including the CPV junction.
The CPV Spur begins at approximately Colfax Avenue and Rio Court (the location where the existing Central Corridor light
rail lines curves to the east under the Colfax Avenue viaduct). The alignment generally follows Curtis Street from Colfax
Avenue to west of 5th Street, on the western edge of the Auraria Campus. At this point, the alignment turns north and
parallels 5th Street and enters Auraria West Station. From there, the alignment crosses Walnut Street and enters Empower
Field at Mile High Station. From there the alignment parallels the Consolidated Mainline (freight), to the Ball Arena•Elitch
Gardens Station, then continues north and ends at Denver Union Station. Stations are located at the new administration
building of the Auraria Campus (Auraria West); near the existing “Sports Walk” that serves Empower Field at Mile High
Station near the stadium; at the pedestrian bridge serving Ball Arena and Elitch Gardens; and Denver Union Station.
The alignment has two at-grade crossings: 5th Street and Walnut Street, which include active warning devices for control
and safety considerations to mitigate impacts to traffic and pedestrians in these areas.
During major events, such as professional sports games and concerts at Ball Arena, Coors Field and Empower Field at Mile
High, special service will be provided with trains running as frequently as every four to five minutes between the event
venue and the Southwest and Southeast Corridors. Some of these special event trains may terminate at the I- 25/Broadway
station while other will continue to the Littleton•Mineral and RidgeGate Parkway end-of-line stations.

Southeast Corridor
The Southeast Corridor began revenue service in November 2006. It consists of 21 miles of double-tracked light rail
transit, beginning at the existing Broadway station and ending at RidgeGate Parkway Station. This includes an alignment
along I-225 in the median, from I-25 to Nine Mile Station at Parker Road. There are 16 stations: Louisiana•Pearl; University;
Colorado; Yale; Southmoor; Belleview; Orchard; Arapahoe at Village Center; Dry Creek; County Line; Lincoln; Sky Ridge;
Lone Tree City Center; RidgeGate Parkway; Dayton; and Nine Mile. All facilities, including RTD trains, stations, pedestrian
and bicycle facilities, and other design elements, are in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
With the Southeast Corridor expansion, the Elati Light Rail Operations facility and yard were constructed at 2701 S. Elati
St. This was a necessity to accommodate the more than doubling of light rail vehicles and associated support needs that
accompanied the system expansion. North and south yard leads were cut into the existing Southwest corridor mainline
track just north of Dartmouth on the south and a short distance south of Evans station on the north. In January of 2006, the
Elati facility became the new operations center and the Mariposa facility became a heavy maintenance and repair shop,
while still maintaining the Control Center on the second floor.
The Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) opened for revenue service in May 2019. This extended double track rail service 1.6
miles from the former end-of-line station at Lincoln to the new end-of-line station at RidgeGate Parkway. Two additional
stations, Sky Ridge and Lone Tree City Center, are located on the extension.

Broadway to Colorado
The Southeast Corridor alignment begins with a wye connection south of the existing Broadway station, allowing vehicles
from the Southeast Corridor to access both the Southwest Corridor and existing light rail line to central downtown.
Following the wye tracks, the alignment rises above grade to pass over Broadway on an aerial structure. After crossing
Broadway, the alignment turns to the south along the southbound I-25 on-ramp and drops down to match the grade of I-25
and into Louisiana•Pearl station. This allows the LRT alignment to pass under the cross streets, maintaining a 17-foot vertical
clearance above the top of rail. Through the Narrows (Broadway to University), the alignment parallels I-25 between I-25’s
collector distributor road and Buchtel Boulevard. The tracks generally pass behind the abutment of the highway bridges
through a separate light rail bridge structure and enter University Station.

1.B.4.b

Packet Pg. 241

At the University interchange, the alignment moves away from I-25, runs along the outside edge of the University off-ramp,
and rises up to pass over University on the aerial structure. After crossing University, the alignment continues along the
outside edge of the University on-ramp, returning to an alignment adjacent to the I-25 shoulder and at the same grade as
the highway.

Colorado to Evans
At Colorado, the alignment follows the Colorado Boulevard off-ramp and travels under Colorado Boulevard in a short tunnel
section. After passing under Colorado, the alignment remains below grade in an open trench section, enters Colorado
Station and again parallels I-25. After leaving the station, it passes under Evans in a tunnel section.

Evans to Union
After passing under Evans, the alignment rises to return to the highway grade, running adjacent to the highway into Yale
Station. At Yale Avenue, the alignment runs along the edge of the Yale ramps and passes over Yale on an aerial structure.
South of Yale, the alignment follows along the west side of I-25 to Hampden Avenue. At Hampden, the alignment
enters a very short tunnel section under Hampden, returns to the I-25 grade on the south side of Hampden, and enters
Southmoor Station.
Continuing south, the alignment passes under Quincy and then travels along the western edge of the I-25/I-225 freeway
interchange. Special track work at this location allows for a wye connection to the light rail alignment located along I-225.
These connecting tracks are primarily at-grade and pass below the I-25/I-225 interchange.

Union to Arapahoe Road
Proceeding south from the I-225 wye connection, the alignment passes under Union Avenue along the west edge of I-25.
After passing under Union Avenue, the alignment continues south into Belleview Station. After leaving the station, it travels
along the ramps and over Belleview on an aerial structure. Continuing south from Belleview, the alignment runs adjacent to
I-25 to Orchard Station, where it again shifts out along the ramps and then over Orchard Road on an aerial structure. South
of Orchard, the alignment returns to the west edge of the highway into Arapahoe at Village Center Station. From the station
continuing south, the alignment rises to pass over the three west side ramps and Arapahoe Road on a long aerial structure.

Arapahoe Road to RidgeGate Parkway
South of Arapahoe Road, the alignment continues adjacent to the I-25 shoulder to Dry Creek Station. From Dry Creek
Station, the alignment travels adjacent to the ramps and over Dry Creek on an aerial structure. After passing Dry Creek,
the alignment returns to the I-25 shoulder to County Line Road, where it rises up to pass over two ramps and County Line
Road on an aerial structure. After passing County Line Road and the ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange, the
alignment runs along the west edge of I-25 into County Line Station. South of the station, the alignment enters the C-470/
E470 interchange.
Through the C-470/E470 interchange, the alignment travels under the ramps in short tunnels and over C-470, around the
western side of the interchange ramps and then adjacent to I-25, where it continues south into Lincoln Station. After leaving
Lincoln Station, the alignment continues south and passes over Lincoln Avenue on an aerial structure and then turns east
into Sky Ridge Station. The lone at grade crossing on the Southeast Corridor, Trainstation Circle crossing, is at the south
end of Sky Ridge Station. The alignment then crosses over I-25 on an aerial structure and turns south into Lone Tree City
Center Station. From the station, it continues over RidgeGate Parkway on an aerial structure and into the end-of line-station.

1.B.4.b

I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road
The alignment along I-225 begins at the I-25/I-225 interchange, where it connects to the I-25 alignment through a wye
connection, allowing light rail vehicles to connect to both the northbound and southbound lines on the I-25 alignment. After
the wye connection, the alignment travels in the I-225 median at the highway grade. The alignment continues in the I-225
median into Dayton Station. From Dayton Station, the alignment continues east into Nine Mile Station at Parker Road.
Packet Pg. 242

The corridor operates with similar characteristics as existing corridors, including traction power substations and signal
systems. A SCADA system is included in the Southeast Corridor project and is retrofitted into the existing system.
Additionally, an automatic trip stop system was added to stop trains if they bypass a red signal.

West Corridor
The West Rail Line is a 12.1-mile light rail transit corridor that began revenue service in April 2013, extending from Denver
Union Station to the Jefferson County Government Center. The alignment runs through Denver, Lakewood, and Golden.
The West Rail Line has 12 stations: Auraria West, Decatur•Federal, Knox, Perry, Sheridan, Lamar, Lakewood•Wadsworth,
Garrison, Oak, Federal Center, Red Rocks College, and Jefferson County Government Center•Golden.
The alignment is double track from Denver Union Station to Federal Center Station and is single track from Federal Center
Station to the Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station. Total travel time from Denver Union Stationto Jefferson
County Government Center•Golden is 35 minutes. The corridor operates similarly to existing RTD light rail corridors.
Starting from Denver Union Station, the alignment travels to the Ball Arena•Elitch Gardens Station, Empower Field at Mile
High Station, and Auraria West Station.
Departing from the Auraria West Station, the alignment passes through the Central Corridor and CPV junction and curves
south under Colfax Avenue, where it crosses over the Consolidated Main Line (CML) on an aerial structure. The alignment
turns to the west on this structure before returning to grade and passing under I-25. From the I-25 viaduct, it continues west
through the Zuni Street at grade crossing and over the South Platte River on a bridge structure. After it crosses the river, it
passes through the Decatur Street at grade crossing and into Decatur•Federal Station.
From Decatur•Federal Station, the train continues west on the alignment under the Federal Bridge, following Lakewood
Gulch through the Knox Court crossing into Knox Station. Leaving Knox Station, the alignment curves south towards 10th
Avenue, following Dry Gulch and continuing west to the Perry Street crossing and Perry Station. The alignment continues
west through a gated crossing for the bike path at Wolff Street and into Sheridan Station under Sheridan Boulevard.
Departing Sheridan Station, the alignment curves north to run alongside 13th Avenue and west through Harlan crossing into
Lamar Station. Traveling west through the Lamar, Pierce, and Teller crossings, the track then ascends an aerial structure into
the next station, Lakewood•Wadsworth. Leaving Wadsworth station and descending the bridge, the alignment continues
west through Carr Street and Estes Street crossings and into Garrison Station.
Continuing west, the alignment passes through Garrison Street and Independence Street crossings, passes over the Kipling
Street Bridge, then proceeds through the Oak Street crossing into Oak Station.
From Oak Station, the alignment curves south at Quail Street and Collins Avenue crossings and follows Simms Street to the
8th Avenue crossing before passing over 6th Avenue on the 6th Avenue Bridge. It then continues south through the North
Avenue crossing and turns west into Federal Center Station. Some trains turn back here to return to Denver Union Station,
utilizing the pocket track, while others continue to the Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station.
Departing Federal Center Station and continuing to Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station, the alignment
curves north and becomes single track prior to passing through the 4th Avenue crossing. The alignment continues to 6th
Avenue, turns west and proceeds through the Union Boulevard tunnel, and continues west along the south side of 6th
Avenue into the Red Rocks College Station, where it splits into double track.
Departing Red Rocks College Station, the alignment becomes single track again and continues west along 6th Avenue. The
alignment curves north and then back west as it crosses the Indiana Street Bridge flyover to the north side of 6th Avenue,
where the alignment continues. It goes through the tunnel under I-70, passes over Colfax on an aerial structure, then
proceeds through the Ulysses Street and Earl Johnson Road crossings before entering one of three tracks at the end-of-line
station, Jefferson County Government Center•Golden.

I-225 Rail Corridor
The I-225 project added 10.5 miles to the light rail system within the city of Aurora, providing key regional connections to
the East and Southeast rail lines. Construction on the full line began in 2013. This light rail line opened for service to the
public in February 2017 as the R Line, and it features eight stations: , Florida, Iliff, Aurora Metro Center, 2nd Ave•Abilene,
13th Ave, Colfax, Fitzsimons, and Peoria. This corridor extends light rail service north from Nine Mile Station to Peoria
Station, where customers can connect to commuter rail to access Denver International Airport.

I 5.1.4

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

The RTD Light Rail System includes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The SCADA system
provides two types of general functions: control over certain system elements from the Central Control Center, and system
monitoring and status information to the Central Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain
capabilities such as remote control to power down sections of the alignment and control over power track switches. It also
provides information to light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light rail system and train information.
SCADA information includes train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal status, and a variety of additional
system information.

I 5.1.5

Light Rail Vehicles

The RTD light rail vehicle fleet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD 160. The vehicles are very
similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC propulsion system and sliding plug doors, whereas the
SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. An initial fleet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) was procured for the
operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service, six additional LRVs were ordered. As ridership grew, so
did the system beyond the Central Corridor, triggering orders of new LRVs. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle,
and there are 49 of these vehicles in the fleet. The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68
were delivered, with an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks, the first of which arrived in August 2009. An additional
29 SD 160 vehicles were ordered in July 2018. RTD now has a total fleet of 201 vehicles. The LRVs are 6-axle, singlearticulated, double-ended, bidirectional, high-floor vehicles. They are approximately 80 feet in length, 8 feet and 9 inches
in width, and 13 feet high, and they operate on a standard railroad track gauge of 4 feet and 8 ½ inches. They are powered
by 750 volts of direct current from an overhead wire and capable of speeds up to 55 mph. Each vehicle can seat 48 to
56 passengers and accommodate up to 61 additional standing passengers at normal loads. Additional standees may be
accommodated at a crush load capacity. Exhibits shows the vehicle layout and critical exterior measurements to maximize
the level of comfort with which customers are afforded for their trip. In addition, light rail vehicles are equipped with HVAC

I 5.1.6

Operations

The Operations Control Center, which underwent a major remodel to accommodate the system expansion and SCADA,
governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains contact with the train operators by
means of a radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail operators also carry a portable radio to be used in case
they have to leave the cab or there is a radio failure. Controllers/supervisors rove throughout the system during operations.
Their role is to provide support and coordination between Central Control and light rail vehicle operators during an
emergency or upset in the system that may require a manual block operation, bus bridge, evacuation, or accident
response and investigation.

BUS OPERATIONS SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The Regional Transportation District was created by an act of the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 and became an
operating unit on July 1 of that year. The purpose of creating this agency was to provide a regional approach to public
transportation.

Packet Pg. 245

On January 1, 1974, RTD began collecting a half percent sales tax and became fully operational. RTD initially inherited 321
buses from Denver Metro Transit.
Many of these vehicles were over 20 years old. Total bus mileage was 9 million miles per year, with fewer than 20 million
customers annually.
Only one maintenance and storage facility existed for buses. There was little or no maintenance capacity for buses in the
small system operating in the District. These systems served several local areas and there was a private Denver-Boulder
bus line.
RTD began building a modern bus fleet and its needed support facilities. In 1975, the six fragmented bus systems that had
provided service to different areas of the District were integrated into a single, unified system. New and improved service
became the focal points for future growth.
The improved service included the extension of routes; new local and express routes; more frequent service; new nighttime
service on many routes; increased service to the mountain areas of the District; exclusive bus lanes; and the inauguration
of special service for the elderly and disabled. Meeting special needs made RTD the first transit system in the nation with a
comprehensive bus program to serve the needs of the elderly and disabled. All of these factors led to a significant increase
in ridership.
To support and encourage new customers, RTD also launched a program to establish Park-n-Ride facilities. Additional bus
maintenance and storage facilities were acquired to accommodate the growing bus fleet.
The 16th Street Mall bus service became operational in 1982. This was the first step in a unique transit concept, which
would pull 50 percent of the buses off downtown streets during peak hours and provide opportunities for additional
suburban service.
In 1994, RTD partnered with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to add High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)
lanes from I-25 to US 36, allowing regional and express routes running along US 36 and I-25 to downtown Denver to
bypass congestion around the Turnpike Tangle.
In 2016, RTD began operating the Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service along US 36 and the I-25 HOV lanes,
seamlessly connecting Boulder and Denver. Later that year, RTD began operation of 36 BYD K10MR all-electric buses on
the 16th Street Mall, making it one of the largest electric bus fleets in the nation. The District has evolved into a transit
system that has a service area of 2,342 square miles. It serves 40 municipalities in all or part of eight counties. The system
comprises 148 routes. The fleet currently has 1,011 buses, of which 434 are leased to private carriers. There are currently
four maintenance and storage facilities Districtwide, 77 Park-n-Rides, and six transfer stations.

I 5.3.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the fixed route bus transit system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak and off-peak
hours, weekends, weekdays, and special events. The bus system transports an average of 200,827 weekday boardings.
Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station are the main transfer stations in the downtown Denver area.

I 5.3.2 Organizational Structure

general superintendent of bus transportation, , general superintendent of bus maintenance, and general superintendent of
street supervision, Manager of contracted service, and business program manager. All of these key positions have regular
contact with the bus transit safety specialist.
Packet Pg. 246

I 5.3.3 Bus Transportation Operations
Dispatch governs the operation, control, and dispatch of buses and other RTD vehicles. Dispatch maintains control with
bus operators by means of two-way radios, standard telephones, and Global Positioning System (GPS). Street Supervisors
also carry portable radios in the event of a system failure. Street Supervisors rove throughout the system during operations.
Their role is to provide support and coordination between dispatch and bus operators during an emergency, accident
response and investigation, rerouting, or other bus-related issues.
Bus transportation Operations is responsible for providing safe, reliable, and efficient service to all areas served by our
mass transit system. This is accomplished by scheduling bus service from three operating divisions with732 full-time and 93
part time bus operators. Service is provided seven days a week over approximately 21 hours of each day.
Street supervisors monitor service and performance of bus operators to ensure the safe, efficient, on-time delivery of
scheduled bus service. The district also provides continuous evaluation of routes, schedules, bus stops, shelters, and
facilities to determine the effectiveness and condition of service and amenities.
Effective, two-way radio communication is provided to all revenue and non-revenue vehicles. Information is received and
relayed to the proper sources to provide assistance and coordination for bus operations. Communication is provided
through the radio system, telephones, and a state-of-the-art tracking system.
The District also monitors bus service provided by private contractors, which operate approximately 58% of RTD’s fixed
route service. Assistance is provided to customers at transit centers, transfer stations, and customer care. The District also
coordinates special community events planning. In the event of a transit emergency, Dispatchers and street supervisors will
coordinate bus activities.

I 5.3.4 Standard Operating Procedures and Employee Rule Book
Bus operations are strictly governed by policies and procedures outlined in the Trailblazer. Standard rules of conduct and
procedure are necessary. The rules outlined in this document have been adopted for the requirements of RTD’s operations
and are considered necessary for rendering a quality level of service to customers. The Trailblazer is a comprehensive
manual with procedures and guidelines for every aspect of bus operations, including the performance code; passenger
relations and interaction; ADA requirements; personnel practices; operating procedures; emergency and legal procedures;
equipment care and operation; personal appearance; radio procedures; fares, transfers, and passes; operation procedures;
