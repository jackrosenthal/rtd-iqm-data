IV. FTA Submission for Approval
•

20.3% Overall DBE Goal
10.3% Race Conscious (the use of contract goals)
10% Race Neutral
Race Neutral means: There are many projects where the Primes’ commitments exceed the DBE
contract goals as well as there are several contracts where DBEs are primes on projects with RTD.
Examples of some of projects where DBE are primes include: On-Call Materials Testing, 15L Route
Improvements Construction Project, Construction Management Services, Information
Technology, etc.

•

RTD Triennial DBE Goal and Methodology for FFY 2020-2022 is due to the FTA
