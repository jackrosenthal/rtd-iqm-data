PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Service Standards
Service standards are criteria used to define the qualities, characteristics, and service levels provided by
a public transit agency. Such standards include a wide range of elements such as reliability, frequency,
loading, geometric design, stop spacing, coverage, accessibility, land use, supplemental service, and
overall customer experience while using transit. These standards are used to measure service
performance, to guide decision-making when planning and delivering services, and to determine resource
needs.
RTD routinely monitors and adjusts service delivery to accommodate the transit needs of customers and
jurisdictions within the agency’s service area. The agency adheres to and periodically updates service
standards to maintain consistency in the evaluation of existing services and modifications thereto based
on system performance and utilization, with a lens toward maintaining service equity; to examine
opportunities for new service offerings; and to ensure that the services delivered represent the most
cost-effective use of the agency’s resources in fulfilling RTD’s mission of making lives better through
connections.
RTD’s inaugural service standards, which provided a rational, equitable, and sustainable approach to
developing and evaluating service delivery, were originally adopted in 1987 and have been revised
periodically over the intervening years. The Board most recently approved the agency’s service standards

Packet Pg. 3

1.E.1

in 2016, which also stipulated that standards will be revised and approved every two years thereafter. A
subsequent refresh of the service standards was postponed due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
in 2020. As staffing resources continue to grow, boardings continue to rebound over time, and service
is adjusted to meet the needs of the customers and communities served, the Board and staff anticipate
the need to resume a collective discussion surrounding the revision and adoption of service standards in
2026 and on a routine basis thereafter.
Comprehensive Operational Analysis/System Optimization Plan
RTD’s current Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA), branded as the System Optimization Plan or
SOP, is a detailed evaluation of travel patterns, demographics, and transit routes in within RTD’s service
area and includes recommended modifications to the agency’s fixed-route services to better meet the
region’s near-term mobility needs within existing workforce and financial constraints. It is best practice
in the transit industry to use a COA to inform service standards.
The SOP was developed over the course of two years and followed a five-step process to inform
decisions and recommendations, including a comprehensive assessment of existing services, review of
current travel patterns and financial capacity, identification and discussion of goals and values, and
iterative drafting of recommended network improvements. The SOP, formally adopted by the RTD Board
of Directors in July 2022, will be gradually implemented through 2026 through RTD’s standard service
change process.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this Recommended Action, the Board establishes, in alignment with the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan, that:
•

•

•

No later than July 2025:
o Staff will provide a report to the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee related
outlining the current standards along with service performance data related to the
standards and will publish this information in an easily accessible location on the agency’s
website.
o The Board will review, ratify, and reaffirm the current service standards, most recently
approved by the Board in July 2016, and any administrative or ministerial changes that
have been made to the standards since 2016.
Staff will refresh, and the Board will consider, service standards at least triennially commencing in
July 2026 to coincide with the development of Comprehensive Operational Analyses on a
triennial or more frequent basis, as necessary to meet the needs of the agency.
Continuing in 2026 and in following years, staff will report to the Board on an annual basis, no
later than July each year, service performance data related to the service standards and will
publish this information and any updates thereto in an easily accessible location on the agency’s
website.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of Board policy guidance regarding service
standards. Funding to triennially perform COAs and to develop service standards related thereto will be
derived from the annual budgets for the year such COAs and standards are adopted.

1.E.1.c

1.1 Overview
RTD continually receives requests for changes to existing service and for new service in
growing areas of the District. Additionally, RTD may be operating some services that are
not attracting enough riders to justify their cost. In order to be consistent in the
evaluation of service proposals, and to ensure that the service being provided represents
the most cost-effective use of the District's resources, a set of service standards is
maintained by RTD.
The specific standards, targets or minimum/maximum values for the standards, and a
procedure for applying these standards, are presented in this document. Since service
standards are intended to optimize usage of the District's resources, they are updated
periodically to reflect changes in the District goals and resources. The procedure for
updating the standards is described in Section 1.3.

1.2 Application of Service Standards
There are two primary applications for the ongoing use of the service standards. These
are the use of standards to evaluate existing services, and use of standards to evaluate
proposals for new service.
The application of standards to existing routes is a flexible process. The purpose of the
standards is to help identify routes which are most in need of service changes, such as
restructuring to eliminate lower productivity segments or branches, adjusting service
frequency to better reflect the demand for service, or providing additional promotion of
less patronized routes where appropriate. Routes, which do not meet standards, are not
automatically designated for elimination. Elimination of routes is only intended as a last
resort, when it has been determined that no cost-effective actions are available to improve
the productivity of the route.
The standards for evaluation of existing routes are not intended to preclude changes to
routes that meet these minimum standards. In many cases, it may be possible to improve
the productivity of routes that meet the minimum standards by making changes to
headways or trip times. Since the overall mission of RTD is “To meet our constituents’
present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous,
accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District,” these standards should not
be used to prevent changes to improve the efficiency of existing routes, as long as the
changes meet the route design standards.
The availability of financial resources, represented by the annual budget, is the bottom line
for these standards. Service expansion may occur when additional funds are available and
contraction may occur otherwise. In any case, selection of which services to provide or
curtail is based on these performance standards and no service is considered guaranteed

1. Introduction

Service Development Policies & Standards

1.E.1.c

The evaluation of new service proposals will take place as proposals are received or needs
identified. The most recent values of the standards for existing routes will be used to
evaluate the proposed new services. Decisions regarding implementation of new routes
will be made through the service planning process. New routes and services will be
expected to meet all applicable design standards described in Sections 2, 3 and 54, but
will not be expected to meet the productivity standards described in Section 2.3.2.1 until
they have been in operation for at least six months. Demonstration, experimental, and
cost sharing services are also handled in this manner.

1.3 Updating of Service Standards
The service standards are intended to support the goals and objectives of the District.
Since these objectives and the resources available to attain them can be expected to
change over time, the standards will be revised periodically to reflect those changes.
The service standards will be reviewed on a bi-annual basis. At that time, experience
with the service standards over the previous time period, as well as changes in the
District's goals and objectives, will be used to determine whether any standards should be
added or revised.
The numerical values of productivity standards will be updated each year, using ridership,
revenue and cost figures for the most recent twelve-month period for which data are
available. The rankings are based only on those routes that existed for the entire year.
Routes which were eliminated during the year will not be included because they cannot be
identified as candidates for revisions. Routes that were introduced during the year will not
be included in determining the new standards since they are not required to meet the
productivity standards until they have been in operation for at least six months. However,
these routes will be evaluated separately, using the service standards contained in this
document.
The updating procedure will compare the values of the productivity standards with those
in effect for the previous year. Operating cost data for the previous year will be revised to
account for system-wide increases or decreases in operating cost.

2. Performance Standards
2.1

Derivation and Use of Standards

The productivity standards are used to identify routes and services for appropriate
marketing and possible revision or elimination. Separate standards are identified for each
class of service. Routes are evaluated on ridership (either boardings per in-service hour or
per trip, depending on the class of service) and on the economic measure of subsidy per
passenger. These standards are based on the performance of the least productive 10
percent of the routes in each service class for either the ridership or economic measure, or

Revised July 22, 2016

Packet Pg. 21

Attachment: Approved Service Standards_7-2016 (5089 : Service Planning Standards and Service Performance Reporting)

or beyond review. The RTD Board of Directors, with input from RTD staff and the public,
is responsible for making decisions on service recommendations.

Service Development Policies & Standards

on the least productive 25 percent of routes in both measures. The basis for the
standards will be reviewed in conjunction with the cost recovery standards in Section 9,
and may be revised if necessary.
New services should meet the applicable standards for their class of service after six
months of operation. All new services will be reviewed after six months of operation and
routes that have not shown adequate progress toward meeting the standards will be
targeted for cost-effective actions to increase productivity or for elimination.

To meet the RTD mission to provide cost-effective service throughout the District, RTD
has developed different types or classes of service that serve specific markets and,
therefore, have different performance expectations. Due to their different service
characteristics Express, Regional and SkyRide were treated as separate classes. However,
due to the deployment of rail, BRT and resulting service restructuring, these classes are
reconfigured. The routes in these three are reassigned into a new, consolidated Regional
class or the Local CBD class. Regional class includes routes providing high-speed service
on limited access highways from suburban and outlying communities to downtown
Denver, Denver International Airport and other metro, major employment centers, and
provided at distances of approximately 6 miles or more. Local services have three subclassifications: CBD—any route serving downtown Denver; Urban—35% or more of route
length within a ¼ mile buffer has population+employment density of 12 per acre or
greater; and Suburban—34% or less. Call-n-Ride and Access-a-Ride are separate classes.
Enhanced bus and BRT routes may warrant future consideration regarding their operation
with: dedicated right-of-way; partially dedicated ROW; limited or express mode; priority
over other traffic; and various speeds appropriate to context. [Please see attachment A
Service Classes for details on how these revisions affect current routes.]
The standards for evaluating portions of routes are intended for use in identifying needed
service improvements, for making modifications to specific portions of existing routes, or
for identifying low productivity segments of routes.
These standards could be used in situations such as isolating low productivity portions of
otherwise productive routes or measuring options for bringing unproductive routes into
compliance with the overall service standards. These standards may also be used to
evaluate proposals for new route extensions or deviations on existing routes.

2.2 Ridership and Economic Measures
The RTD’s approach is to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel
markets. All services are designed to match the level of service with demand, thus
improving performance and sustainability. This results in multiple domains of acceptable
performance for the various classes of service. Standards are best set by first determining
measures of performance and objectives. The core objective is to maximize overall
ridership, to the extent allowed by the available resources.

Service Development Policies & Standards

Service allocation is driven by the RTD adopted mission statement: “To meet our
constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible cost-effective service throughout the District.”
Performance Measures
• Passengers/hour (productivity)
• Passengers/trip (Regional class productivity)
• Subsidy/passenger (cost effectiveness)
The subsidy per passenger measure
combines fare revenue and total cost
impacts to produce a measure that
comprehensively reflects the District’s
allocation of resources. The effectivenessproductivity chart, Figure 1 - Effectiveness Productivity Chart, presents economic
effectiveness on the vertical axis, and
productivity, or boardings per hour, on the
horizontal axis.
The chart offers a
convenient comparative analysis of all
classes of services, illustrating both
absolute and relative performance. When
standards and guidelines are applied, Figure 1 Effectiveness - Productivity Chart
judgments can be made.

2.3 Fixed Route Service Design and Evaluation Standards
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
New routes shall provide the minimum frequencies specified below. Existing services that
cannot meet these minimum standards while adhering to the minimum passengers per
hour or trip standards defined in Section 2.3.2 shall be identified as candidates for service
changes or appropriate marketing promotion within available resources. These service
changes may include providing service with longer headways if no other viable alternative
exists. Elimination of the route may be considered if service changes and/or promotional
efforts do not improve productivity.
These are “policy” service levels and represent a compromise between economic
efficiency and the functionality of the system. To be sustained at these levels, a route
must meet the minimum ridership performance standards discussed in Section 2.3.2.1 and
annual calculated standards. Routes providing frequencies higher than the policy minimum
must be justified by ridership demand as outlined in Section 2.3.4.
The following table indicates the minimum frequency standard for types of service and
time of day by corridor (multiple routes sharing a segment).

2.3.2 Minimum Ridership Performance
This standard applies to routes operating at the minimum service frequency target. For
Local and Limited routes, the standard is passengers per hour based upon the bottom 10%
and 25% of routes in the respective class. For Regional, and SkyRide routes, the standard
is passengers per trip.
These standards are derived from system averages by class of service. All routes must
meet their applicable minimum standards. Those that do not meet these standards will
need to be modified or marketed in some way in order to bring them up to the minimum
standards. Those that are not brought up to the minimum standards are subject to
cancellation. Routes that meet their applicable minimum ridership standards justify a
service level at the minimum service frequencies outlined in Section 2.3.1. Higher
frequencies must be justified by ridership as outlined in Section 2.3.4.
2.3.2.1

Performance Standards

These measures and the effectiveness-productivity for all routes and services and the class
10% and 25% standards are calculated annually and are provided separately at
http://www.rtd-denver.com/ServiceDevelopment.shtml, under Service Development
Documents—Performance Reports.
2.3.2.2 Specific Trips Ridership Standards
The standard for evaluating specific trips on a route varies by time of day as shown in the
following table. For reference see the last column of Attachment C Regional Bus Service

Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard

From the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual: “From the passenger
perspective, the passenger load on a transit vehicle affects the comfort of the on-board
vehicle portion of a transit trip-both in terms of being able to find a seat and in overall
crowding levels within the vehicle. From a transit operator's perspective, a poor quality of
service may indicate the need to increase service frequency or vehicle size to reduce
crowding and increase passenger comfort.”
RTD defines crowding as a seated load plus the standing passenger space, as calculated
for each vehicle by subtracting the area occupied by seats and other objects from the
gross interior floor area. The amount of crowding on a route is defined as the percent of
total trips during a defined time period that exceed a comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3
square feet per standee, generally having these characteristics (See page 5-24 of the
Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, 3rd Edition,
http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_165ch-05.pdf):
• Standing load without body contact
• Standees have similar amount of personal space as seated passengers
• Reasonably easy circulation within vehicle
The maximum number of standees can be computed for each vehicle by determining its
standing passenger square footage and dividing by 4.3—5.3. For any service class during
any defined period (e.g., AM early, AM peak, midday), when 10% or more of the
directional trips exceed the computed maximum standees at the maximum load point,
further investigation of potential remedies, such as changing the bus assignment or
frequency of service, is warranted. For special events heavier loads are expected and
acceptable, but when 10% or more of trips during the take-away have 4 or less square
feet per standing passenger, further investigation of potential remedies is warranted. See
Attachment D Crowding Report Examples for reference. The Percent of Total Trips chart
(lower right) with level-of-service D or E would indicate crowding.

1.E.1.c

Service frequency in the RTD network is based on clock-pattern schedules. This pattern
provides consistent and easy to understand schedules for our customers, and makes
possible the provision of timed transfer connection hubs, whereby multiple routes are
scheduled to meet at one location to facilitate connections. In general, routes are
scheduled to operate in even increments of 30 minutes, or every 60, 30, 15, 10, 7.5, or 5
minutes. However, other frequencies may be provided depending upon passenger
demand, or operational and scheduling needs.
For routes meeting the above frequency, ridership, and load standards, frequency better
than every 30 minutes may be provided when and where justified by ridership. This
standard applies equally to all service categories. In order to be sustainable, higher
frequency service must meet the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•

Incremental frequency necessary to maintain the appropriate load standard during any
30 minute time period.
Appropriate vehicle assignment as outlined in Section 2.3.5
When a service exceeds the maximum load standard, higher frequency may be justified
during that time period and/or route segment.
If a service with better than the minimum frequency has passenger loads that can be
accommodated with a lower frequency without violating the load standard, then
frequency may be reduced.
As a general guideline, a typical productivity by service frequency, for a whole route or
a segment or time period is provided in Table 3 - Demand Based Service Frequency

2.3.4 Demand Based Service Frequency

Service Development Policies & Standards

1.E.1.c

The standards for evaluating portions of routes cover two areas in which minor
modifications may be made to routes without changing the overall structure of the route:
• midline segments or midline deviations
• branches or end segments
The governing standards for overall route productivity were presented earlier. Since trips
provided during marginally productive hours of the day or trips over marginal segments
often increase the attractiveness of the overall service, an otherwise productive route may
be able to support some less productive trips or portions of the route. However, if a route
cannot meet the overall service standards for its class of service, there may not be
productive segments to enhance the unproductive segments. Therefore, specific
segments, branches, or trips which meet the standards for portions of routes may still be
modified in order to raise the productivity of the entire route, if the overall route does not
meet the service standards for its class of service.
2.3.6.1 Midline Segments and Midline Deviations
•
•
•

A midline segment or deviation of a Local or Limited route should generate enough
boardings per hour of service provided to meet the standard for its class of service
(CBD, Urban and Suburban). Boardings in both directions will be counted.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause a reduction in the overall boardings
per hour for the route.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause the route to violate any route design
standards as defined in Section 2.3, or the overall productivity standards as defined in
Section 2.

2.3.6.2 Branches and End Segments
•
•
•

•

•

A branch or end segment of a Local or Limited route should generate enough boardings
to meet the ridership standard for its class of service (CBD, Urban and Suburban).
Boardings generated along the branch are defined as all passengers boarding the bus
along the branch or end portion of the route, and all outbound passengers alighting
along this section.
Local collector portions of Regional routes which meet the following maximum travel
time standard shall meet the ridership productivity standard for the entire route. This
maximum travel time is equal to 15 minutes or 50 percent of line haul travel time,
whichever is less.
For shorter segments, the minimum ridership standard is reduced by the ratio of actual
travel time to the maximum allowable travel time. Thus, if the actual travel time along
the collector is half of the maximum allowed, it must average half the number of
boardings per trip specified in the minimum ridership productivity standard.
A new extension to a route that does not meet the minimum ridership productivity
standard must attract sufficient ridership for the entire route to meet the minimum
ridership standard for its service class.

2.3.6 Design and Evaluation of Portions of Routes

Service Development Policies & Standards

A route extension will not be initiated if it violates any of the route design standards
found in Section 2.3, or causes the route as a whole to fall below the minimum riders
per unit of service or standards found earlier in Section 2.3.2.

2.4 Demand Response Service Design and Evaluation Standards
RTD continues to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel markets.
The goal of this approach is to match the type and level of service to the demand in a
given service area, thus improving performance and sustainability. As such, a variety of
non-fixed route services are provided by the RTD including the following.
2.4.1 Call-n-Ride
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive Call-n-Ride
service is characterized as a shared ride within a defined geographic service area and the
need for the passenger to arrange for pick-up in advance or be at a designated checkpoint
at prescheduled times. A Call-n-Ride service area averages about 7 square miles or
between about 2 to 30 square miles depending on its number of vehicles and service
configuration—predominantly station feeder or community-based service. Call-n-Ride often
provides first/last mile access to the broader RTD network of services through timed
connections at transfer centers and Park-n-Rides. Population plus employment is 3 to 12
persons per acre. Call-n-Ride service is evaluated based on passenger boardings per
revenue hour and subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
Access-a-Ride provides ADA complementary paratransit in the District to individuals who
cannot readily access the bus and rail system. As per US DOT requirements the
passenger’s trip origin and destination must be within ¾ mile of RTD’s non-commuter bus
route system, during the same days and hours of their operation and within the District
boundaries, and curb-to-curb service must be provided. However, RTD provides door-todoor service as a reasonable accommodation. Trips must be booked at least one day and
up to 3 days in advance; however, RTD also offers subscriptions.
All applicants must qualify for certification under the guidelines established by the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, complete a functional evaluation in person,
provide a physician’s statements to verify disability and must meet one of the following
criteria:
• Be unable to get to and from a bus stop or on and off a lift-equipped bus by yourself
• Have a cognitive disability that prohibits your understanding of how to complete bus
trips
2.4.3 Vanpooling
Vanpooling is a public transportation option in which commuters, whose residences are
geographically clustered, ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically vanpools make one roundtrip per day and

Service Development Policies & Standards

carry from 5 to 14 riders. Vanpooling offers greater opportunities for increased capacity
compared to carpooling and offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit in
areas of low employment density and longer commute distances. RTD contracts for this
service with DRCOG to subsidize the portion of the commute trip within the District.
Vanpool service is evaluated based on subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.4 SeniorRide and Senior Shopper
SeniorRide Special Events transports groups to a variety of cultural, educational and
entertainment events. The Schedule of events is published 3 times a year to the public.
Service is available on a first come first served basis. A minimum of 10 passengers per
trip is required. Scheduled events that do not generate reservations of at least 2 groups of
10 may be reconsidered as to whether or not to schedule such event(s) during the next 12
months.
SeniorShopper buses have established routes that provide trips to major grocery stores.
Service is available Monday through Friday. A minimum of 10 passengers per trip is
required.

2.5 Reliability
On-time for fixed-route service is defined as not more than 1 minute early to not more than
5 minutes late. RTD sets annual objectives for on-time performance by class of service
and which are reported in the Quarterly Performance Report. [Improved methods for
monitoring, identifying the causes and remedying unreliable service are currently in
development.]

3. Geometric Design Standards
3.1 Directness of Route
Routes shall be designed to be as direct as possible and to provide maximum accessibility
to transit.
• Deviations from a direct path from end-to-end of the route shall account for no more
than one-quarter of the end-to-end travel time of the route.
•

For a specific deviation, the total additional travel time for all through passengers
should not exceed three minutes for each rider boarding or alighting along the
deviation.
In mathematical terms, this means that the quantity
Pt * VTT < 3 minutes
Pd
where: Pt = through passengers
VTT = additional vehicle one-way travel time
Pd = passengers served by deviation

3.3 Roadway Design Goal
New bus routes should not be operated along streets that do not meet minimum
standards, such as for bus turning radius, pavement strength/loading, lane width, roadway
grade, shoulder width on rural roads (for pedestrian waiting and safety) and overhead
clearance. Refer to the RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria Section 1 –
Transit Access for specific details.

4. Shelters
The minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter is 40 boardings per day at the stop.
Stops with the highest average of daily boardings will take top priority for shelter
placement. [Revised standards are currently in development and will reference the RTD
Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria.]

5. Area Coverage Standards
5.1 Purpose and Application
The purpose of these standards is to define a reasonable level of service to all areas of the
District and to help RTD maintain this service level. Since the RTD service area includes
many different types of development, and population densities and land use vary widely
across the District, it would not be reasonable to expect all areas to support the same level
of service. Moreover, different types of service may best meet the needs of different
areas, and RTD's resources can be used in a more productive fashion if service can be
tailored to the needs of particular areas. Area coverage standards provide guidelines for
tailoring service to the needs of communities and help ensure that all areas receive a level
of service that is commensurate with their needs.

3.2 Stop Spacing Standards

Service Development Policies & Standards

Levels of service for specific areas also depend on the productivity of existing services. If
existing or proposed services cannot meet the productivity standards outlined in Section 2,
RTD may choose not to provide the minimum level of service. Financial constraints may
also limit RTD's ability to meet the area coverage (or any other) standards.

5.2 Coverage Levels Outside the Denver CBD
The area coverage standards for areas outside the Denver Central Business District (CBD)
are based on a combined density measure. This measure adds population and employment
to determine potential demand for transportation to and from a particular area.
[Attachment B shows the density classifications overlaid with RTD services for the entire
District.]
The area coverage standards presented below deal with route spacing. Actual route
spacing and service frequency will depend on demand and productivity of existing service
in the area.
For use in this document, arterial roadways are defined as follows:
• Traffic flow controlled by traffic signals as opposed to stop signs
• Carry longer distance traffic flow
• Speed limit 30 mph or faster
• Road width two plus lanes in each direction
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre
• Peak period Park-n-Ride service if either the travel time to the Denver CBD by Express
bus or rail, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.
• Call-n-Ride service.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
• Local service on major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
• Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from Park-n-Rides if either the travel
time to the Denver CBD by bus, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.

(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the core service area is that area in which
corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on each side of each fixed route
merge together such that, with few and small exceptions, all origins and
destinations within the area would be served.
“(2) Rail.
(i) For rail systems, the service area shall consist of a circle with a radius of 3/4 of
a mile around each station.
(ii) At end stations and other stations in outlying areas, the entity may designate
circles with radii of up to 11/2 miles as part of its service area, based on local
circumstances.
“(3) Jurisdictional boundaries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph, an entity is not required to provide paratransit service in an area outside
the boundaries of the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates, if the entity does not have
legal authority to operate in that area. The entity shall take all practicable steps to
provide paratransit service to any part of its service area.”
“Requirements for complementary paratransit do not apply to commuter bus …
fixed route bus service, characterized by service predominantly in one direction
during peak periods, limited stops, use of multi-ride tickets, and routes of extended
length, usually between the central business district and outlying suburbs.”

6. Transit Access
RTD has guidelines for access to its facilities for pedestrians, bus riders, bicyclists,
passenger loading, and parking. The RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and
Criteria, included here by reference, is intended to be used by RTD in conjunction with
local jurisdictions in planning transit access (including projects under construction).

7. Service Guidelines for Special Events and Special Services
7.1 Derivation of Standards
The following guidelines for provision of bus and/or train service to special events are
based on prior RTD Board actions and on the public convenience and necessity to:
•
•
•

Protect neighborhoods from the impact of events which are so large as to overwhelm
the surrounding supply of parking, and
Serve customers by offering adequate service for events which are predictably large
enough to overload the normally available transit service, and
Protect taxpayers by only serving those events that have a predictable level of transit
demand great enough to justify the operation of special routes.

Standards for Events

RTD, within the limits of its budget, will operate special service:
•
•
•

For events at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium with projected attendance of over
55,000, for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
For events at Coors Field with projected attendance of over 40,000, for which the
crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
At other venues where the ratio of projected attendance to available on-site parking is
6:1 and for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.

This service will not be provided when substantial numbers of the event patrons can be
expected to arrive in privately operated or non-profit owned buses or regularly scheduled
RTD service.
RTD will provide Express Shuttle service to Invesco Field and Coors Field from selected
Park-n-Rides for events described in this section. The General Manager must specifically
authorize Park-n-Ride service for other events.

8. Shuttles & Circulators
8.1 Characteristics
Shuttle and circulator routes are not defined as a separate class of service, but are
typically proposed to serve specific, local, community-focused needs. Shuttle and
circulator routes are generally defined by the following characteristics: short routes,
usually less than 5 miles long; operate on local streets and arterials; connect major activity
centers; and serve short passenger trip lengths within a single community. Fares must be
set according to RTD Fare Policy.

8.2 Guidelines for Success
Several factors are critical to shuttle and circulator success. As a guideline to make
informed decisions, the following characteristics must be present and considered.
•

A sustained average population density of at least 10 people per acre along the length
of the route is a minimum requirement; a critical mass of potential riders is needed to
succeed.

•

Connects community residences with major activity centers such as colleges, high
schools, middle schools, shopping districts (but not auto-centric malls), medical
centers, and downtowns that appeal to all market segments (youth, families, seniors)
and can serve a variety of trip purposes.

•

Transit friendly environment: pedestrian friendly, walkable streets are a minimum;
mixed land uses; areas of clustered shopping or employment; public spaces; and
bicycle parking/paths.

9. System-Wide Cost Recovery Standard
The state required system-wide minimum cost recovery ratio is 30 percent. This ratio is
calculated by the following formula:
[Farebox Revenues + Advertising Revenues + Lease Revenues + FTA Operating
Assistance + Other Non-Sales Tax Revenues ] / [Category Costs applied according to
RTD Cost Model Memo, June 15, 2010, as updated (See summary below)]

Cost Model Summary
With the exception of Private Carrier costs, all costs are allocated to routes by one of
three methods: hours, miles or vehicles. The RTD Bus Cost Model has five cost categories:
Variable/Direct, Variable/Indirect, Private Carrier, Retained Costs and Depreciation. Private
Carrier costs are allocated to routes by the number of hours the contractor operates the
route, multiplied by the average hourly rate billed for that particular contract, plus the
average hourly cost for fuel.
The annual budget and six-year Strategic Budget Plan are evaluated using this cost
recovery standard. If the standard is not met, several courses of action may be taken.
The RTD Board has adopted a policy of evaluating the fare structure as part of the annual
budget process; fares may be changed at that time to provide additional revenue. RTD
may also choose to market its services more aggressively to attract more customers and
their fares, or RTD may look for revenue from other sources. The productivity standards in
Sections 2 and 3 may be used to reduce the costs of providing service while disrupting
service to as few passengers as possible.

10. Title VI & Environmental Justice Compliance

11. Standard for Service for Transit Dependent Persons and
To Social Service Destinations
For purposes of these service standards, transit dependent riders are defined as riders who
either live in a household which does not own a car or who have a physical or mental
disability that prevents the transit patron from driving a car. Social Service destinations
are those destinations that are provided as a public service that may not have consistently
sufficient ridership to otherwise warrant the establishment or continuation of a route or
route segment. Examples of social service destinations would include county court
facilities, hospitals, schools, or public institutions which have been situated or constructed
in isolated locations prior to the establishment of RTD or following review and comment by
RTD of the proposed development plans of such institution or agency, by the appropriate
jurisdiction.

11.1 Purpose of the Standard
This standard is intended to provide for consideration of transit dependency in service
decisions. This standard does not guarantee a minimum level of service to all transitdependent riders. However, it will ensure that transit-dependent riders and/or the need to
have access to social service destinations are identified and considered when decisions are
made to reduce service levels in an area.

11.2 Determination of Transit Dependency
Whenever RTD plans changes to an existing route where there is no alternative service
available to meet the area coverage standards in Section 5 such as a change in routing or
span of service, transit-dependent riders will be identified through on-board surveys. This
survey will ask questions about riders' travel habits and demographics, and it will attempt
to identify transit-dependent riders and their destinations.

1.E.1.c

The applicable minimum productivity standards for a route will be reduced by one-half the
percentage of ridership that is defined as transit dependent. Thus, if 60 percent of the
riders on a route are transit dependent, the route must achieve 70 percent [100 percent
minus (60 percent divided by 2)] of the applicable productivity standards (ridership and
economic) in order not to be considered a poor performer.
Applicable ridership standards for fixed route services may be found in Section 2.3, and
for non-fixed route services, in Section 2.4.
If the on-board survey reveals that the route does not serve the destinations desired by
transit-dependent riders, RTD may restructure the route to improve service and increase
ridership. This could include changing the routing or schedule to serve passenger needs.
RTD wishes to provide transit dependent riders with service that fits their needs and to
provide service to social service destinations when there is even a modicum of recognized
demand.
Another consideration to be given in whether or not to eliminate a route with some transit
dependent passengers is the impact on required Access-A-Ride services. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that eligible persons with disabilities be provided with
paratransit service if they have trip origins and destinations within a defined service area
three-fourths of a mile from a non-commuter fixed route. If accessible fixed route service
is considered for removal from a portion of the defined paratransit service area, an
estimate of the demand for substitute Access-A-Ride service for persons with disabilities
who require lift-equipped buses must be completed and a cost-benefit analysis performed
for the alternatives (leaving fixed route versus providing Access-A-Ride service).

12. Service Change Process
The following is a description of the steps necessary in developing and implementing
service changes, which are typically conducted each year in January, May and
September—also called runboards—as required by Board policy and the Collective
Bargaining Agreement.
Proposals are derived from a variety of inputs continuously throughout the year including:
periodic customer, household and employer surveys; stakeholder meetings; service
performance evaluation; and changing demographics and land uses. They are compiled for
each runboard and evaluated based on a number of factors, including RTD annual budget,
RTD Service Standards, effects on the transit network and on transit dependent markets
(Title VI), cost-effective services throughout the District and responsiveness to changes in
the communities within RTD. A Board paper is compiled and presented to the Board,
stakeholders and public for consideration.
Staff then discusses the proposals with members of the Board, stakeholders and senior
staff and coordinates with other staff including Marketing, Operations, Facilities and
Finance. Modifications are made as warranted and then the proposals enter the pubic

engagement process: formally scheduled public hearings; informal presentations upon
request; repository for customer input—service.changes@rtd-denver; responses to General
Manager and Board Member requests. Upon completion of public engagement, all
previous input is compiled and evaluated and revisions to the proposals are made as
warranted. A final Board report is prepared with a summary and details of proposed
changes and a summary of public hearings and other public input for approval of the
Board.
The approved changes then go into a comprehensive production process which includes:
schedule creation; bus and operator requirements and assignments; compliance with
privatization policy; runcutting and compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement;
marketing promotions and public relations; bus stop and on-street changes; printed and
electronic public information, including maps and timetables; and validation and
distribution of all data within the Transit Information Exchange System (TIES).

13. Cost Sharing Policy
13.1 Background
On June 21, 1994, the RTD Board of Directors passed a resolution, Transit Service CostSharing Policy, to provide guidance to RTD staff in responding to the increasing number of
requests for new service. This policy authorized the General Manager to pursue cost
sharing as a method of providing transit service using RTD revenues and other funds
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments; this has
resulted in a number of RTD partnerships in demonstrating new services. The following
incorporates this experience and provides guidance on the application and limitations of
cost-sharing arrangements.

13.2 Guidance
13.2.1 Financial Feasibility
Financial feasibility depends not only on the availability of funds, but also on consideration
of fares, cost/revenue allocation and equity.
•

•

Net operating cost (subsidy) needs to be defined so that all partners are treated
equitably. Net cost is the total operating cost less farebox revenue and other operating
revenues and any grant revenues secured on behalf of the proposed service. The
application of grant revenues prior to the net cost sharing allows all partners to
participate in the benefits of grant funding.
Cost-sharing projects need to adopt the RTD fare structure for similar services for
reasons of equity. Furthermore, this places all projects on the same revenue basis for
calculating net operating cost. Project sponsors may propose a fare that does not
follow the RTD fare structure. For these projects the partner is required to fund the full
difference in revenue between the comparable RTD fare and the project fare, based on

•

actual ridership. The adoption of any non-conforming (economically or technically) fare
is always subject to Board approval.
Costs associated with vehicles are addressed project by project. Vehicles can be
purchased outright by project sponsors with grant funds or provided from the RTD
inventory. Should new vehicles be required, grants should fund their acquisition and
the local share split equally by the cost-sharing partners. If no grant funds are used,
RTD will limit its share to 10%, half of the usual local share when grant funds are
used. If the RTD operates the service and agrees to provide the vehicles from its
inventory, capital costs need not be included as part of the project cost unless special
accommodations are required.
Cost-sharing projects are new or expanded transit services and RTD’s share must be
budgeted out of allocations for new services for the entire District. Thus any partner
with expectations for RTD financial or operational participation must first obtain
commitment from RTD before applying for project grants. In addition, each project will
be subject to the appropriate RTD and DRCOG planning processes, especially as
regards estimates of costs, ridership, revenue and other benefits.

13.2.2 Vehicle Availability
RTD may have, with some minor modifications, vehicles readily available to provide the
proposed service. In some cases projects require a specialty or significantly modified
vehicle that must be acquired, subject to RTD approval for fleet maintenance compatibility.
Financing these vehicles is addressed above. Sometimes the availability of operators has
been more critical.
13.2.3 Local and Community Support
Local and community entities (e.g., government, employers, businesses and associations)
generally initiate cost-sharing transit projects concomitant with other plans and
developments in the community. Thus the proposed transit project is designed to address
a specific development or perceived need. To advance their project for implementation, an
entity such as a city, will offer to share in the net costs of providing the service. RTD
needs to be responsive to these requests, but keep them in the context of the needs of
the entire District.
•

•
•

Projects generally have substantial institutional support; however they are subject to
the same public scrutiny, for example public hearings, as any other proposed service
change. Implementation of any cost-sharing project will continue to be subject to
RTD’s public review process.
RTD generally provides 50% of the local share of the net operating and/or capital cost
of a project. This cost-sharing ratio may be adjusted in consideration of the District
budget and policies.
Cost-sharing arrangements for each project are of limited duration for which agreed
upon performance milestones must be reached (see below). The purpose of the test
period is to assess the sustainability of the service and decide RTD’s and its partners
continuing participation. The test period is typically set at one, two or three years, as
appropriate to the project. Performance milestones must be set and evaluated and a
recommendation regarding continuation made for each year of the project.

Service Development Policies & Standards

1.E.1.c

Cost-sharing services will have clearly defined evaluative criteria agreed upon within the
cost-sharing agreement and prior to implementation.
•

•

•

•

At a minimum these criteria will include average daily ridership and RTD Service
Standards within the appropriate class of service for passenger boardings per hour and
subsidy per boarding. Additional criteria may also address issues related to project
objectives, such as new riders. State mandated cost recovery may also be considered.
Expectations of performance will be laid out in the form of milestones, such as a range
or minimum attainment at the end of each year.
During the first year performance will be assessed to determine if expectations have
been met and if continuation of the service is warranted. Often an experimental
service will need to be changed to improve performance. As warranted the same
assessment will be made in each succeeding year during the test period. This
assessment and recommendation regarding continuation will be reported to the RTD
Board each year of the test period.
If the cost-share service meets expectations and RTD Service Standards during the test
period, RTD will consider extending the period of its participation and increasing its
share of net cost; however, RTD is under no obligation to continuing any service
beyond the cost-share agreement, even if it meets Service Standards. If the cost-share
service does not perform up to expectations, RTD funding participation in such project
will be reduced or discontinued. These decisions are subject to the customary financial
and Board review.
Should RTD decide to discontinue or reduce its funding of the project service, a
sponsoring partner may choose to continue its funding by entering into a cost-sharing
agreement with RTD. This agreement will specify the service to be provided and its
cost, will be annually reviewed for potential renewal and will be subject to all RTD
Service Standards, budgeting and public processes.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2025 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

March 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
March 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for the May 2025
service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The service changes proposed for May 2025 facilitate opportunities for frontline employees to select
new work assignments and for Service Development to adjust the overall operations plan for the transit
network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the System Optimization Plan (SOP) in July 2022,
several of the service change proposals reflect SOP implementation to provide the best possible value to
customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color, or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority populations1
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD
to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold to determine whether those changes will disproportionately impact Black or
1

Hereinafter referred to as BIPOC populations.

Packet Pg. 50

1.E.2

Indigenous populations or populations of Persons of Color (collectively “BIPOC”) or low-income
populations. The May 2025 service change recommendation includes nine major service changes out of
35 total changes. Thus, an analysis is required to be brought before the Board for its consideration. The
complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis report is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
•

Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.

•

Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

DISCUSSION
Staff recommends changes to 29 bus routes (and related patterns) and six rail lines in the forthcoming
service change recommendation. Of these changes, nine services have proposed additions to service
25% greater than that of baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service
change. Those routes are shown in the following table.

Schedule Timing

BOLT

Service Increase

Free MetroRide, 16, 44, 73, 153, NB

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group, and system level to identify any potential disparities in service changes
based on race/ethnicity or income.

Packet Pg. 51

1.E.2

Summary of Findings:
• Potential disparate impacts were identified at the individual route level for the four following
routes:
o Free MetroRide. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population benefits from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.16%). A higher
percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed major
service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (0.23%).
o Route 225/225D. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population benefits from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.67-0.68%). A
higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed
major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.43-1.44%).
o DASH. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population benefits from the proposed
major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.55-0.75%). A higher
percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed major
service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.03%).
o Route NB. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population benefits from the proposed
major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.19%). A slightly higher
percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed major
service increase as compared to non-low-income population (0.23%).
•

No potential disproportionate burden findings were identified at the route level.

•

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate, at the system level, to
determine overall impacts to equity populations compared to non-equity populations. For systemlevel service changes (all increases), BIPOC populations stand to benefit less than non-BIPOC
populations (43.97% vs. 50.82%, respectively). This difference meets the disparate impact
threshold of 45.74%. Therefore, there is a system-level disparate impact finding with the
proposed major service increases. Low-income populations stand to benefit more than non-lowincome populations (64.09% vs. 41.23%, respectively). The difference does not meet the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 37.1%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden
is found with the proposed major service increases.

Conclusions:
Although four major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and a system-level disparate
impact finding, RTD recommends proceeding with the May 2025 service plan as proposed. This decision
is based on the substantial legitimate justification of implementing these improvements in alignment with
the Board-approved System Optimization Plan, as well as the lack of practical alternatives to avoid,
minimize, or mitigate these impacts. The proposed service plan offers significant overall benefits to
customers, with notable advantages for BIPOC customers, even if they may not benefit as much from
the major service changes as other groups. Of the nine major service changes (out of 35 total), all serve
low-income communities, and four specifically serve BIPOC communities. Additionally, route-level
analysis indicates minimal Title VI concerns, with benefit differences of 0.16%, 0.67-0.68%, 0.550.75%, and 0.19% per route. Further, several service improvements that do not meet the major service
change threshold will enhance on-time performance for 14 bus routes and six rail lines, increase service

Packet Pg. 52

1.E.2

on the N Line, and implement five individual SOP-related initiatives. Since these changes represent
service increases, they benefit all RTD customers, including BIPOC and low-income individuals. As a
result, the major service changes do not raise concerns about the inequitable distribution of benefits.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Priorities of Community
Value and Customer Excellence while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will
continue to assess the equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose
adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for the May 2025 runboard to
ensure that the changes will not inequitably impact minority (hereafter referred to as Black, Indigenous, and
People of Color, or BIPOC) and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts, and disproportionate burdens. RTD analyzed the route and block group levels to identify any potential
disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
In the forthcoming runboard, RTD proposes changes to 29 bus routes (and related patterns) and six rail
lines. Of these changes, nine services meet established thresholds for a major service change.
The tabulation below includes proposed adjustments that were greater than 25% of baseline service and are
proposed for the long-term (will remain in effect for 12 or more months).

Schedule Timing

Service Increase (Six services)

Route Adjustment (Two services)

BOLT: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance
and to address construction impacts along Colorado Highway
119 and 28th Street.
Free MetroRide: Reinstate permanently during the AM and
PM Peak on weekdays with 10-minute headways.
Route 16: Service increase to provide 10-minute peak
frequency as depicted in the System Optimization Plan (SOP).
Route 44: Add two trips in each of the weekday AM and PM
peak periods, in the peak direction of travel only, to increase
frequency from 60 to 30 minutes.
Route 73: Increase service levels to match service described
in the RTD Board-adopted SOP.
Route 153: Increase service levels to match service described
in the RTD Board-adopted SOP.
NB: End seasonal service to Eldora Ski Resort while increasing
service levels to pre-COVID levels per the SOP: 60 minutes
weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays/Holidays.
Route 225/225D: Extend the route to the new Boulder
County Low Income Housing Development, Willoughby, at
120th Avenue and Emma, weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
DASH: Extend the route to the new Boulder County Low
Income Housing Development, Willoughby, at 120th Avenue
and Emma, weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

1.E.2.a

Findings

Major service changes included in the proposed May 2025 service changes include increases to service levels
and spans, one route renaming, various running time/schedule improvements, route realignments due to
construction related detours, route extensions, as well as the suspensions of school tripper services while school
is out of session.
At the system level, four of the nine routes proposed for major service changes serve average or above-average
BIPOC populations compared to the entire service area, and all routes with major service changes are well above
the average threshold for low-income populations. When considering the demographics within the service area
of the major service increases and as a proportion to the district overall, areas with above-average low-income
populations received a 22.86% higher increase in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to nonlow-income populations. This difference is above the 10% threshold. Areas with above-average BIPOC
populations received 6.85% less of an increase in service (i.e., were less positively impacted) compared to nonBIPOC populations. This difference does not meet the 10% threshold. However, at the route level, RTD identified
potential disparate impacts for the following four routes: Free MetroRide, Route 225/225D, DASH, and NB.
No population within the service area is proposed to be impacted by a service decrease.

Introduction
Title VI
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior
to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service change threshold, and
to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on populations comprising
Black, Indigenous, and People of Color or low-income populations.
RTD has prepared this equity analysis to document changes that are proposed to occur between the current and
proposed runboards. These changes and all others have been reviewed individually at the route/line level and
in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to RTD’s transit services. These changes
include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines, and changes to the alignment
and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service changes

needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance, sustainable
transit system.
RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
•
•
•
•
•

•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color, or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and Black,
Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes (Family of Services) depending on service type, route
alignment, and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all
routes within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify
services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment, or cancellation of service as
warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish
performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses
these metrics to identify a series of service changes.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-119.7 Farebox Recovery Ratios – Plans

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Based on requirements within FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD, as an agency receiving federal funding,
must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy.
Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity
and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects

and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a BIPOC population 10
percent more than non-BIPOC populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology

This analysis uses demographic data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year
Estimates for years 2019 to 2023 at the census block group geographic level. Other data related to the analysis
includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into a service-geographicdemographic combination relates populations with changes in service at a geographic level to aid in reviewing
potential impacts to district equity communities which include BIPOC and low-income populations.
The equity analysis for the May 2025 runboard looked at how an individual route’s major service changes
impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in changes
made to equity populations within a quarter-mile service area of a bus route or rail line. These proportional
differences were compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line
proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for population within the district is derived from Census Bureau population estimates and is
based on 150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services
guidelines), based on local context, which is an annual income of $38,730 for a family of three. BIPOC status is
based on the non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area is based on the
collection of block groups wholly or partially within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population is determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area is then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contains 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculates the net change in service hours for each route/line proposal to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change meeting or exceeding a 25% change (either positive or negative) from
baseline is flagged as a major service change for further review.

Public Outreach Overview
RTD held three public meetings on March 3-4, 2025. Table 1 below provides a summary of the feedback received
on major service changes during these meetings, including the meeting locations, dates, attendance numbers,
and key themes from attendees' comments.
In addition to general outreach, the Transit Equity Office emailed 329 community-based organizations and key
activity centers—such as senior housing facilities, affordable housing communities, schools, places of worship,
and government social service agencies—to share information and gather feedback. The Communications and
Engagement Department also contacted 821 community members and key activity centers to inform them about
the proposed service changes and encourage public input.
To further raise awareness, RTD issued three news releases to regional media outlets and delivered multiple
presentations on the proposed changes to Subregional Service Councils, the Citizen Advisory Committee, and
Transportation Management Associations.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact, and Disproportionate Burden
Analyses

RTD categorized proposed service changes for the runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service
by equity population (BIPOC or non-BIPOC, low-income or non-low-income) for comparison. Routes/lines were
categorized as either “equity” or “non-equity” routes based on their identification within the prior (current)
network using 2019-2023 ACS five-year demographic data.
RTD completed a comparative, proportional equity analysis to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for BIPOC populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a potential finding of impact.

Major Service Change Test
Identify routes with proposed major service changes (based on trips or hours) of 25% or more
that will remain in effect for 12 or more months

Changes by Transit Mode
For the May 2025 runboard, RTD proposes various service changes to 29 bus routes (and related route
patterns) and six rail lines. Of these, 20 routes will see combined increases in bus service of over 252 total
weekday revenue service hours and 84 additional weekend service hours. Routes 225 and DASH are
proposed to be extended to new areas of Boulder County, and the Free MetroRide will be permanently reinstated.
Major service increases are also proposed for six other bus routes.

Major Service Change Review

Please find a complete listing of all service changes in Appendix A. RTD first reviewed changes in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases (service increases of 25% or more related to new or restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions
There are no major service reductions proposed for the proposed runboard.

Major Service Change Increases

Nine bus routes had proposed major service increases. Improved headways are proposed for several routes,
and four routes have service increases as outlined in the RTD Board approval of the Systemwide Optimization
Plan (SOP).

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB) on both service reductions and service increases. For service increases, the
analysis examines the extent to which BIPOC and low-income populations benefit compared to non-BIPOC
and/or non-low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the
changes burden BIPOC and low-income populations compared to non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income
populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the district’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, RTD reviewed the demographics of each of the major service changes’
routes/lines for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to
which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of BIPOC and low-income populations. Because these are
proposed service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential
concerns. The narrative analysis of each individual route/line follows, which includes further considerations of
access to jobs, education, health care, food, and social services for BIPOC and low-income populations.

Route 16
Proposal: As outlined in the RTD Board-approved SOP, it is proposed to increase service to provide 10-minute
peak frequency.
As shown in Table 3, a higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.49% vs. 0.70%,
respectively). This difference is above the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.63%). Therefore, no
potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. A slightly higher percentage of the district’s BIPOC
population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.89%
vs. 0.80%, respectively). This difference is above the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.72%). Thus, there is
no potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public
service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis).

Route 225/225D
Proposal: It is proposed to extend the route to the new Boulder County Low Income Housing Development,
Willoughby, at 120th Avenue and Emma, weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Current pattern 225 would remain
the same between Downtown Boulder Station and Lafayette Park-n-Ride. Pattern 225D would be extended to
the new terminal via Baseline Road/120th Street/Canterbury Drive. Service frequency is proposed to be every
30 minutes between patterns 225 and 225D between Downtown Boulder Station and Baseline/Public Road then
splitting into hourly frequency for the extensions to Lafayette Park-n-Ride and Willoughby.
As shown in Table 7, a higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (1.96% vs. 0.52%, respectively).
This difference is above the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.47%). Therefore, no potential route-level
disproportionate burden is found. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population benefits from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.53% vs. 1.20%, respectively).
This difference falls below the 10% disparate impact threshold (1.08%). Thus, there is a potential disparate
impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations,
community engagement and network level analysis).

DASH
Proposal: It is proposed to extend the route to the new Boulder County Low Income Housing Development,
Willoughby, at 120th Avenue and Emma, weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Current Route DASH pattern would
extend from Lafayette Park-n-Ride via Public Road/Spaulding Street/Merlin Drive/Emma Street/120th Street to
the new terminal on Canterbury Drive. Service frequency is proposed to be every 30 minutes all day, weekdays
and Saturdays and every 60 minutes all day, Sundays, and Holidays.
As shown in Table 9, a higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (1.76% vs. 0.73%, respectively).
This difference is above the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.66%). Therefore, no potential route-level

Saturdays, and Sundays/Holidays with service spans of 5:30am – 11:00pm weekdays, 7:00am – 11:00pm
Saturdays and 7:00am – 9:00pm Sundays/Holidays.
As shown in Table 11, a slightly higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit

Systemwide Analysis

In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system-level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI-protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and BIPOC populations are established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•

Systemwide, bus service revenue hours increase by over 252 for weekday, 38 for Saturday, and 46 for
Sunday service.
Of the nearly 340,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, BIPOC
populations represented a slightly below-average share of population while low-income populations

•

represented a much higher than average share of population compared to district averages. Of this total,
over 80,000 low-income people and over 118,000 BIPOC people would receive service improvements.
At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. Bus routes with major service increases serve above-average low-income and slightly
below-average BIPOC populations. All routes are considered low-income-serving routes, while four of the
nine routes are considered BIPOC-serving routes.

In review of the proposed major service changes at the systemwide level, there is a potential
disparate impact finding.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and BIPOC populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the May 2025 service change. Block groups with low-income and BIPOC populations at or above the district
average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas block groups with non-low-income and
non-BIPOC populations are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.1%) and
BIPOC population (38.1%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity
versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential
adverse impacts.

There are 2,220 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District.2 Using the 2019-2023
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
BIPOC population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and BIPOC rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average. While
the percent BIPOC figure of 38.1% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.08 million),
the low-income population percentage of 14.1% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure (3.04 million).
This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine.3 The thresholds
summarized in Error! Reference source not found. yielded 827 (37.2% of all) block groups above the district
average for low-income population, and 856 (38.6%) block groups above the district average for BIPOC
population.

1

Based on existence of the route within the January 2025 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops
or rail stations. 2019-2023 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.
2
Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population due to
the inability of the Census to determine income for everyone estimated to reside in a particular block group.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate to determine overall impacts to underlying
population. Error! Reference source not found. summarizes the change in service for total block group
populations underlying the bus stops with proposed major service increases proportionally compared to
population in the District. There are no proposed service decreases. The comparison reviews the equity
composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes compared to the overall equity
composition of the District overall.
No major service changes were proposed for rail services in this runboard.

For system-level service changes (all increases), BIPOC populations stand to benefit less than non-BIPOC
populations (43.97% vs. 50.82%, respectively). This difference meets the disparate impact threshold of
45.74%. Therefore, a system-level disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major service increase.
Low-income populations stand to benefit more than non-low-income populations (64.09% vs.
41.23%, respectively). The difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold of 37.1%.
Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is found with the proposed major service increase.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above average low-income and BIPOC block groups within the District
as well as highlight services with major service changes (orange). Routes with major service changes serve
many areas with above-average district averages for BIPOC and low-income populations such as Routes 16, 44,

Summary of Findings
The systemwide service modifications proposed for May 2025 include schedule adjustments, suspension of
school trips and changes to summer schedules, route extensions, and the addition of more service. Major
changes include those for Routes 16, 44, 73, 153, 225, DASH, Free MetroRide, BOLT, and NB.

Route-level Findings
Of the 35 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, four had potential findings:
•

•

•

•

Free MetroRide has a potential disparate impact. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC
population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population
(0.16%). A higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed
major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (0.23%).
Route 225/225D has a potential disparate impact. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC
population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population
(0.67-0.68%). A higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (1.43-1.44%).
DASH has a potential disparate impact. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population
benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.550.75%). A higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed
major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.03%).
Route NB has a potential disparate impact. A lower percentage of the district’s BIPOC population
benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-BIPOC population (0.19%).
A slightly higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed
major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (0.23%).

Table 14 summarizes major service changes by change type, provides findings of potential disparate impacts
and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis, and provides the individual route
service change.

Systemwide-level Findings
•

•

Almost 340,000 people live near bus stops of routes with major service changes. BIPOC populations are
represented at slightly lower shares of the population than district averages (35.14%). However, lowincome populations are represented by nearly 12 percentage points higher than the district average
(25.8%) and those within block groups of major service changes represent 64% of the district’s lowincome population (BIPOC populations within the block groups with major service increases represent
44% of the district’s BIPOC population.)
When considering the proposed service increases for the nearly 1.48 million people within the block
groups that include the route’s stops and as a proportion to the district overall, BIPOC populations
stand to benefit less compared to non-BIPOC populations. Above-average BIPOC population
areas received 6.85% less of a benefit compared to non-BIPOC areas. The difference was below the
disparate impact threshold by 1.77%; therefore, a potential systemwide disparate impact was
found. Low-income populations received 22.86% more benefit than non-low-income
populations. The difference was 26.98% above the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden;
therefore, no potential disproportionate burden was found with the proposed service increase.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden
Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on BIPOC riders or disproportionate burden on lowincome customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Although four major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and a system-level disparate impact
finding, RTD recommends proceeding with the May 2025 service plan as proposed. This decision is based on the
substantial legitimate justification of implementing these improvements in alignment with the Board-approved
System Optimization Plan as well as the lack of practical alternatives to avoid, minimize, or mitigate these
impacts.
The proposed service plan offers significant overall benefits to customers, with notable advantages for BIPOC
customers, even if they may not benefit as much from the major service changes as other groups. Of the nine
major service changes (out of 35 total), all serve low-income communities, and four specifically serve BIPOC
communities. Additionally, route-level analysis indicates minimal Title VI concerns, with benefit differences of
0.16%, 0.67-0.68%, 0.55-0.75%, and 0.19% per route.
Further, several service improvements that do not meet the major service change threshold will enhance ontime performance for 14 bus routes and six rail lines, increase service on the N Line, and implement five individual
SOP initiatives. Since these changes represent service increases, they benefit all RTD customers, including BIPOC
and low-income individuals. As a result, the major service changes do not raise concerns about the inequitable
distribution of benefits.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2025 Service Change

March 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
March 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the May 2025 Service Change as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by the service changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift selection process detailed in the Collective
Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Local Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001,
the May 2025 Service Change proposal facilitates opportunities for Service Development Division staff
to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit network and Operations Department personnel to select
new work assignments.
DISCUSSION
Considering the current staffing levels, operators in training, and anticipated attrition, the May 2025
service change recommendations were designed with careful consideration toward staff availability. The
recommendations are centered on continued System Optimization Plan (SOP)/Comprehensive Operations
Analysis (COA) implementation, the restoration of services and system capacity, seasonal adjustments,
and improving system performance and reliability by way of service enhancements, reductions, and
adjustments.
The May 2025 service change recommendation contains several SOP/COA-related increases and
optimizations. Among the more notable changes are:
•
•
•
•
•

Increases to service frequency on Route 16 – West Colfax
Increases to midday service frequency on Route 73 – Quebec Street
Increases to service frequency on Route 153 – Chambers Road
Reintroduction of the Free Metro Ride 18th/19th Street service
Extension of service to the Willoughby Corner development via Routes 225 and DASH (nonSOP/COA)

Packet Pg. 116

1.E.3

In alignment with RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and
recognizing the agency’s people power availability, the proposals herein are directed at improving ontime performance, maintaining compliance with RTD’s CBA with the ATU Local 1001, and adjusting
service levels to match ridership demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
The service changes summarized below are further detailed in Attachment A.
Summary of Public Outreach
Between February 13 and March 6, 2025, RTD held a public comment period for community input
regarding the May 2025 recommended service changes. Public meetings were held via Zoom (virtual).
Additionally, an updated feedback process was employed to collect customer input by impacted route or
line. Written communications, survey data, and public comments collected during this public comment
period have been summarized and listed in Attachments F and G of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service modifications are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of the
public comment process and continued analysis, staff may recommend additional revisions to these
initial modifications. The following modifications have been added or significantly revised:
Route 16 – West Colfax: to be amended in the SOP, service frequency increased from 15 to 10 minutes
during midday and p.m. peak periods.
Route 93L – North Colorado Boulevard Limited: schedule adjustments to improve connections with the N
Line at Thornton Crossroads – 104th Station.
L Line – 30th/Downing to 16th/Stout: schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance,

I am writing to request that the C-Line from downtown Littleton to Union Station and back, be reinstated
during the May 2025 changes.
I moved to Denver in 2021 and chose to live downtown across the street from Union Station on Wewatta

I moved from a suburban city south of Houston, TX. and was excited for all of the transportation options
downtown Denver has to offer.
I am a 66yo female senior citizen who is not yet retired. I enjoy commuting to and from downtown

Hi my name is Eric Mannino, I would like to see route 403 be restored to service for the May 2025 service
changes with hourly service on weekdays from 5 AM till 11 PM with Saturday service from 6 AM till 10 PM
and Sunday service from 7 AM till 9 PM is because i used to take it pre COVID so did other people. I also
would like to see the full implementation of SOP route 483 for the May 2025 service changes is because I
take that route and I see ridership trending upwards for that full SOP implementation of that route to
happen. Lastly I would like to see the full SOP implementation of route 24 for the May 2025 service

C line service to Union Station

I am Patrick, a 27yo resident in JeffCo near Clement Park for the last 5 years. I am writing concerning
service for the Littleton-Mineral branch of the light rail. Specifically about the re-opening of service
along the old C line to Union Station. I heard about these emails from another friend who
independently is trying to generate support for this, so I thought I would add my own thoughts as
well.
As it stands today, from Littleton only the downtown loop, Union Station, and the I-25/Littleton
corridors are accessible with only 1 transfer. Excluding the R and L lines which serve different
purposes, residents in every other corridor have access to the majority of the light rail network with 1
transfer at Union Station (including the FreeMallRide for downtown destinations). With 15 or 30min
train frequency, necessitating additional transfers has a very noticeable effect on overall transit times
and therefore decreases the appeal of transit for many destinations.
For this reason, even if only 1 line could be operated I would prefer a C line to Union Station over the
current D line. DCPA and downtown would remain accessible by transferring once to H or using the
FreeMallRide, while access to many other destinations in the broader network is greatly accelerated
(Ball Arena, Empower Field, Coors Field, Airport, etc).
Personally, the biggest effect for me would be faster and more reliable access to the airport. The
southwest direction is one of the furthest from the airport, which makes the drive quite long and
unpleasant. Even despite the two transfers and over double the time to get there I have chosen light
rail from Littleton-Mineral over driving/Uber because it is a more pleasant ride. I believe the more that
can be done to reduce the trip duration and simplify that trip, the more attractive it could become to
even more SW/Littleton residents. Going straight from C to A would also limit any compounding
effects of delays/missed transfers increasing the reliability of arriving close to the intended time, which
is very important when trying to ensure you make a flight on time.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Hello,

I will also note that in my experience using trains to access the airport, I have multiple times found that
the E line arrives too close to the A line departure such that I end up watching the A line train leave
while trying to walk the couple blocks between the platforms. This then adds another 15 mins of
waiting to the overall trip. So even if a direct line is not feasible, if there is anything that can be done
to the timetables to give a bigger buffer between E arrivals and A departures to smooth that transfer
that would also have a big impact.
Thank you for your consideration,

Hey, awesome news on the 225 and service to Willoughby. So we're excited to see that
and hope that um helps get more ridership on that. And, you know, because I'm obliged to
say this every time I'm disappointed there's not service to Boulder Junction. I'm hoping
that will come up on the next service board change.
BRANDON
Jessie, you're muted.
JESSIE
Yeah, I need my glasses to hear as well. I should say that it is in our plans at this point in

We're in the we're in the process of getting that ready now. I've taken a visit up there

Another comment they have. Run to 43 for the SOP on weekends, please.
My last but not least comment is please secure funding to extend the D-line service to
Highlands Ranch C470 and Lucent.

JESSIE

Well, you know, as we're basically at this point in time adding things in as there's the
opportunity. In other words, where our resources allow Also, we're taking into
consideration the ridership on a given route, to make sure that it's something that we
expect to do well from day one.

ERIC MANNINO
Okay, thank you. 2026 it is. You mean January 2026?
JESSIE
No, I meant, sometime in 2026. My crystal ball was broken a long time ago.
So again, I have to look at what resources are available at that time and whether or not it
makes sense and can be tied in with other service changes so it won't be in, I would say
that it won't be placed or considered prior to
January 2026.
ERIC MANNINO
Okay, thank you. Well, another thing I talk about is the 483 three because there are
people who went back and I used to write it went before it was suspended.
JESSIE
Yeah, the 403, I'm going to say it's one of the very few routes that we still currently
operate 30 foot buses or have operated 30 foot buses on. Its ridership was below seven
persons per hour. And we will struggle to consider the Route 403 coming back.
ERIC MANNINO
Oh, that's a bummer. I need it back. Maybe in September. Can't do a study of the 403
comeback, please.

We'll take a look at it, but I can't make any promises based on his previous performance.

Okay, how many people would need it? I told there are people who want to 403 back
JESSIE
Yep, we have that comment down. So we will be sure to relay that to them.
And it's not about a number of people necessary. So it's not like something you throw or
put together on a signature list or anything, it is about more about how the service has is
performed and the population density and land use in the area. It's not like we're trying
something new or that has not been there. We are making the decisions based on what
we know about the route past performance.

My comment is… The 35 should be extended back to midnight like it was pre-pandemic
because you still got people commuting. From downtown that have to get the 31 to go to
Evans and Federal, so that way it makes it easier for them to get home to and from. And
the other thing is, too, I'm glad that the 35 has been extended.
ALEXA
Hi, thank you so much for having me. I am a huge fan of public transportation, and I
recently relocated to Little in August of 2024, and I specifically chose the apartment
where I live because of its proximity to the C line. You can imagine my surprise and
disappointment when I emailed RTD to ask what happened to the C line and I found out it
was taken away due to the low ridership during the pandemic. Aside from the fact that I
think using pandemic data to justify a cancellation of an entire service is a little bit silly, it
also is detrimental to many opportunities for both the city of Littleton and the city of
Denver. Oftentimes I don't end up taking public transportation nowadays. Because of the
lack of a direct line to Coors Field, Ball Area. It’s an easy transfer to the airport. When I go
home to see my family, if I were to take public transportation, it would end up taking me
about an hour and a half.

Just via the trains and the purses, so I am… expressing my feedback and the fact that I'm
extremely in favor of the C line, I think it would promote ridership via Decreasing
congestion on the highways. And it would discourage dangerous behaviors like drinking
and driving because a lot of the bars and young people my age that tend to go out would
want to commute back to the suburbs because that's where we live.

Hi, good evening, everybody. Hope you guys are all okay. Very high-level comment from
me tonight.

But I would very much respectfully like to remind the Service Development Division this
time that They have a part to do in turning this around. We must increase ridership. We
have put it, sorry, we have lobbied the directors to put it in the GM and CEO's goals We
are going to be highlighting it. It is the thing that really makes RTD. It justifies RTD's
existence.
So, I encourage the service development team to massively think through their scheduling
decisions. Do those transfers work? Are they three minutes? Do they show up on the next
ride? Do they show up on the transit apps? Does the product look attractive to use?
Because especially in a cold evening, waiting at one of our rail stations for a bus that could
have been scheduled three minutes later and I now have to wait 27 minutes is very much
an unattractive thing, so absolutely disrespectful reminder and
We do like the new sort of commenting process, and we'll be feeding in line by line
comments using that process. Thank you very much.
Chat Participant
Can you post the actual schedule adjustments when they are made. We can't give
thoughts on the adjustments without knowing what exactly is changing with the

You know we the public last year elected directors to care to run on a number of things,
but ridership is the big one. I'm not sure if you guys have seen the numbers that came
out, but for 2024 but they're not particularly good. You know, RTD just put 0.1% increase
in ridership You know, we're 62% of our ridership pre-pandemic other agencies in the

Well, that's special because I did actually take a minute off the L line because they're arriving at 20th

4:55
I was just curious what sort of adjustments primarily it's just in a few areas where I just need to shift a

5:07
Because even before we had to do the track maintenance that we've been doing that instituted all
these slow zones, light rail seem to be averaging like the high 80s.
5:16

Yeah, just gonna say fall.

7:04
OK, Yeah.
7:06
OK.
7:10
Did you have anything else?

Packet Pg. 147

1.E.3.f

7:11
I think that's all then.
7:16
Yeah.

7:19
Happy for the thing.
7:21
The increased service on about 73, which I guess is a different planner.
7:26
Yeah, that's a different one.
7:27
I think that would be Kelsey.
7:28
So if you want I could.
7:30
OK, we could go back to the main room and then if you want to talk to someone else, you can.
7:35
OK, I don't really have a question.
7:36
I could just put in the website feedback.
7:43
OK, Again, thanks for checking on.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

7:17
OK.

7:46
Sure.
7:54
Yeah.
7:54
And the OSS packet for next week doesn't come out until Friday.

Packet Pg. 148

1.E.3.f

7:59
Mm, Hmm.
8:03
OK, OK.
8:05
Thanks.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

8:06
Sure, thanks.
8:07
Have a good evening.
8:08
Yeah, you as well.
8:18
Hi there.
8:19
Hi.
8:19
How are you?
8:21
I'm OK today.
8:24
So I was told you had a question and I'm sorry something about all about the fleece.
8:31
Yes, correct.
8:35
So typically I I guess I need more specific like what what do you mean as far as I want, I want the three
foot all three foot buses go to transit of Angkor because there's no low ratio buses and Longmont.
8:50
That's why, well, we are trying to assign all of our 30 footers to Longmont right now because
Longmont is one of those few areas where only 30 foot buses will actually fit on most of the street
network there.

Packet Pg. 149

1.E.3.f

9:10
Why not put 40 foot butters instead all 40 foot butters instead?
9:15
The 40 foot buses cannot navigate any of the turns on the current routing for any of the 300 routes in
Longmont.

9:24
OK.
9:24
So Argos sent all those 30 footers to Longmont by May probably.
9:34
I mean we're trying to retire them, so I don't know if we're buying more 30 foot buses.
9:41
Oh, I thought you was standing from Transdiv Angkor to Transdev Longmont.
9:47
They might.
9:48
I think I used to see 30 footers on the route 35 maybe or 30 O35.
9:56
It's not 30 footer anymore.
9:57
They're 40 footers.
9:59
OK, well then I'm assuming that Transdev Inglewood, they've probably either moved their buses from
there to Longmont or they had to retire those buses.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

9:23
Oh, I didn't know that.

10:08
Actually, actually there's there's actually new style, there's New York T local 30 foot buses.
10:15
Now I'm not familiar with them because last I knew RTD was trying to get away from the 30 foot buses
'cause it hold as many people as a regular 40 foot bus.

Packet Pg. 150

1.E.3.f

10:32
I don't think they're manufactured anymore either, which is what I've heard.
10:36
Yeah.

10:42
Wow.
10:42
I don't know.
10:46
I don't know.
10:46
I was one of well, are you trying to retired 30 footers in Transdev Anklewood?
10:55
I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question what I'm trying to just tell 12 30 footers in Transdev
Anklewood, trying to retire them all.
11:03
I believe the intention is eventually they will be retired.
11:06
Yeah, I don't think they're planning to replace them with 30 footers.
11:12
OK.
11:14
Want to talk about, we won't talk about the transitive angle with 34 is moving the Longmonts, all of
them.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

10:38
OK.

11:23
This would probably be a better discussion for somebody outside of service development.
11:28
As far as how buses are assigned to different divisions, yeah, that's not something that we do.

Packet Pg. 151

1.E.3.f

11:36
We just assign the vehicle assignments based upon the route and ridership demands.
11:42
OK Is there anyone outside service development here not that handles the how the buses are
assigned to the different divisions?

12:02
Is there AQ and A here?
12:06
I don't see a chat here.
12:07
I could I don't see AQ and A why don't you give me your contact information and I will have them
contact you.
12:14
OK, 303-350-8620 OK.
12:27
And it's and you're Eric.
12:29
What's your last name?
12:30
Eric MANNINO.
12:34
OK.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

11:52
OK who would have to call and where that if you want to put your contact info in one of the chats
maybe.

12:35
I've never questioned about the SOP about the four O2L are going to reduce.
12:41
Why is construction be done Hwy.
12:42
85 and when you're going to do 4 tool implementation of the SOP?

Packet Pg. 152

1.E.3.f

12:50
I don't know anything about the four O2L.
12:51
Do you Sam, think?

13:10
I don't know when anything for that is planned.
13:13
Nothing.
13:14
We'll talk about the four O 2.
13:15
Well, four O2, four O 2.
13:17
Yeah, that's what I'm looking at.
13:18
So the only changes on the SOP are to increase to modify the weekend span of service from 8:00 AM
to 8:00 PM, but there will not be any changes for weekday.
13:31
OK.
13:31
What about the, is a moment going to happen after the USD Five construction center when the bus
stops come back on Santa Fe?
13:45
I'm Yeah, I would imagine once construction is finished that those whatever bus stops are affected by
construction will be reopened.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

13:02
OK, so it looks like according to the SOP, we will expand the span of service on the weekends.

13:54
OK.
13:55
Well, I hope, yeah, we hope all the 30 fours can move to Longmont.

Packet Pg. 153

1.E.3.f

14:08
Yeah, we're.
14:09
So if we we can have the the person who is responsible for fleet reach out to you and answer that
question.

14:21
I'll probably be available tomorrow.
14:22
Who should I call for the fleet manager?
14:25
So Tegan, I wouldn't need to find out who it is exactly.
14:30
I know who it used to be, but we've had some shifting of staff, so I need to.
14:36
I will e-mail them your contact information to call you.
14:40
OK.
14:40
But I'm not available.
14:41
Tonight's a problem.
14:43
It would, it would be probably tomorrow.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

14:18
Well, OK, but I'm not available for us tonight.

14:45
Yeah, probably.
14:47
Well, I hope the full 3 be restored.
14:49
Will be restored to the service for the SOP, maybe added for the SOP.

Packet Pg. 154

1.E.3.f

14:53
Full 3.
14:57
Are you talking are you saying 403 route?

15:01
I don't know, I don't see that on here for SOP and I'm not familiar with that route.
15:07
It might have been a route before my time at RTD.
15:10
Actually it was a route before COVID.
15:13
OK.
15:13
So we discontinued it just before COVID.
15:18
I thought you guys wanted to keep the four O 3 bus line and suspended during COVID.
15:24
I would have to look at the SOP, but well it says it says it wasn't including the SOP, but it might come
back after the SOP.
15:36
I would we could add Dan to the group that was his route.
15:40
OK, can you please add Dan to OK, I'll leave and ask Dan or somebody from West team to come over.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

14:59
Yes.

15:46
Sam.
15:47
OK, OK.
16:01
Thanks for taking.

Packet Pg. 155

1.E.3.f

16:03
Sure.
16:06
So I had a couple questions on the D line and H line.

16:16
I'll check my Yeah, it's just minor adjustments primarily.
16:22
I needed to shift some and add some time for the trains to get through what we call the Cascades.
16:27
So from the Aurora Colfax station to the Theater District Convention Center station, it we're still
coordinating and working with City of Denver, but the timing for the signals is not ideal.
16:45
We used to be able to go bi directionally through there and sometimes we can and sometimes we
can't.
16:53
So I'm trying to give trains a little bit more time to get through that intersection to make sure that
they can hopefully start their southbound trip on time.
17:02
So is the hope?
17:04
Yeah, that makes sense.
17:06
Does that affect the spacing in time between those trains?

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

16:09
It looked like they're just listed for I think just minor schedule adjustments at this stage.

17:11
It does.
17:12
So when I have to add a little bit of time, it changes how everything in the entire system has to work.
17:19
So 'cause then, you know, D&H they intersect with or they are run, they share stations with the E line.

Packet Pg. 156

1.E.3.f

17:27
So then the E line has to shift and I have to make sure that the E line shifts around the West line 'cause
I needed to take a little bit of time off the West line outbound because my operators were running a
little early.

17:46
So there's no like, let me just add a minute here without changing the entire system pretty much for
sure.
17:52
But I, I guess with both of those lines sharing the, the downtown loop, do they still maintain like
roughly consistent spacing?
18:02
Yeah, through the through the loop, Yeah, it should be the minute and a half to three minutes for the
traffic signal timing to get through downtown.
18:12
And then the last question with those is, I'm curious why one or well both wouldn't work, but why one
of those is not combined with the L line?
18:23
It seems like that would save at least one operator per hour and lead to better align connectivity at I25 and Broadway.
18:32
I just want to understand that a little bit better.
18:35
I've proposed to combine it with something, but right now the focus is SOP.
18:43
Yeah.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

17:41
And, and when you change the E&H, it changes the R line.

18:44
So I'm hoping maybe with the next round of SOP that we'll be working on that I can integrate it,
especially since after the downtown rail replacement phase two, I'm hoping maybe I can reimplement
some kind of combination to absorb the Li.
19:03
Yeah, it's my help.

Packet Pg. 157

1.E.3.f

19:07
But, you know, I have to submit a proposal and then it has to work its way up the chain for approval.
19:11
So.

19:13
So if it's not in the SOP, it's hard to prioritize even if there would be resource savings.
19:18
Yeah, that's good to know.
19:26
Any other questions?
19:28
It's everything I had for questions.
19:30
That's it.
19:31
That's yeah, for for this round.
19:34
All right, Usually you have more questions, but OK, I I just moved so I'm I'm learning the new the new
lines around me and what to what I need to talk about them now.
19:45
OK, that's fair.
19:49
All right.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

19:12
Got it.

19:49
Well, then if that's good, then I guess I'll go back to the room and then you can either leave or go
back to the main room if something pops in your head for another group.
20:01
Yeah, I guess while I have you here.

Packet Pg. 158

1.E.3.f

20:04
Yeah, not run out of questions as far as the maintenance work goes on the.
20:12
Well, I guess on the DE and H, are any of the schedule adjustments matching what you're seeing in
real time on these lines or are you hoping that?

20:24
I'm really hoping that we continue to see improvement, especially with some of the work that we're
still doing and planning to do.
20:34
The night crews are out there nightly doing as much as they can with hand grinders and replacing and
mitigating what they can without the the big grinder machine here.
20:47
So my help is by this May run board, we're back to what was somewhat normal.
20:55
You think that fingers crossed means January 2024 timing?
21:03
Yeah, but better because I took the Jan 24 running times where we were running at like 80, mid 80s,
high 80s and used that data to inform May to hopefully get us closer to the 90% on time
performance.
21:18
Yeah, it's my help.
21:22
Well, it seems like we have fewer dropped runs now than we did in in January of last year.
21:26
So that's hopefully meaning that better on time plus more continued fewer drop runs will be really
nice.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

20:21
We'll continue to see improvement on trip times.

21:35
I mean, I, I'm always seeing students out there, so I I'm assuming your recruiting is going better.
21:42
Yeah, that's good news.

Packet Pg. 159

1.E.3.f

21:44
Yeah, Yeah.
21:46
And then one positive comment.

21:53
That seemed like a a very welcome addition.
21:56
Yeah, it, it was requested a lot, but it's really hard to support it when there were only like 30 people.
22:03
So once we got up to like 90 boardings, that allows me to add the additional trip.
22:08
Yeah, you have to see that in the, I guess what previously would have been the second or last trip.
22:13
Would that be a 1056?
22:15
Yeah.
22:20
Oh, sorry, I do have one more question.
22:22
I just didn't write this one down on my list.
22:26
A lot of the frequency improvements have been really nice to see.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

21:48
I just enjoyed seeing the late Friday trip on the end line.

22:30
And talking with Jesse about the 16, it sounded like it hit the threshold to go to 10 minute frequencies
on boardings per hour.
22:39
And given that, I'm really curious why the A line, which seems like it's well above the boardings per
hour threshold that you would need for 10 minute frequencies is still running at 30 minutes in the
evenings.

Packet Pg. 160

1.E.3.f

22:51
So that's where working with a concessionaire who runs the A line is different.
23:02
Any kind of changes to the schedule as far as frequency or changing the timing requires negotiations
of the concessionaires agreement.

23:27
The weekends is the main area where the boardings per hour threshold is met.
23:32
And so by adding a car, we can put off the increasing frequency.
23:40
I would like to increase frequency, but it's not going to be cheap.
23:43
Yeah, yeah, just seems hard to watch the Pena, Pena Blvd.
23:49
widening studies knowing that there's at least a short term solution available if we're willing to spend
the money and remember to, to pitch in.
24:00
But no, no, I'll, I'll remain hopeful that we can at least go to 15 on, on some of those.
24:06
Yeah, 15 I think is the most frequent that you could do because it is single track right now from 40th
and Airport to Pena and then between Pena and Denver airport, from 48th and airport all the way to
the airport.
24:24
Is, is that 100% on airport property?

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

23:14
And at the time, right now we're meeting the need by taking adding additional cars to those trains in
the evening on the weekends.

24:28
It's not RTD, no, I, I don't know the exact.
24:38
I wasn't here for the planning and design of all that.
24:40
So I'm not familiar with all of the boundaries, but I think a good share of it is mostly airport property.

Packet Pg. 161

1.E.3.f

24:48
Yeah, I, I dug in a while back on how the, I can't remember the, the name for them, but the fees that
the airport is allowed to charge airlines, which is capped up to, you know, single digit dollars per per
passenger basically, and how they can use that for transportation improvements.
25:06
And there seem to be this sweet spot that since so much of the single track was, looked like it was on
airport property, that they could potentially use some of that funding to improve it, even though
there's more than one stop.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

25:19
Maybe.
25:20
I haven't looked into it.
25:21
Yeah.
25:22
That's something to pressure the airport on, though.
25:25
Yeah.
25:26
Reach out to Phil Washington.
25:33
But I have one just very general question too.
25:35
If you still have time when you're when we're talking about boardings per hour, is that implicitly a
boardings per hour per trip?
25:44
It's not just total, total boardings on the route over a one hour period.
25:50
Does it you get normalized by like if you had one trip per hour and you know, 400 boardings in that
time span versus 2 trips per hour and 400 mornings in that time span would be called the two trips
per hour, 1200 boardings per hour?
26:10
Well, it's not really by the trip, it's by the revenue hours.

Packet Pg. 162

1.E.3.f

26:14
So when we're calculating it, it's you know, the length of the trip and then how many trips make up
that service divided by the boardings.
26:25
So if you double the service frequency, you're also doubling revenue hours and off run times.

26:32
OK, yeah.
26:34
So it's not necessarily always a double, but it's it depends on how the cycle time for the route works.
26:43
So you know, the cycle time is the running time from start to end, plus any dead head and layover
recovery for the operator impact cycle time that you can achieve based off of the frequency.
26:58
So yeah, like it takes 9 E lines to run the E line service.
27:04
So OK, I'll have to rework the calcs I have in my, the database I've been building.
27:15
Cause I've been looking at purely how many people get on a given route at any stop over the span of
any one hour.
27:22
And it's in, it's in the hundreds for a lot of these routes, which is not consistent with like the, the
documentation I've seen for, for how you plan things.
27:30
So I'm trying to figure out where, where I'm missing something.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

26:30
You are, yes.

27:33
And I, I think the, it's the fact that, you know, 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM is not one revenue hour.
27:41
It's however many revenue hours that you get by, however many vehicles are running on that route,
right?
27:48
So it's whatever your cycle time is times however many vehicles it takes.

Packet Pg. 163

1.E.3.f

27:52
So like the E line is for example, it's an hour each direction.
28:00
Operators take 9 minutes to turn it each direction.

28:16
So however many 9 trains times 15 minutes is and then that's that could give you a rough estimate for
revenue hours.
28:24
Yeah, that makes sense.
28:26
But they also post them online, I think on in like the finance pages when they do their financial
reports.
28:33
You could get revenue hours from there.
28:35
I haven't seen it by route other than for maybe for the the rail, but definitely not by route for buses.
28:41
OK.
28:42
That's why I've been trying to do some of my own data.
28:47
Good luck.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

28:03
So that's an hour plus those 18 minutes plus their layover recovery time comes to like a cycle time of
like 135 or something like that, I don't remember off the top of my head.

28:53
OK, Any more?
28:56
I think that's that's actually the last one.
28:59
OK, cool.

Packet Pg. 164

1.E.3.f

29:01
I'm going to go back to the big group then.
29:04
Yeah, hopefully continue to get some good questions tonight.

29:09
Thanks again for doing this.
29:11
Yeah, have a good night.
29:13
Yes, thanks.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

29:07
Yeah, for sure.

Packet Pg. 165

1.E.3.f

Ask a planner
0:02
As opposed to routes that might have some higher ridership with 15 minute frequencies as well like
the the 1:05 or certain off peak times on the 15 or 15 L?

0:19
So you probably remember back in September 23 or when we took, we did the first changes on the
16, we broke it into 16 and the 17 and we added 15 minute service frequency.
0:30
Since then, the ridership on the 16, I'm not sure if you know this or not, but the overall ridership is
showing 40 boardings per hour on the overall route, which was our former, you know, a floor for a
route receiving 10 minute frequency.
0:46
So during what I call peak direction times, we get up to 48 boardings, 48.6 boardings per hour on the
route 16.
0:56
So it is actually doing extremely well, which encourages us to increase the ridership.
1:02
And what's different about let's say the 1515 L, which the last numbers I looked at, they were in the
high 30s, They operate on higher frequencies, but they also share 1/4, right.
1:13
You might remember the 16 and 16 L, which we no longer have.
1:17
We don't have the 16 L anymore.
1:19
So with the 16, we're actually, it's not that we're doing a disservice to the corridor itself, but the
corridor could use more service and that is different than what's in the current SOP.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

0:14
Awesome, great, great question and I truly appreciate it.

1:30
And that's why we're asking the board to amend the current SOP for the Route 16 that ridership is, it's
doing very, very well.
1:39
Route one O 5, I'm glad you mentioned that it does deserve a higher frequency.

Packet Pg. 166

1.E.3.f

1:44
We'll be revisiting that again.
1:45
But you might remember also, we just changed the Route one O 5 earlier last year to the higher all
day midday frequency.

2:01
So there we think we have a little room there.
2:03
Will we be back and revisiting the Route one O 5?
2:05
I do believe so.
2:06
I think it's going to reach that 40 plus boardings per hour to be absolutely honest.
2:11
So yeah, I, I think we're, we're on the same page.
2:16
I look forward to seeing what the 16 is actually going to do at the 10 minute level.
2:21
OK.
2:21
Does that answer your questions that that does and that boardings per hour, is that something you
look at over the entire span of the route?

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

1:53
And then we came back in January with Route 35, which shares a corridor with the Route one O 5 on
Hampden.

2:32
We can look at it.
2:33
We look at it in several different ways.
2:34
We look at it from the raw route.

Packet Pg. 167

1.E.3.f

2:37
So that's the old when I say overall 40, that's the score that the route must meet in order to hold on to
10 minutes service frequency for the entire route at the segment exceeds that.
2:49
We can look at it for that time period.

2:56
However, because it's the overall in their, in their non typical times in which we're exceeding the 4548
boardings per hour, it gives us all the confidence in the world to say that, OK, this makes sense to
have midday peak frequency and we we can go there and actually grow the ridership.
3:16
At the same time, when we looked at the overall balance of the of the Service plan itself, the 16 is in a
unique position in that it's a core route that's very important to transfers throughout the system and it
crosses some very meaningful or larger routes as well.
3:34
So we think that it's a pretty big benefit to the, to the network as a whole.
3:43
How do you weigh those qualitative impacts when you're comparing different routes?
3:50
Say you have two routes that both meet that 40 boardings per hour metric.
3:54
But yeah, then it comes down to opportunity.
3:57
You know, Joe, the system is a lot more complicated in terms of where we dispatch the vehicles from.
4:03
So we're looking at different divisions in different parts of town.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

2:51
So if let's say AM peak and PMP meets it, we can, you know, grab the 10 minute frequency.

4:06
We're looking at different contracts that we have with private carriers.
4:09
We have limitations on certain contracts.
4:11
We we have to provide a balance.

Packet Pg. 168

1.E.3.f

4:13
So what what provides us the best opportunity based on our workforce and the divisions that the
services are out of.

4:38
Had they also had an additional flexibility of saying, OK, we're going to go ahead and make this move
with the 16 to 10 minute frequency there with a 40 foot coach, which means I can then free up
articulated coaches and not have to think about that to reserve, you know, put in reserve for that, but
instead think about that for future changes on the federal BRT quarter.
5:01
So there there are a lot of things that go into it and that's those are the harder things to really talk
about and to kind of enumerate in a in a report.
5:10
But there are things that we have to that we would want to take advantage of when we can to lower
our cost, increase frequency and then serve the customer as best we can.
5:19
Thanks.
5:20
Yeah, I appreciate all the the detail there.
5:22
OK, What other routes did you have?
5:25
Just to make sure that there wasn't anything else for North team, The D&H, the 12 and the Metro ride.
5:36
OK, I'll take the Metro ride.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

4:21
And it can even go down to with their future plans, like in this case, if there are future plans to not
address things with let's say an articulated coach, which is our our longer vehicle making a move like
this.

5:39
We'll knock out all the ones.
5:40
We'll see if we can find one of our rail folks for you.
5:42

Packet Pg. 169

1.E.3.f

But the Metro ride, so you might remember back when we did phase one of the downtown rail
reconstruction project.
5:51
So we brought the free Metro ride back all day, this service all day as a mitigation effort to provide,
you know, more service since we are not full bore with a free mall ride still under construction and
quite frankly, it's still under construction.

6:13
But knowing that the free metro arrived was supposed to be a part of the SOP, supposed to be a
permanent part.
6:20
Looking at the ridership, what we learned is the midday just wasn't there in terms of the number of
passengers per hour during midday.
6:27
So we're bringing back in the configuration that's more consistent with what we believe will make
sense from a permanent basis.
6:36
So this isn't just a mitigation effort.
6:39
This is the permanent replacement or permanent reimplementation of the the free Metro Ride.
6:45
I see.
6:45
OK.
6:46
And with so many buses already traversing the downtown corridor between Civic Center and Union
Station, is there any reason that those existing routes can't be reconfigured to serve the same niche as
the Metro ride?

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

6:08
So I'm we hope that September is the date that it does come back.

6:59
Not without the impacts that are expected to, you know, to the customers who are currently using
those.
7:07
So I think it's better to, and this is again, my opinion and there's certainly a world out there who may
differ in opinion, but we're trying to re establish in the downtown area.

Packet Pg. 170

1.E.3.f

7:17
And you, you probably know this better than than most.
7:20
That is downtown isn't what it used to be in terms of employment population.

7:35
At the same time we have this dedicated fleet, the free metro ride, you may know as a three door
articulated coach with no fare box, right.
7:43
So that's part of our fleet that isn't as flexible as as other services.
7:48
So we think the investment and putting it back in the quarter that it was built for is that we did build a
corridor the 18th and 19th area for the free, free metro ride.
7:58
We think that that's a viable quarter to stave off some other things that we we may not be able to
justify as far as reinstatement.
8:09
So you might remember, and not only I know she does.
8:12
And looking at the 120X and 122X122X actually served the southern end of downtown.
8:18
It has not been reinstated with a free metro ride that keeps us from having to, you know, to take a
look at reinstating the 122 X until you know, it's, it's until the market is, is back.
8:32
And quite frankly, Joe, I, I'm not sure that downtown is going to come back to the level of
employment population as it was prior to pandemic.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

7:26
So we're trying to hold on and preserve what we have as far as ridership and travel patterns that are
there and we don't want to necessarily disrupt them.

8:43
I just, I, I'm not seeing that.
8:45
And it's been, it's been five years.

Packet Pg. 171

1.E.3.f

8:48
It literally has been fighting.
8:49
We're coming up on five years now.

9:01
And if that's the case and if that continues, then we're going to have to modify some things.
9:04
I think the free metro ride during peak period will provide an alternative way of getting to the
southern end of downtown and the best way that we possibly can can bring it and utilizing a fleet
that, you know, if we don't use it now, we'll we'll have bought an asset that's been useless for a very
long period of time, if that makes sense.
9:28
Yeah, that does.
9:29
Thank you.
9:32
And the Route 12.
9:34
Route 12 is there's a timing issue that I believe was brought up in the public hearing process from
January and we're addressing the Route 12's connections at 30th and Blake.
9:43
So that was that is purely a timing issue.
9:45
I'm I'm super happy to see that issue get addressed.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

8:51
So I think we've seen growth in the downtown employment area of like 445 percent from, you know,
what it what it has been since 2020.

9:49
I was mostly curious if addressing the issue with the 38th and Blake connection will have negative
impacts on the enh line connection at Louisiana Pearl.
9:59
Yeah, I'm hoping those can be maintained.
10:01

Packet Pg. 172

1.E.3.f

Yeah, I'm hoping that our our biggest issues as far as I will and I'm sure you'll probably hear this from
Tegan and Clara are the work schedule.
10:08
Those that you know have to be joined in in order to cure some of the infrastructure problems that we
have right now.

10:24
Then we have overhead wire issues that will have to be addressed.
10:27
So this this comes with, I can remember when we just had the central corridor, wrote the first
operations plan for the central corridor, the first schedules.
10:38
And I can't imagine, I couldn't have imagined one being here for 30 some odd years.
10:44
But it happened.
10:45
And now the system is over 30 years old and needs some real help.
10:51
And it's we have a lot of work that needs to be done.
10:55
So there are scheduled irregularities, as you know, still out there as we do slow orders and we do
shutdowns.
11:01
And some of the shutdowns are now lasting from like 2:00 AM in the morning until about noon the
next day in order to get certain work done.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

10:15
As far as straightening out rail, replacing rail in some parts and milling rail where there are, you know,
rust spots or other other problems.

11:07
So I, I, I do hope that we won't ruin any connections as far as Louisiana, but we still have a lot of work.
11:14
And I do know that in the next few weeks, we are going to start working on the area between South
Moor and Broadway.
11:21
Again, a bit of work that needs to be done there.

Packet Pg. 173

1.E.3.f

11:24
So I can't guarantee anything at this point in time, but we're definitely trying to cure the issue
between the 12 at 30th and Blake.

11:50
So brace for impact and stay a customer if you can, please.
11:56
Yeah, All right.
11:59
Thanks for the detail.
12:00
Further questions.
12:02
Yeah, Thank you for for, you know, joining and asking.
12:06
We can't fix it if we don't know about it.
12:08
So we appreciate it.
12:11
Yeah.
12:11
If there's nothing else, then I'll go ahead and stop the recording for this session.

Attachment: Attachment F - Public Comment (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

11:33
As far as the A line is concerned, for sure we're going to do our best connections and on time
performance on the the E and the and the H, But as you know, we probably have another Phase 2
coming up later this year.

12:14
We can get back into the main room.
12:17
OK.
12:17
And everyone, the way that you get back to the room is to your right side.

Category: Schedule Timing
Change: Minor changes to schedule.
Reason: Improve on-time performance and service reliability.
Please expand the service area of the Ridgeline station to include Castle Pines. I am a college student at MSU
living in CP who uses the Ridgeline station to get to campus and I do not apply for in-district free parking. It would
be very financially beneficial if people in my neighborhood would apply for free parking when we have to use the
light rail everyday.
Having more reliable times for the line would be good. I also think better integration with Google maps would be
good.

How am I supposed to know if you don’t tell me what the changes are? Dumb survey.
Can there be on time ever?
Go every 20 till 7pm instead of cut off at 6:30pm for Eline.

Really tired of changes to this line. Every change causes negative impact that is unacceptable. Ever since the
COVID shutdown things have been horrible and with the last two summers of maintenance that last 6 to 9 months
before schedules are back, it is ridiculous. When are you people going to get it together. Every major city in the
US except here have a great mass transit system. What is wrong here. Fire the CEO and start a clean slate!! This
sucks you run 2 to 3 cars going downtown and it was always 4 prior to COVID. We are packed in these trains like
sardines. Stop the madness.
I'd love this to be reliable, but it hasn't been for like a year now. It will take time for me to regain trust in RTD's
timeliness.
We use this Lightrail route to go to sporting events
The on-time proposal would be great as we didn't go to the home and garden show this year because of the
inconsistency of the E line operators and the hours of operation. You can't expect people to use light rail if they
can't depend on the overall operation. Plus make sure the line is safe for us to us by RTD Police on the line
checking for tickets and behavior.
The schedule changes should either reflect the real time that it normally gets to stations, or move as quickly as
reasonably possible, while also allowing other bus routes to easily get on or depart from a rail station along the Eline.
I use this line to commute to work as a professor at MSU. Increased reliability will drastically improve my work life
balance and ability to get to class reliably and on time.
RTD needs to return to pre-covid schedules on ALL lines. E, G, and B. RTD needs to finish the FastTrax
approved B line to Boudler Longmont. AND realize that the time for maintenance is when there are no trains. Not
during the peak time for commuting!!!!!
I am happy if the E line service is not being reduced. Slow zones seem to be getting better!

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Fire the entire RTD Board and start over - clueless. !

I would have liked to have seen the actual proposed schedule change, the text provided doesn't give any
information, and now I just get to worry that my layover at union station during my commute will be longer.
It's ridiculous don't even know when the trains are actually going to be there, can't count on rtd at all to be
anywhere on time and why should we pay for passes when the drivers all let people ride for free. It's getting really
old when I barely can live and still have to pay for a pass and all these junkies and homeless people get to ride for
free everyday all day long. Rtd is pathetic and dangerous. You don't do anything about the drug use and drug
deals going on at colorado station and all stations really your security is non existent. Rtd is just all around
pathetic no wo Der nobody wants to ride and it sucks for us that have to ride it.

Packet Pg. 179

I used to ride E/H from university to work downtown and back every day. Starting about 8 months ago it became
so unreliable that I no longer use RTD. Trains have been 40+ minutes late compared to estimated times on the
RTD app and google maps.
no matter what times you change it to there is NEVER on an on time train. its also 15-20 minutes late which
defeats the whole purpose. the 11 train is always arrives at 1130 and so on.

The change will positively impact me if the times run in closer sync with connecting trains.
I think the main priority should be trains that do not have to sit and wait between stops because of a traffic jam in
front of them. Trains every 15 minutes is nice, but more trains doesn’t make a difference when those trains arrive
very late at their destination.
The E line is how I get to and from my job. Don't have a car so it’s important. I have been leaving my home and
arriving at work super early. If I leave when google maps says I should I’m frequently late. Sometime very late. So
reliability and on time service is very important to me and everyone who rides rtd
Not a reliable option. Bring back the F line!
Minor changes to the schedule are fine as long as the number of trains per hour remains consistent and
predictable. Especially during the morning and evening commuting times.
E line needs improved security due to violent untreated mental health patients often on the train
Please plan accordingly so we do not have construction sites scattered without a promising competition date.
It’s impossible to tell what the schedule changes are so I can’t provide feedback. It just says “minor schedule
changes”
E Line is my main source of transportation to arrive to work on time everyday.
I like the concept, but where are the details? I ride between University of Denver and union Station. NB between 7
and 7:30. SB sometime between 3:30 and 4:00. Since I can’t depend on a reliable schedule. I am forced to wait,
up to 30 minutes for a train. That is a waste of time. I would prefer to have a reliable schedule rather than more
frequent service.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Right now the e line south gets to Colorado station early 7:02 vs 7:05 and then will leave the station early and
then sits on the track 100 yards south of the station. Why leave early just to sit on the tracks for a few min? Why
not stay at the station? The south bound slow down goes from Colorado station to just after Southmoor on the
map it only shows the slow down between Yale and Southmoor

If it means the posted times are the actual that would be great!!
Could use more E line
If you want feedback on the change, then say what the change is to the schedule on the E Line. “Minor changes”
says nothing.

If this solves the "Trip is delayed due to excessive delay". "Next 4 trains cancelled due to excessive delay", issue
on Mondays between 8 and 10 am, great. Otherwise, you're not improving anything.
I do t know what the point of this survey is if all the changes are vague promises of improvements. You should be
improving your services anyway, they are terrible.
Any reduction in schedule for the summer will impact my ability to get to work. I am riding 3 days a week now and
need to during the summer. Just when the schedule get better and you hire drivers you want to reduce it again.
Constantly changing schedules is killing ridership.

Would just like reliable lines to be able to get to work on time. Would like to go back to every 15 minutes so a late
or nonexistent train isn’t end all be all
I would like to see a guaranteed transfer or cross platform interchange between D/E lines at I-25/Broadway
(Or better yet, a peak hour 1 seat ride from Littleton to Union Station)
Need more frequent and on time trains.
In order to have an opinion, it would be helpful to see the new proposed schedule, instead of simply noting “minor
changes to schedule.” Overall, regardless of the schedule change, I really urge RTD to run larger/longer trains (I.e
three cars instead of two) during typical rush hour periods (I.e 6am-9am and 4pm-6pm) so that trains aren’t
packed during high volume periods. I’d also encourage RTD to start routinely checking for tickets while trains are
en route - I take the E Line regularly and haven’t been checked in ~5 months. I guarantee at least half of riders
aren’t consistently paying.
It would be best to know how this change will look in practice. Are goal times getting adjusted? If so, earlier or
later? For me this would affect when i leave the house. It could also impact transfers (a couple minutes later and a
small delay from maintenance would lead to missing my transfer for example)
Generally speaking though more accurate to schedule is better, so im thankful efforts are being made to make
that happen!
Sometimes I take the E after taking the Flatiron Flyer to Union Station, hopefully this means Les waiting at the
platform.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Is there more detail somewhere beyond "minor changes to schedule"? Hard to know what the impact is otherwise

Depends on what the changes are but if the changes mean the train will show up at the time wits supposed to
and makes it to where it's supposed to on time and is a line that makes sense for workers that work downtown
commuting from Littleton then yes that seems positive (again nothing is provided on what the actual change is) bring back the direct train from downtown Littleton to Union station
More frequent service would be great
I appreciate that almost all of the speed restrictions have been lifted. I’ve experienced improved service.
Can you be more specific? The description is not helpful at all trying to understand how this will impact me - I
understand it’s minor, but is it just when the train is coming, or is it the headway? Just provide more details please

Keep the 15 minute frequency. Appreciate the recent work with reducing slow zones, every 15 minutes is such a
benefit over every 30.
I regularly ride the 24 to catch the E line, but I am never able to ride the 24 back home because the schedules
don’t overlap well. I hope these changes will give me an easier commute after work.
Positive if it actually improves on time performance.

Can the 15 minute frequency for the E Line be extended later? Currently it only goes to 5:30/6pm. This is still
within rush hour. If 15 minute headways were maintained till 7 or 8 it would make it much more useful in the
summer, especially with longer stretches of daylight.
How can anyone comment when the exact timing issue isn’t disclosed??? A minor change by RTD could be once
an hour service. Absurd that there is no full disclosure especially with the poor track record of Rtd.
Make it more frequent in the morning please and on time.
I go between work and classes at MSU Denver and being able to submit schedules to my work so they know my
availability would drastically improve my quality of life
The details say there are minor changes but it does not specify what those changes are so how do I know
whether it impacts me or not?
All of the rail and BRT lines should be given priority over everything else, especially right now. Finish the BRT
lines ASAP, so we can get the remainder of the changes for these rail lines completed, and service times
increased to potentially 10 minute intervals vs 15 even, especially along the N, W, H, D, F, & E lines respectively.
Any change to improve reliability without affecting frequency will be helpful
The light rail needs to run later on weekends and on any Colorado game day. And any concert nights. I like taking
the light rail but if go to a concert we have to uber home Becasue the e line does not go late enough.
Reliability and frequency will make my commute quicker and consistent for transfers. I have not used rtd because
it’s not reliable.

If it really improves on time performance and service reliability it will be great. I've been very frustrated by
unreliable for the past year.

I would rather you have the train tracks fully fixed and have operators to staff all routes before making any
changes. To me those items are more important before anything else.
The schedule timing needs to be a little bit better
It would be much appreciated if Southbound D & E line trips would resume the practice of scheduling back-toback arrival at I-25/Broadway station and pausing to allow for riders to transfer between the lines.
There are no details about the actual changes so it’s not possible to know how these will impact me and my
ridership. Please make the changes easier to find. Don’t just say what you’re changing, say how you’re changing.
For example, RTD say, “minor changes to schedule,” without giving a list of what those changes are.

The biggest issue is that E departs outside of it’s posted service window, often early. If it says it’s leaving at X
time, that should be the earliest it departs at. If it arrives early, it should wait until it’s scheduled departure. It’s
been great that it’s running every 15 again.

I am a proponent for the C line returning. If you are looking to increase ridership, provide The SW communities
with direct service to sporting events, LoDo entertainment venues and a direct connect to the A line. Anyone
traveling to DIA switching at the Broadway station w/a suitcase won’t feel safe hanging out at the Broadway
station w/o security. I don’t understand how RTD will increase ridership 30% w/o returning the C line which was
pulled during the pandemic. Have you surveyed the SW communities about the C line service? How was ridership
summer 2024?

make sure rail changes are communicated and light rail is on time. Needs during rush hour every 15 minutes.
Run shuttle buses to 18th and Curtis.
This line has been very unreliable recently. During construction when the d line was redirected it was nice that
there was a line that there was a train that went directly to Union. I wish rtd would reintroduce a train that goes
from mineral station to Union. It would be awesome if they planned ahead for events like Rockies games or other
sporting events

The changes will positively impact me if they are timed better with other trains. For example, I don't have to wait
for 15 or 20 minutes on the southbound Broadway platform at night in the bitter cold after stepping off a
southbound e train. Allow these trains to run until 1AM since a lot of people are returning home super late after a
concert gets out. Since the C train is gone, those of us returning from downtown to Littleton have to take the
southbound E or H train In order to catch the southbound D train. I got out of the Rolling Stones concert well after
11PM last July and was lucky to get back to Littleton on one of the last trains. That experience made me feel like
RTD is unreliable for concerts if it's going stop service at 12 midnight. RTD should be running trains until 1AM on
nights of big concerts at Empower Field or Ballerina. There's really not another affordable alternative.

D line should go to Union Station so that riders can connect to other lines
Please organize accordingly so we do not have construction sights scattered through downtown with unpromised
dates of completion.
Please keep them on time! They have been so unreliable for a year
Could be more consistent
Wtf are the changes?
Anything you can do to improve reliability. Special event schedules are an absolute mystery. What games count?
What holidays count? The website is impossible to navigate and the light up signs are wrong half the time and
only provide limited information
Any reduction in schedule for the summer will impact my ability to get to work. I am riding 3 days a week now and
need to during the summer. Just when the schedule get better and you hire drivers you want to reduce it again.
Constantly changing schedules is killing ridership.
Things have finally been on time and consistent for the D line, please don't make any drastic changes!
Please bring back the C line
I would like to see a guaranteed transfer or cross platform interchange between D/E lines at I-25/Broadway

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Would be nice if there were better connections to get into Union Station from Mineral. Timing is always off going
north and the E doesn’t run all that often. Better yet, bring back the C line!

(Or better yet, a peak hour 1 seat ride from Littleton to Union Station)
Please have this line go all the way to union station!
Whatever the changes are they need to line up the northbound D and OB arrival to Englewood station better. The
OB is always late and the train transfer is missed because of it.
Please do not change the timing of the 5:40am train. It is used by many commuters who start work between 6am6:30am. It allows us to end our day and get on the train before it is crowded with students at the CCD/Auraria
campus

As long as the trains go faster than 10mph by the time the fall semester of school comes around it won’t affect
me. My first semester all the construction started two weeks into the school year which disrupted my travel and
made the light rail unreliable. If it’s done over the summer and doesn’t effect school travel it only benefits me.
Depends on what the changes are but if the changes mean the train will show up at the time wits supposed to
and makes it to where it's supposed to on time and is a line that makes sense for workers that work downtown
commuting from Littleton then yes that seems positive (again nothing is provided on what the actual change is)

Of well over a year I have made attempts to use the D line to get to work downtown however due to the
inconsistencies in schedule and lack of service I have stopped trying. Just takes entirely too long to get to work.
Not to mention the crowding with the college stop and insufficient trains to accommodate those crowds.
The times need to be improved. Especially the late night times. The line should not stop running at 8pm and
strand people.
rtd timing sucks
Your handling. of the maintenance on this line has been horrible and caused me to stop using RTD. It has been
really frustrating and beyond incompetent on RTDs part.
It would be helpful for the E line to arrive at Broadway close to the time the D line drops off at Broadway. I am a
single woman and sometimes I am the only woman waiting for the E line at the Broadway stop to go to Union
Station; others appear to be homeless men during the week. I greatly miss the C line direct from Littleton to Union
Station; the Broadway station always makes me uncomfortable unless there is a security guard there. One time I
was waiting at Broadway on a Sunday and a man who did not seem in his right mind came up to me and started
unzipping his pants. I moved to another location at the station. Friends of mine (women) refuse to ride the trains
because of safety concerns; I have continued to use the trains in spite of the issues but am cautious.
Make sure when going southbound people can make a connection between the e line, and the d line along with
good implementation of the zero
Sure miss the direct train from Littleton to union station. Don’t go to union anymore, I used to enjoy taking the
train.
Bring the C Line back! Even if it would run every 1/2 hr, it would be better than nothing. The Southwest corridor is
being shortchanged. The parking lots used to be so full, it was hard to find a spot. Being back the C Line and
downtown will definitely benefit from the increased patronage.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

Having on time trains and not having randomly missing trains would be a huge improvement

As long as it doesn't increase the time between trains, just adjusting the times it runs and is posted on the app
correctly. That would be ok.
RTD changed in January the schedule so what now needs to be updated??
All of the rail and BRT lines should be given priority over everything else, especially right now. Finish the BRT
lines ASAP, so we can get the remainder of the changes for these rail lines completed, and service times
increased to potentially 10 minute intervals vs 15 even, especially along the N, W, H, D, F, & E lines respectively.

Curious about the proposed changes for transfer reasons.
You also need to consider having the 0 have a 7 minute headway and the 0B have a 15 minute headway.
If the train schedule is disrupted, it would be nice if the RTD app and the digital sign at the station showed an
accurate ETA for when the next train is coming. It is frustrating when the app/signage indicates a train is coming in
the next ten minutes, and then a train never comes, so it just skips to the next scheduled train. If I need to wait
thirty minutes, it is helpful to know that outright.

It would be much appreciated if Southbound D & E line trips would resume the practice of scheduling back-toback arrival at I-25/Broadway station and pausing to allow for riders to transfer between the lines.
There are no details about the actual changes so it’s not possible to know how these will impact me and my
ridership. Please make the changes easier to find. Don’t just say what you’re changing, say how you’re changing.
For example, RTD say, “minor changes to schedule,” without giving a list of what those changes are.
Make sure that D line trains align with E line squedule for better transfer to union station
I would like to see the implementation of a C line to Union station again, or perhaps alternate the D lines so that
every other train on the South-west alignment can function as a “C”. I believe having a route from mineral/union
station would help make transfers easier for patrons to get to the commuter rail lines as well as the West lines.
Otherwise, patrons that utilize the southwest alignment have to wait for an E line in order to get to Union station
and or Aurora west to get to golden.
I will keep saying this for as long as you don't do it. BRING BACK THE C-LINE!! Really, you need to. People
going to Union Station from Englewood and Littleton should not be forced to change trains at I-25 & Broadway.
And here's another idea, come up with a new light rail line that goes from Mineral Station to Peoria Station, which
I know is doable as you currently have one track that goes up to the bridge over the Broadway from Evans
Station. This would give Englewood and Littleton a fast connection to the University of Denver, Aurora, and the
airport. Yes it would bypass I-25 & Broadway but they have a line that goes there, it's not a problem.
I seek leadership to fund the southwest rail extension to C-470 and Lucent Blvd while I seek leadership to reroute
D Line service to Union Station with RTD route 402L SOP being implemented Monday-Saturday except modify
SOP route 402L Sunday service from 9AM-6PM due to low ridership and underutilization outside of the current
weekend hours before SOP implementation of route 402L. I also seek leadership of the second phase of route
402L SOP implementation of weekend service being discontinued in May 2027 due to low ridership and
underutilization on weekends. Lastly I seek leadership for a May 2028 target for opening of the D Line Extension
to C-470 & Lucent Blvd with D Line service being increased to 10 minutes 7 days a week by AM and PM peak
service being increased to 5 minutes bi-directionally, also funding for BRT service down Broadway to replace
routes 0B, 0, and 0L with service on weekdays and weekends from town center to Union Station and Civic Center
Station by naming the lines Red Line (Town Center to Union Station 5 minute frequency by rerouting it down
highlands ranch Pkwy to Broadway) Yellow Line (Town Center to Civic Center Station (same frequency and route
as Red Line)) with the implementation of d line Extension to C-470 & Lucent Blvd in May 2028 by discontinuing

This ride is safer, and it has less stops and it runs along the streets where I work. Not having this Free Metro Ride
has a huge impact on getting to and from work.
Bring it back!
Rush hour service would be great!
I really appreciate the implementation of the free metro line to improve connections to federal office given the
RTO taking place. As I live in Broomfield, I’d also really appreciate restarting the FF4 as the FF1 through Union is
much slower for me and the FF1 is getting crowded at peak commute times. Thanks.

Really great while the mallride is not working and the quick commute across downtown to the train and bus
stations.
Please bring back the Free MetroRide. It is convenient for the people who work on 18th. It is also very
inconvenient right now having to walk through the construction on 16th Street. I like that the FMR is more reliable
than the Mall Shuttle.
This is needed as there are people who work on 18th St and North of 18th there are not easy was to get around
the free mall ride on 16th (currently 15 & 17th) gets really crowded and is slowed by the frequency of stops

Please bring back the MetroRide! Thank you!!
I so miss the option of taking the MetroRide and am excited that you're proposing to bring it back! There are not
many options near 18th & Broadway to head to Union Station and this would provide a great option. Thank you!
This route is incredibly more useful than the Mall Ride in its current state. Having this option will enable much
quicker trips to Union Station for rail connections, as well as generally increasing mobility downtown.
We really used the MetroRide in the past and hope you can extend the hours of service.
We live in the northeast edge of downtown (20th and Lincoln) and have no nearby RTD options to go directly to
Union Station to connect with other lines. Please reinstate the Free Metroride AND INCREASE the service to
EVERY day, and ALL day. Thank you.
PS Our area has NO nearby RTD service except for the L line which goes nowhere anyone needs to go!!! Please
reinstate the L line stop at the convention center/theater district. Right now, the L line is pointless!!
I would prefer to take FMR over the 16th street mall ride
Finally! New bus lanes on 18th are underutilized. This change will make it much easier & faster to get from Union
Station to upper downtown. Next step, add more hours.
I am occasionally in downtown Denver during rush hour and this would help getting to and from Union Station.
The metroride is much faster and more convenient than the mall ride.

Attachment: Attachment G - Survey (5093 : May 2025 Service Change)

This would greatly approve my commute experience

I would like it to run all day and not have a break between 9am and 3pm.
This will better connect me to my job during the work week. I missed this service when it was gone.
The MetroRide is such a short distance in the heart of downtown—it should run every 5 minutes to provide true
rapid service. If I miss a bus, it’s faster for me to walk to my destination than wait 10 minutes.
This change would improve my commuting experience and would be a change that rtd made that would be
helpful to my experience. Not something I can say about previous schedule changes.

This service will allow me to return to office and downtown more often if I can more predictably get from Union
Station to Civic Center
Add more trips not just during peak hours
The MetroRide is a very valuable resource for me. I work downtown and with out the MetroRide I have to run
most the time a half a mile to catch a bus when it is not in service. When it is in service I only have to walk a block
to get to union. Plus it's a lot more enjoyable to ride than the 15 or the MallRide.
Yes I want this service back. It will be good for the 20th and welton area. The L line is just not as convenient

I live at 20th and California and it would be so nice to be able to use it to get to Union station.
Thank you for considering reinstating the MetroRide. I work one block south of the capitol building. It takes me
half an hour to get from Union Station to my office relying on the MallRide, and I often feel unsafe. The MetroRide
cuts travel time in half and allows me to worry less about my safety.
Please bring the Metro back! It is much needed for getting from Union Station to the other end of the mall!
Yes! It was so nice having the option in the fall, this perfectly aligns with N line arrivals and cuts my commute
down by 20 mins from Union to the Capitol. Make this permanent!!
I used this service everyday prior to the pandemic. Since the service was cut my commute has been significantly
more challenging. When I heard it was coming back, you cannot believe how excited I was. Unfortunately, the
proposed time windows were a little deflating... I typically dont get to Union station until 9:30am so the 9am cutoff
was unfortunate to hear... please, please, please extend the hours a little bit further into the morning for those
who's workdays dont start until a little later in the morning (thanks in advance)
I strongly support reinstating the Free MetroRide. As a Federal employee who is required to come back to the
office full time, this will substantially help the portion of my commute from Union Station to my office.
I would LOVE to see the free MetroRide service return. My normal route (FF4) was suspended during COVID so I
now take the FF1 to union station and then have to transfer to another bus or walk to get across downtown. The
MetroRide offered a great solution since it runs frequently during peak times making it a great option for
commuters. Additionally it’s faster than the mall ride since it doesn’t stop at every street. The mall ride is great for
people visiting/exploring downtown but the MetroRide is a much better option for commuters and I hope it is
reinstated!

Please increase evening hours to 7pm. Some work a little later.

This is a great idea however why not just allow the 120x bus to take the route of the old 122x which allowed for
downtown drop offs ?
I Love the Free MetroRide because it’s much faster conpared to the Free MallRide but however, it would be much
better to run it on weekends too because it’s acts as an express. route and I used to use it to get from Union To
Civic Center and go to Cherry Creek Shopping mall on weekends! If not, then please bring back the Flatiron Flyer

Happy to have more service later at night, though I don’t usually feel comfortable riding that line after 8PM. I

Adjusting to a later time for the northbound trip really helps me out, and allows me to enjoy time downtown longer.
I ask work downtown and my shift ends at 11pm, and would appreciate an 11:26pm option 7 days a week so I
don't have to park downtown.
Weekend late night trips back north are essential for theater goers like myself. Wednesdays would be nice too.
😁

Thank you for adding an additional late evening trip on Friday nights!
I take the N Line during the week and adding a late Friday night trip from Union Station to Eastlake would be a
nice addition for when people are downtown for shows/games/concerts. I may not personally utilize this new late
Friday night trip often, but would be good to know it's available, if needed.
This will allow me to attend late night events downtown and get home if I stay late.
This is great news and a very welcomed addition.
I generally use this line during commuting hours but any additional service on the N line is much appreciated!
Thank you!
I would add one more time slot 11:56
This is an extremely minor service increase. To get me to rely on the N line more, you would need to move to 15
minute frequencies almost all day. Otherwise, I won’t trust it to reliably get me downtown and back any faster or
more conveniently than driving. As it is because of its minimal schedule, I only use it occasionally and one way if
my wife can drive me home. You spent so much money on the infrastructure only to provide useless headways,
it’s really a ridiculous system. Also, there are too many stops on the N line which makes it needlessly slow, and it
doesn’t go far enough north. You have right of way all the way up to Erie, you should expand it. Ending in a
random parking lot in the middle of a not dense Thornton neighborhood and 3+ miles from I25 is a terrible design.
To connect to other connections especially buses
this allows an option to reach destination for people who might work late or want to attend late events In Denver
an additional option to reach the Thornton Welby stop. Since the 122x is no longer in service. I want to bring back
the 122x back during peak hours and have requested via electronic form but I haven’t seen proposed service
changes, how can I get this on an agenda? It would make what should be a 20 minute ride for many people not
take over an hour to get to Civic Center instead of Union station and then connecting using the free mall ride, and
reduce congestion. Also improve safety from 16th street. Thank you for reading!

Please continue to expand late night trips on the N line. Transit should be running until the bars close to support a
safer way to get home. Later night service will also be impactful for sports games and concerts as those are other
things that go later. I would love to take the train to a concert and not be stranded at the end of the night.

There are several events downtown that I like to attend, especially during the summer, and I always worry about
having to leave an event early so that I don't miss the train.
For the last two years I have ridden the N Line for transportation to entertainment downtown. It would be more
convenient to know there is a later N Line train available.

This will be good- it's always a rush to get to the last train after Friday sporting events
This is very good news.
Increased frequency allows the N-line to become a more integral part of our life in Thornton. This 11:26PM route
will be used instead of driving downtown and back because we can still use the train when stay out late

All of the rail and BRT lines should be given priority over everything else, especially right now. Finish the BRT
lines ASAP, so we can get the remainder of the changes for these rail lines completed, and service times
increased to potentially 10 minute intervals vs 15 even, especially along the N, W, H, D, F, & E lines respectively.
I mean would be cooler if had later options especially for those who like to go downtown and then don't have to
take a $60+ Uber. Do like maybe after 11 one train every hour to help with coverage - also should for morning
weekdays/work commutes do 4 train cars instead of 2. Sometimes cant find a seat... and if your numbers don't
reflect that its because the ticket system is a joke.
Increase sunday service too because people like me go out on sundays to malls and what not 😊
Please make more rides available on the N line
This would be much appreciated.
Please keep investing in the N Line! I'd like to see the last trip depart Union Station at/after 12 AM on Fridays, but
the addition of the 11:26 PM train is a good start.

It's ridiculous don't even know when the trains are actually going to be there, can't count on rtd at all to be
anywhere on time and why should we pay for passes when the drivers all let people ride for free. It's getting really
old when I barely can live and still have to pay for a pass and all these junkies and homeless people get to ride for
free everyday all day long. Rtd is pathetic and dangerous. You don't do anything about the drug use and drug
deals going on at colorado station and all stations really your security is non existent. Rtd is just all around
pathetic no wo Der nobody wants to ride and it sucks for us that have to ride it.

How about improving the H-Line in general. They never are on time, I can wait an hour at station and never see
one H Line train arrive or depart. It's the worst train line and not very dependable at all.
Please plan accordingly so we do not have construction sites scattered without a promising competition date.

Any reduction in schedule for the summer will impact my ability to get to work. I am riding 3 days a week now and
need to during the summer. Just when the schedule get better and you hire drivers you want to reduce it again.
Constantly changing schedules is killing ridership.
Well you didn’t share what the schedule changes would be so I can’t actually answer this
The lack of reliable H trains has had a very significant and negative impact for both my husband and myself. It’s
been terribly frustrating and consequential. Having frequent and on time H trains will make an enormous
difference for us.
Lately this line has been infrequent and undependable. Can't take the light rail to appointments downtown if you
can't count on service.
Half the time the trains take way too long or are missing completely so on time trains would be a huge
improvement
Keep the 15 minute frequency. Appreciate the recent work with reducing slow zones, every 15 minutes is such a
benefit over every 30.

Minor changes to the schedule are fine as long as the number of trains per hour remains consistent and
predictable. Especially during the morning and evening commuting times.

What change?
If it really improves on time performance and service reliability it will be great. I've been very frustrated by
unreliable for the past year.

I would like more information about when the slow downs will be ending.
I’m assuming this will be positive, but just saying “minor changes to schedule” doesn’t actually tell me what the
changes are. I depend on this route to get to my job, so I need assurance that it will be running every 15 minutes
and be reliable
The H line and the Aurora side trains need a LOT of attention, but service frequency also needs to increase.

Reliability and frequency will make my commute quicker and consistent for transfers. I have not used rtd because
it’s not reliable.
Anything you can do to make the trains consistently on time would be great. And every 15 minutes would be
fantastic. I've seen a lot of improvement in the consistency of the H line over the last month, thank you!
H Line has been delayed and cancelled a lot lately, impacting my commute to the Auraria campus. Changes to

For example, RTD say, “minor changes to schedule,” without giving a list of what those changes are.
Please maintain 15-min frequency for as long as possible. I understand these service changes do not incorporate

The details are not mentioned here, so that could be improved. After reviewing the W line changes online, I feel
that it's important to have the W line running to Union station on Sunday nights as well until 2am. I also feel that
the lines should start one hour earlier for those that have lengthy commutes or need to get to Aurora. I utilize the
W line more often than any RTD service, so it is very important that it runs at appropriate times based on
community need. Since it runs so far West I feel it needs longer hours
The w line is always late its super hard to plan for.
We need more time options with less cars

Grateful this line is available in case I miss my main bus which I've had to do recently.
The change will positively impact me if the times are more in sync with connecting trains. Another change you
should be making on the W train is adding more security. I am a single woman who doesn't feel too safe on the W
line. I seldom ride it anymore.
I need to catch the 30/32 SB on federal. I don't care about anything else. I'll stop complaining when I quit missing
my bus by literal seconds after trying to run up tre stairs at Decatur station
It would provide stability in getting to school (Red Rocks Campus) on time without worrying about being late.

Could use more W Line
It's unclear to me how this will affect me as your online presentation gave zero details on what the proposed
changes will look like in praxis. All the presentation says is that there are proposed changes to help with tardy
trains and to better match bus schedules. I cannot find any information on what this actually looks like and what
exactly the proposed changes are. This makes it pretty difficult for any riders to provide actionable feedback.
Please do better.
More security on this rail line would be helpful
What i really want is just transparency. What about a text line so I can find out what time the next train will be. But
actually accurate. Not just a pdf of the poster at stations. Like real time information.
I have tried to find information on what this change is. In any case, the current schedule has W line departing
Union Station only 2 minutes after A line arrives. I currently am a federal employee and with the return to work
order, I am trying to take A line from Aurora to the Federal Center. If you can have W line depart 5 to 7 minutes
after A line arrives at Union Station that would work well. Currently, I have to wait 15 minutes for W line to depart,
wasting 30 minutes of my day. Thank you!
What are the minor changes to schedule? I can't provide feedback unless I have actual information.
Train needs to run later after events! Was leaving ball arena once with one train left for the night, the train came
by saying out of service leaving hundreds stranded. Had to pay $80 for an uber home, and now makes us
nervous to use RTD for late night events as we can park for $30

Please plan accordingly so we do not have construction sites scattered without a promising competition date.

Depends on what the changes are but if the changes mean the train will show up at the time wits supposed to
and makes it to where it's supposed to on time and is a line that makes sense for workers that work downtown
commuting from Littleton then yes that seems positive (again nothing is provided on what the actual change is) need officers on this line with all of the unhoused on fentanyl unclothed on the train
It seems like the schedule is changed every few months it's starting to be unwieldy

performance on weekends as well.

Having more frequent busses coming by would be really convenient and helpful. Its happened multiple times in
the freezing cold weather, where a group of us will be waiting for the 16 but this is after 7 pm and the google
maps will say that one is coming in less than 10 minutes but then that time passes, and I would check again, and
it'll say that a bus is coming by in 20 or so minutes. I understand that the times online can't always be accurate
but to go from thinking you're gonna wait 10 minutes, to waiting 30 to 40 minutes in freezing cold temperature. A
lot of these people waiting already have health problems, and maybe i know that i get to go home to a warm
place, i know that not everybody does.
This is a well traveled route that offers important connection to the W line and will improve my commute options

I love the increase in service along a vital corridor. Living on colfax & osage, this connects me to west colfax and
to civic center, woth almost no other transit options. We need more 10 minute headway across RTD.
Increased frequency makes it easier for me to choose the 16 over the W.
this will alleviate the packed buses I encounter daily, standing room only occasionally, this is a commuter route for
me, odd hours throughout the day, this makes my commute much more reliable
I take the 16 everyday from work. Increasing this frequency of stops would give me more flexibility and reduce
crowding.
Bring back the West Colfax limited, service for West Denver has only gotten worse over time and never improved
This is a change that should be implemented BEFORE September… but if we HAVE to wait, then I suppose we
have to. Make a connection to the W line more often as well from this bus line at ONE or TWO stations.
Having 10 Minute afternoon frequencies are very important and I am glad it's happening, will it use more block
than currently used? Considering the fact that 1609 joins mid-day it in theory shouldn't consume blocks.

This is an excellent change for the 73 and the improved frequency makes the route much more useful.
About every other week, I have an appointment in Lowry. Increased frequency on Route 73 will mean my
transfers are shorter, as well as shorter wait time on the return trip.
I take this route to work in the morning and am often only just able to catch it as a transfer from the A line, and
with the way my schedule is, I just miss the bus to get home, resulting in me waiting at my stop for at least 30
minutes, and this increase would be convenient for myself and others.

Reduced headways are very nice during the day. With the last service change (Jan 2025), evening connections
between A line westbound and Route 73 southbound were significantly degraded. The 30 minute headway on A
line and 30 minute headway on Route 73 were desync'd, which resulted in excessively long connection times
(20+ minutes, rather than 5 minutes). If the departure times were resync'd, it would be very much appreciated.
Sundays between 8pm - 11pm should be at 30 minute intervals at the very least. I work at the Central Park
Walmart and having to stay and wait an hour for the bus is a huge inconvenience to myself and other coworkers
who rely on public transportation. When we get off work, we want to go home. Not be forced to sit and wait for an
extra hour. The 73 is already inconsistent enough and it’s NEVER on time.

It is important that the service align with the A Line at Central Park Station.v
My daughter takes this bus to and from school and it is always packed. Running additional buses during that time
also means that she doesn’t have to get to school 25 minutes early because the later bus gets there too late.
I take the 73 quite often during the week to get to and from school, so this is very helpful
I like this change a lot and think it will help me more

Increasing frequency during business hours will make the commute better aligned with the transfers I need to
make.
This would be optimal as between 4-6 pm the bus is generally either too early, running late (10 or more minutes),
and lots of students leaving little to no seating. It’s hard when you are transferring from a 83L or83D and the
buses are literally missing one another depending on who gets to location 16178 first.
I do like the idea of running more buses on Quebec St, but I also think the fifteen minute interval needs to be on
Saturday as well as there are a lot of essential business services along Quebec that people want to get to,
especially as this bus connects with a good number of other routes. You also need a bus route that serves
Quebec south of Belleview Station, call it route 74 and have it run along South Quebec between Belleview and C470 University Park and Ride, connecting with Highlands Ranch and routes 24 and 402L, and also 66 at
Arapahoe Road.

My daughter takes this bus to and from school. Moving to 15 minute increments will make it much easier for her
to get to and from school on time, and to coordinate with various after school activities. I would hope the 15

Pleased to be getting back to a better (i.e. more frequent buses) schedule.

We would like to see bus to High School and back. In fact during summer we see them going there, they just don’t

My husband works in Boulder but we live in the mountains, with his work schedule he was not able to commute

Hello,

I just want to make sure that #44 Bus has more busses going to and from downtown to Ward Road and not just
every hour. There have been some busses quite recently that have gotten taken out of rotation so I had to figure it
out and take the W Line (grateful for that its there) and then catch the 100 bus down Kipling street. Can we make
sure that there are more busses added to and from? I think that is what it looks like here that is being proposed
but just want to make sure during the summer hours that I don't get stuck waiting. Overall this bus line is amazing
and love my bus drivers :-)
This bus helps connect me to more parts of the city and having it run more often during peak times will be helpful
It would be even better if there were more buses per hour on this route.

The hourly run of the 44, is the biggest challenge. Half hour stops would be a huge improvement to this line.
Timing for arrival/departure times on inbound/outbound busses for getting to/from downtown is inconvenient for a
9-5 arrival/departure. The 48 runs more often but takes longer to get downtown. It would be nice if the 44, had this
option.
Commuter time services are necessary for access to downtown.
Any increase on rt 44 would be positive.
This change is not enough. The 44 needs to run more often than once per hour all day long.

I take this bus in the 8 o clock hour as does my child. Adding another bus would be very beneficial to the
neighborhood and hopefully increase ridership.
I don't often take the 44 but I am glad it is still available to me west of Kipling.
I frequently use this route it would be convenient to have more buses run.
Would love earlier options before 5pm to aid parents going home to pick up kids from daycare/school.
Losing the half hour rush hour buses in January had a large impact on my ability to get two and from work on
time. I know a number of people that had to stop taking the bus altogether. Adding these 4 times back into the
schedule is extremely helpful and I look forward to this getting passed.
The recent changes to the January 2025 Scheduling have had very negative impact on commuting options into
and out of the downtown. The inclusion of more frequent morning and evening schedules will greatly help support
ridership and address many of the issues facing right now due to timing, capacity and lack of accomodation.
Thank you.
This is a good start, but improving frequency to 30 minutes all day long on weekdays is essential for us to
consider using the 44 again as much as we were before the last service reduction.
I would like to see RTD bring back the weekday 6am eastbound trip from Wheat Ridge/Ward so that employees
reporting downtown can arrive by 7am! Overall, very excited about this service change, the 44 certainly needs
more frequent peak hour service than the current 60 minute service.

Thank you for adding some of the peak-travel period trips back!! It's been hard for me to use the 44 since the
January service changes reduced the trips at peak commute times. Having these additional times will really make
the 44 more useful for me.
It would also still be great to add back a 6am departure from Ward Station in future.
Thank you for bringing them back, although taking them away will have caused a huge hit on 44 ridership which
may be unrecoverable at this stage.

the 38 is CONSISTENTLY more than 10 minutes late. not only does it require infrastructure updates such as bus
lanes along 38th ave bridge, bur it it also requires increased frequency because populated west denver is
severely disconnected from the rest of the city and cross town commutes are excessively long. it should be

There needs to be an increase to half hourly frequency on the route. This route is unique in being in the city of
Denver on a core arterial and running only hourly
I rely on this bus to get from my apartment to the university light rail station. This line already has very poor
frequency. Reducing this further would be even worse
This route would be useful for people living in cap hill if the frequency wasn’t abysmal, especially on weekends.
People will not ride a bus that shows up once an hour. It’s way too much planning for transit in a large city like
Denver. More frequency during the day please

Used to take #24 to work but then schedule changed to once an hour and ending early evening. Now I hardly ride
the bus. Can't go to concerts at DU when the bus doesn't run after 9pm. Can't take the bus to the airport train
when weekend service starts after 8am and ends too early to transfer from the train station at 40th & Colorado.
Very sad.
Would use it more if there were higher frequencies
I use the 24 more often in the Summer to get to Highlands Ranch, so this is very beneficial to me

I have told you once and I will tell you again, route 24 needs to be on a half hour interval, at least between 40th
and Colorado Station and Hampden Ave, and especially now that the 35 bus is going east again. And what you
can do is have one 24 follow it's existing route between 40th and C-470, while the other one goes between 40th
and Englewood Station to connect with the southwest light rail line, enabling people in Englewood and Littleton to
have another option to go to places like Cherry Creek Mall and the Botanic Gardens, as well as better connecting
people who live along University Blvd to places like Swedish Medical Center without having to change buses, it
would make a lot of sense.

Could Willoughby corner be referred to as affordable? Otherwise great and necessary accommodation!
My child attends Peak to Peak next door to Willoughby and this would be a great way to catch the bus instead of
walking over a mile to the Lafayette Park n Ride to catch the DASH. We used to have a stop right in front of the
school, but that was taken away. This new stop would be great!

Yes please add more connections for the tenants and willoughbouy corner
The main issue with the DASH is that it spends 10 minutes driving through Main Street Louisville, Pine Street and
Via Appia before getting back on South Boulder Road. There are not enough people who get on the bus at that
stop to warrant the big U through Louisville every 1/2 hour. What needs to be done is having it where every hour,
there are 2 dash buses that leave at 30 minute intervals, with one of the buses going from the Willoughby center
and follow South Boulder from South Public in Lafayette to Broadway in Boulder. The other bus should leave from
the Lafayette park and ride and do the current route.

Would love to use the 12 to take the A line but it just comes a little late. Excited to see this improved. Consistent
schedule and frequency too! Thanks.

Please make the chances at the schedule, to make it more frequently, also if you can do it in at the general
system this change you gonna prioritize the walkers. And please make as much as posible that the routes whit
intersections match, cause some times we have to wait 15 or more minutes to take the other bus at the stop, that
make all the system slow and unfunctional for example the intersection with between 12 route and 83 at speer blv
Is almost impossible to take it on time if the route 12 come just 3 or 4 minutes late. Please check these kind of
details to make a useful public service of transportation, and be the city who we are
Make the frequency even higher during peak travel times!!!!!! Every 5 minutes!!!!!
Great!! I sometimes use this transfer to get from my home in Capitol Hill to DIA, but so often the A train pulls up to
the station right as the 12 is leaving. I end up calling an uber instead of waiting another half hour for the 12 to
come back around, which is really a shame because by that point I’ve paid the $10 RTD pass and should be
getting more mileage out of it. What’s the point of having all those stops on the A line if the transfers don’t work?
Glad to see yall are working on this.

Fix the LD1. Your last schedule change leaving Longmont 6 minutes late makes me consistently late to work.
Even worse, the 5:30 bus has made me miss my connecting bus in Longmont, leaving me to walk home every
night. Most days, the 5:30 bus leaves Union Station at least 3-5 minutes late, meaning we get to Longmont 10
minutes late. Since we lost the LX buses, my commute is now 2 hours one way.

All night service, even if just hourly, would help with my commute to work greatly.

The BOLT is a great option to access employment and services in Boulder from Longmont as well as connecting
to other regional routes into Denver. However, on Saturday and Sundays you don't run the full route, starting and
stopping at Bross/8th. The 324, which would connect to that stop, does not begin running until after 8am on the
weekends and stops running before the BOLT ends. I live in NE Longmont off 21st. I already have to walk a mile
to the bus stop to access either line at 21/Main. Not running the BOLT the full route on weekends limits my access
to a needed transportation option.
Please bring back the early BOLT route. I have to be in Longmont by 0645, and have not been able to take bus.

Depends on the minor changes…but I like the stops that are available, but I really would appreciate more bus
frequency on the weekends. Like maybe every 30 minutes instead of every hour on the weekends

I love this change and thinks its great that its connecting the new low income housing area. However I believe
there is increased demand within Boulder City limits for service along the Baseline corridor. I think it would be
beneficial to run 225L (local) buses that run from Downtown Boulder Station to somewhere around Platt Middle
School that when combined with the existing 225 services would provide 15 headways along Baseline. This would
provide more value per mile as this is a shorter route with more density. Thanks!

Most major cold weather cities provide some sort of place to stay warm during the winter months while waiting for
buses and trains.
I find it difficult to accept that Denver RTD apparently has no interest in providing a warm enclosure at major
transit hubs, specifically the Central Park Station.
Wait times between buses are usually 30 minutes, sometimes longer. I won’t use RTD during the cold months if I
have to stand in the cold/wind. Thank you.

You don’t even tell me what the changes this is the most ridiculous way to communicate a change
I dont know what tripper service is, i dont know if the changes to schedule make the bus run more or less

The bus should come more frequently on this line as its route goes right by a high school, a senior center, City
Park, and downtown. It seems to come twice an hour at best, assuming it's not running late or leaving significantly
early.
Impact would depend on how significantly the schedule changes affect my commute. Improving on-time
performance would be helpful, as this bus is typically very late during the morning commute. The trip planner app
is often unreliable I. This scenario, as the bus just gets later as it gets closer.
This bus is ALWAYS delayed at least 10-15 minutes in the afternoon and results in me missing my connection!
Please increase frequency or adjust the schedule accordingly.

i would love if this route was on time, it’s hard to catch sometimes if it’s late and sometimes it’s packed with east
high school students
More buses during commute hours (7am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm)
Decreases frequency - want better all day frequency as an alternative to route 15 during construction
It would be great if the 20 ran more frequently!

The 20 route west of downtown only runs 3 times in the morning (6:00, 7:00, and 8:00 roughly) and 3 times in the
afternoon (3:12, 4:12, and 5:33 from NREL). Many nrel employees (myself included) would benefit from increased
frequency (even to 30 minutes) and possibly a shifted schedule to have a later bus in the morning and at night
I ride the 20 to and from work, and it is often running late, so more on-time busses would be great.
Please run more frequently
The 20 west remains absolutely useless , with only 6 stops a day. With this and removal of The West Colfax
limited bus service for West Denver has only gotten worse over time not better.

I do not know what kind of adjustments to the schedule will be made to Route 483, but it should align with the
schedule with the the rail lines’ northbound departure and their southbound arrival, with a few minutes offset to

transferring.

Last summer the Jump stopped at 48th and Arapahoe at 3:30pm and then not until 4:40pm. There needs to be a

Hopefully this makes it easier to catch FF1 in downtown, some times the connections are too tight when Jump is
just slightly delayed.

connections such as Fox St making them almost utterly unnecessary and wasteful)

Thank you for doing this, Pecos Junction is too difficult to access on foot from a bus stop because of having to
cross a street and walk along a road that has no sidewalks. Best thing about this is I don't have to board the 19 on
Wewatta and 17th anymore and can take the B or G line part of the way and get on the 19 at the station without
having to walk to Pecos, looking forward to this change since there is one store I always have to use this route to
get to.

I can't figure out what these changes are because all it says is timing. However I use this bus a lot and wish it ran
more than once an hour.
Doesn't run frequently enough
The connection from South Bound Route 51 to East Bound Route 9 would be better if Route 9 arrived at 10th and
Sheridan 3 minutes after the 51 has passed.
Stop 11926 at 9th and Vrain seems to be placed on Alert whenever a small amount of snow has fallen, the detour
requires Ederly people to push a Walker up a steep hill.

I would like to see increased frequency on this line or a separate line to cover tower road and the Reunion

I seek leadership to discontinue 169L route to DIA and expand service to Arapahoe at Village Center Station on
Weekends by rerouting route 169L to 40th & Airport Station and increasing service on weekdays and weekends.
Lastly I would like to seek leadership to add weekend route 169 route to Arapahoe at Village Center Station to
increase connectivity for routes 169 and 169L while route 169L keeping the East Metro 9300 series fleet and
change route 169 6000 and 6300 series fleet on weekends from Transdev Commerce City to RTD East Metro

I ride this bus on a daily basis and I am on the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee. I have heard from many fellow
riders of the P, and I have seen it myself, that ridership has significantly grown in the last year or so, to the point
where buses are full. It would be nice to add another bus each direction please. Sometime around 6:30AM to
Denver and 4:00PM to Parker

The frequency is still too low, and light rail is not a reliable alternative if I have to work late
That isn't a great change, it would work out better as PV or PS.
I seek leadership in permanently discontinuing route P service due to low ridership and underutilization. Please

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Paratransit Program Modifications

March 12, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On February 27, 2024, the General Manager and CEO commissioned a peer review of RTD’s paratransit
service delivery, to be conducted by subject-matter experts selected by the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA). APTA convened the peer review panel, which included a
geographical representation of panelists from across the country. During the months-long review, the
panelists leveraged their expertise and professional experience to assess both RTD’s Access-a-Ride
(AaR) service, the agency’s complementary American with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit service, and
RTD’s Access-on-Demand (AoD) premium supplemental paratransit service.
The overarching goal of the peer review was to help the agency better understand strengths and
opportunities, with respect to both ADA complementary paratransit and premium supplemental ondemand service, and to note potential improvements that support long-term sustainability. The panel
conducted a review of RTD’s paratransit operations to identify (1) best practices employed by similar
transit agencies, including for demand-response programs; (2) model program parameters, including
responsible cost controls and sound customer-facing processes; and (3) software, hardware, or other
tools to ensure optimal service performance and program cost-effectiveness.
The on-site portion of the review was conducted between May 20 and 24, 2024. In advance of the onsite visit, RTD provided the panelists with documentation for their edification. While on-site at RTD
facilities, the panelists assessed RTD’s paratransit operations through further documentation review,
field observations, and a series of briefings and interviews with agency staff, contractors, paratransit
customers, and community stakeholders. The final report formalized the panelists’ observations and
recommendations.
DISCUSSION
Staff will provide the Board of Directors a summary of policy recommendations under consideration for
changes to AaR and AoD services. These recommended program modifications were developed as a
result of recommendations from the APTA peer review, public feedback collected over multiple phases

Packet Pg. 245

1.F.1

of customer and stakeholder outreach, and additional sources of information such as data analysis,
industry research, and a survey of other transit agencies.
The peer review report outlined several observations and recommendations for RTD’s consideration,
which the agency assessed to determine their viability within its operating environment. All policy
changes related to RTD’s paratransit service delivery were brought to the Board for its consideration.
The peer review panelists recommended three overarching initiatives to strengthen RTD’s paratransit
service:
• Develop a clearly stated vision for paratransit as a whole to guide priorities in the AaR and AoD
services
• Refresh the AoD program structure to create a financially sustainable option that serves customer
needs
• Leverage technology and process improvements to streamline daily work to improve staff
efficiency, reallocate staff to more impactful work, deliver better service, and reduce costs
Additionally, the panel recommended multiple actions to enhance RTD’s paratransit services. These
recommendations are included in the full report.
Subsequent to receipt of the APTA peer review report, RTD staff undertook the following steps in
August, September, and October 2024:
• Communications/outreach strategy, Phase I
• Initial recommendations review
• Initial Board presentation
• Data and trend analysis
• Initial feedback solicited from customers and stakeholders
• Quantitative/qualitative customer feedback analysis
• Evaluation of other agencies’ paratransit and on-demand programs
• In-depth case studies development
• Phase I proposed recommendations development
Phase I proposed recommendations were presented to the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee
and to the Board of Directors in November and December 2024. Subsequently, RTD staff undertook
additional public outreach. Based upon customer feedback and staff analysis, staff is recommending the
following proposed modifications to paratransit programs:
Access on Demand
• $4.50 base fare/$2.25 for LiVE eligible customers
• $20/trip subsidy
• 40 trips/month cap
• Service area and hours align with AaR
• Customers must be enrolled/established in AaR before AoD
• Modified suspension policy

Packet Pg. 246

1.F.1

•

Incent Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) to provide Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles
(WAVs)

Access-A-Ride
• Require recertifications every five years (currently every four years)
• Modify on-time performance metric to measure pickup and drop off
• Explore software modifications to support changes in service provision and productivity
enhancements
• Modify conditional eligibility process
• Implement contract modifications/enhanced contract management
• Modify suspension policy
• Develop fleet procurement plan with modified fleet mix
Customer comments submitted through the communications and outreach process are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact of the preliminary program modifications contemplated is a
reduction of roughly $380,000, or 36 percent, in current monthly AoD program costs of $1.1 million.

Peer Review Recommended Actions Summary
1. Empower staff and contractors to set boundaries
on the AoD service in alignment with service mission

5. Identify an “empowered owner” of paratransit who
can get into details and lead on policy

2. Create a technology and data strategy

6. Implement software that can automate tasks,
including trip caps across all AoD providers and
reduce manual oversight of the program

3. Reduce compliance exposure by evaluating
service area “donut holes,” reevaluate enabling
legacy customers outside the ¾-mile fixed-route
service area, and review the fare policy to the airport
4. Evaluate AaR reporting standards for on-time
performance, conduct regular checks on data and
other parameters used for key performance
indicators

March 12, 2025

7. Review contractor management processes and
requirements to improve service and streamline
operations

17:30:34 Good evening, everybody. We're going to give it just a moment or two for everyone to get settled and
then we will get started.
17:31:24 Excellent. So in the interest of time, let's go ahead and get started.
17:31:28 I want to make sure everyone is able to
17:31:32 Enjoy the presentation. You can have a good…
17:31:36 good public meeting. So my name is Brandon Figliolino. I manage the community engagement
programming here for the Regional Transportation District.
17:31:44 And I'm joined by my colleague and teammate, Fred Worthen. He is the Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations.
17:31:51 Fred is going to give you a brief overview of the recommendations
17:31:56 that RTD is proposing for the Access-on-Demand and Access-a-Ride programs.
17:32:01 And then I will facilitate a public comment period after.
17:32:08 Thanks, Brandon. Good evening, everyone. I'm Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations.
17:32:14 I do apologize, but we do have a hard stop tonight at 630.
17:32:19 It is my wife's birthday and my son is in from college. So I apologize, but we will make this as judicious as
possible.
17:32:29 Tonight, I will go over some of the program
17:32:33 the program and challenges associated with our Access-a-Ride and Access-on-Demand
17:32:40 systems and services.
17:32:42 Stemming from the APTA peer review. And I will go over proposed changes.
17:32:48 The feedback and input process. And then Brandon will talk about next steps.
17:32:53 Next slide, please.
17:32:58 All right. So RTD's paratransit program is comprised of our Access-a-Ride service and our supplemental
17:33:05 premium paratransit service, commonly referred to as access on demand.
17:33:10 Our Access-a-Ride services are complementary paratransit services
17:33:14 that are conditionally provided to passengers who live within and or travel within three quarters of a mile
17:33:19 of RTD's fixed route services or rail stations due to a disability or mobility to barrier as defined within the
criteria set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
17:33:31 These services supplement regular fixed route services.

Public Meeting
Paratransit Peer Review, December 2024 Update
December 11, 2024, 5:30pm

17:33:35 Customers are required to pay a fare associated with the trip taken. All Access-a-Ride vehicles are
branded and are 100% accessible.

Packet Pg. 303

1.F.1.b

17:33:42 RTD's Access-on-Demand program is a supplemental premium service that provides curb-to-curb taxi and
rideshare options.

17:33:56 that is available to current eligible access ride customers.
17:34:00 Access-on-Demand customers do not pay an initial upfront fare like they do on regular accessory ride.
17:34:06 RTD pays the first $25 of the customer's trip.
17:34:09 Any cost above $25 is paid by the customer and customers can take up to 60 total trips per month
17:34:16 on any one of four different service providers.
17:34:20 Next slide.
17:34:24 So Access-on-Demand is meant to be a supplemental service. It is not a replacement for Access-a-Ride.
17:34:32 RTD has seen a growth within the Access-on-Demand program
17:34:37 that is operationally and fiscally not sustainable. Cost for the program has grown from the pilot inception
of $85,000 a month
17:34:47 to nearly $1.2 million a month since the program's inception. This is an unsustainable growth due to
unintended
17:34:56 induced demand for our services.
17:34:59 Next slide.
17:35:02 As previously mentioned, Access-on-Demand is meant to be supplemental, not a replacement for Accessa-Ride.
17:35:07 examples of
17:35:09 of the Access-on-Demand
17:35:11 service would include using the service for medical appointments, such as scheduling paratransit for
regular recurring appointments
17:35:19 While keeping on-demand services as backup for last-minute changes.
17:35:24 Other examples include unforeseen circumstances or situations.
17:35:29 Again, our paratransit services are meant to be the primary routine travel, including to work and school.
However.
17:35:37 we do recognize that things happen. So having an on-demand backup for a last minute situation is, again,
an example of Access-on-Demand services.
17:35:48 And another good example is shopping. It is very difficult to schedule regular shopping trips. You never
know how long it is going to take in a grocery store.
17:35:58 So having a Access-on-Demand trip available for unplanned shopping needs is an example of the intended
use

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:33:50 Access-on-Demand services are currently available 24 seven throughout the entire RTD service area.

17:36:07 of the Access-on-Demand services.
17:36:11 So I have previously spoken about the app to peer review in past public meetings, so we won't go over
those again.

Packet Pg. 304

1.F.1.b

17:36:19 But what I will say is that a significant amount of information has been gathered and utilized to formulate
paratransit program modifications under consideration.

17:36:40 Information collected from 21 different transit agencies
17:36:44 two different customer surveys, which we received 300 responses from a public survey
17:36:49 And 428 responses from statistical sampling of customers.
17:36:55 We received 561 comments through the online feedback form.
17:37:00 And we also hosted three public meetings, one in person and two virtual.
17:37:05 Next slide.
17:37:09 After considering customer feedback and a regression analysis conducted on the customer survey,
customer program usage data, and other factors
17:37:18 Staff has developed a number of recommendations for consideration with regard to the Access-onDemand program.
17:37:23 I'll go over the key recommendations and the considerations shown on the screen. Then I'll provide other
relevant data to help how we develop these recommendations.
17:37:34 First, we're recommending that customers pay a base fare equivalent to fare paid on Access-a-Ride
services.
17:37:40 This includes a $4.50 base fare for customers or a reduced fare of $2.25
17:37:46 for live customers.
17:37:48 Staff is also recommending reducing the cap to 30 trips per month.
17:37:52 And recommending that the subsidy per ride be increased to $30.
17:37:57 These recommendations are in alignment with the responses from customers regarding the order of
importance
17:38:03 For program elements with the reasonable fare being the most important element. We're also
recommending that the service area and service hours be modified to mirror those of the Access-a-Ride program in
effect at the time.
17:38:14 This does mean that service hours and area will change in alignment with fixed route service changes.
17:38:20 Staff is also recommending a prerequisite that customers must be enrolled in and use Access-a-Ride
services
17:38:26 for 90 days in alignment with average customer usage of access rights services.
17:38:31 before becoming eligible for Access-on-Demand services.
17:38:35 Staff is also considering modifications to the suspension policy
17:38:40 as well as ways to incentivize TNCs or transit network providers

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:36:30 as a result of the active peer review that was conducted. This includes industry research such as transit
cooperative research program data

17:38:45 to provide more wheelchair accessible vehicles. TNCs are Lyft, Uber, Metro Taxi, and Z Trip.
17:38:55 Next slide.

Packet Pg. 305

1.F.1.b

17:38:58 Utilizing survey information and customer feedback, staff is also looking at a number of programmatic
changes or enhancements

17:39:06 This includes changing recertifications from four years to five.
17:39:10 On-time performance will also be modified to measure pickup and drop off metrics.
17:39:15 We're also exploring software modifications to support changes in service provision and to provide
productivity enhancements.
17:39:23 There will also be modifications to conditional eligibility process.
17:39:27 we are exploring contract modifications as well as modifications to the existing suspension policy.
17:39:34 And finally, we're working on developing a fleet procurement plan to procure smaller vehicles
17:39:39 such as sedans and minivans.
17:39:44 Next steps. Brandon, were you going to take this from here?
17:39:50 Yes, I can briefly go over the next steps.
17:39:55 So in November of 2024, we shared all of the feedback we previously received with the board of
directors.
17:40:03 And provided these initial recommendations and proposed
17:40:06 modifications to Access-a-Ride and access on demand.
17:40:11 In December and January, we are hosting these public meetings for individuals to provide public comment
on the changes.
17:40:18 And we also launched an online feedback tool
17:40:21 at our paratransit website
17:40:25 at rtd-denver.com.
17:40:28 In January of 2025, we'll send another update out to stakeholders and paratransit
17:40:36 And we will close the feedback tool. And then through February and up to May 2025,
17:40:43 We'll share all of the additional feedback we've received with the board of directors.
17:40:47 and take policy related recommendations to the board for consideration.
17:40:53 Staff will work to adopt the recommendations that are approved by the board
17:40:58 directors and any changes
17:41:00 will be made as part of the May 2025 service changes, which happen
17:41:06 throughout the district with our bus and rail.
17:41:11 operations.
17:41:14 So now we've come to the public comment period of our evening. This is the opportunity

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:39:04 for the Access-a-Ride program.

17:41:21 for you to provide comment on
17:41:24 the proposed recommendations.

Packet Pg. 306

1.F.1.b

17:41:26 So customers wishing to provide public comment orally should raise their virtual hand and will be called
on once at a time.

17:41:38 the little raise hand that is located on the bottom of your screen.
17:41:45 under the React.
17:41:47 Rather, you go to react and then
17:41:50 raise hand gestures.
17:41:52 I'll call on you one at a time and you'll have two minutes to provide your public comment.
17:41:57 After two minutes have expired, please wrap up your comments so we can move on to the next
commenter.
17:42:04 Customers who do not wish to speak but wish to provide their comments can also use our question and
answer session.
17:42:12 box, which is located also below
17:42:16 in um
17:42:18 navigation bar.
17:42:20 Tonight, it's important to recognize that RTD staff are not going to respond to comments or answer
questions. This is merely the opportunity for you
17:42:29 So provide your feedback.
17:42:31 allow us the opportunity to write down and document those comments for inclusion in the board report.
17:42:41 Just as a reminder, we're all people here and we want to be treated with respect. So please make sure
that your comments are
17:42:50 professional and kind to ensure there is adequate time for public comment. I see there are eight people
that want to speak already.
17:42:58 Please make sure that you are being
17:43:02 quick and using brevity in your comments. Once the two minutes are up, please finish your comment so
we can move on and provide opportunity for others to speak.
17:43:13 As Fred mentioned, one hour is scheduled and we will end at 630 on the dot. And if you haven't been
called or been able to provide comment at that point.
17:43:22 There will be other meetings available.
17:43:25 And our website tool as well.
17:43:30 All right, so I am going to go ahead and request the first individual to
17:43:37 speak.
17:43:39 Just give me one second, Beth.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:41:34 To do that, you just need to select the

17:43:41 And if you can, before you speak, just say your name for the record.
17:43:49 And I will get the…

Packet Pg. 307

1.F.1.b

17:43:52 little timer up and then you will be uh
17:43:56 able to speak.

17:43:58 Hi, Beth. Are you able to hear me?
17:44:00 I can hear you perfect. Can you hear me?
17:44:04 Okay.
17:44:02 Excellent. Please go ahead and share your comments.
17:44:06 Now, I do want to just
17:44:08 ask before I actually start this can you
17:44:10 briefly summarize what the proposed
17:44:13 Recommendations. Thanks for pausing.
17:44:14 Yeah, absolutely.
17:44:16 are just brief summary real quick.
17:44:19 Thank you.
17:44:18 Yeah, so the changes are what Fred just mentioned. So we would implement a $4.50 base fare for
17:44:28 Mm-hmm.
17:44:31 Hmm.
17:44:29 access on demand, we would cap the trips at 30 trips per month.
17:44:34 we would increase the subsidy per ride to $30.
17:44:39 we would mirror the ADA service area and service hours for access on demand.
17:44:46 And we would…
17:44:49 work with the transportation network companies to try to incorporate more vehicles that have wheelchair
accessibility.
17:44:57 Okay, I'll begin my comment right now.
17:45:01 Excellent.
17:45:02 I do not exactly agree with any $4.50 base fare.
17:45:09 As it sits here.
17:45:11 we already have a cap at 60 trips and it's not really working out.
17:45:15 I'm also concerned
17:45:17 The suspension policy has left.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:43:58 Okay.

17:45:20 I'm a blind mother. I am also a blind single mother. I'm co-parenting with
17:45:27 Oh, technically we're not married. Co-parenting with another blind person. It's very challenging for us to
get around.

Packet Pg. 308

1.F.1.b

17:45:34 The $4.50 base fare would mean we'd have to have more money in our wallets.
17:45:40 For transportation, if we're going to do anything at all.

17:45:47 Also, my partner has asked me to provide that due to the suspensions.
17:45:52 I think we need to do away with all that because it's cost him
17:45:56 to have to spend a $20 on tip
17:45:58 Due to Colorado inclement weather and groceries.
17:46:03 We're tipping $20
17:46:06 just for groceries.
17:46:08 And that is not okay because of you're not letting him
17:46:12 there's not a lot of family and friends support for either of us.
17:46:17 And I don't think capping trips at 30, we don't need limits i understand
17:46:21 What we're trying to do with what we're trying to do
17:46:25 I'm trying to do with subsidies. But if you cannot do something to keep us safe as a family.
17:46:30 we might end up with like, for example, my partner Clay almost got shot on a public bus
17:46:37 Albeit out of state.
17:46:39 we as blind people will never be able to simply get cars, jump in and go places. I almost got weary of a
guy in a Bronco jacket.
17:46:47 merely yelling at a driver and he kind of was off so
17:46:55 Awesome, Beth. Well, thank you so much for the comment tonight. We have that documented.
17:47:05 All right. Next up, we have Evan Silverman.
17:47:09 If you give me just a moment, I will reset the timer for you.
17:47:17 All right, Evan, can you hear me?
17:47:18 Yeah, can you hear me?
17:47:20 Yeah, go ahead. Thank you.
17:47:21 Thank you. Thank you very much for this opportunity to give my perspective about the proposed changes
to RTDs.
17:47:27 Access-on-Demand Program. My name is Evan Silverman and I've been diagnosed with a mental illness
17:47:32 Which makes it so I can't drive a car
17:47:35 I also have a degenerative condition called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
17:47:38 Which means I may need more support and assistance as I get older.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:45:43 We are not on a large income.

17:47:41 I've been a participant in the Access-on-Demand program since July 1st, 2023, and it has been very
liberating.

Packet Pg. 309

1.F.1.b

17:47:48 There's allowed me to easily make it to doctor's appointments, the grocery store, and other vital
destinations.

17:47:58 Knowing I could count on Rise was very, very helpful.
17:48:02 By far the main concern I have relates to reducing the number of rights to 30 each month.
17:48:06 I do the number would stay at 60, but if changes have to be made, I hope that like in Boston, there could
be at least 40.
17:48:13 I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 is reasonable.
17:48:17 I have thought of one way the number of rides can be kept from being reduced to 30.
17:48:21 The idea is to raise the base customer affair once people exceed 30 rents for the month.
17:48:25 In other words, rides 31 to 45 would be charged, say, $8.
17:48:30 I truly think the Access-on-Demand service has been amazing and I know I am not alone in that view.
17:48:34 For over 15 years, I've been very active in the Denver community and I would be willing to volunteer my
time
17:48:39 to participate in some sort of focus group to come up with new ideas
17:48:43 that other services administered.
17:48:45 I want to thank RTD for supporting this program for four years.
17:48:48 Healthy RTD staff realizes how important this service has been for so many people and be mindful of this
when making any changes. Thank you.
17:48:56 Thank you so much, Evan. We appreciate your comments tonight.
17:49:01 Thanks, Seven.
17:49:03 All right. Next up, I have Gabriel gates
17:49:22 Gabriel, are you able to unmute?
17:49:28 There, I think I got it now. Can you hear me?
17:49:30 Yeah. Hi, Gabriel. Please share your comment.
17:49:31 Okay. Thank you. My name is Gabe Gates, and I appreciate the updates and the recommendations that
you've provided in your presentation.
17:49:41 Today, while
17:49:44 Many of us are not going to be satisfied with the recommendations.
17:49:48 One of the things that I don't agree with is the guidelines
17:49:53 that pertain to having to result back to using access a ride.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:47:53 This past summer, I was homeless and living in a hotel for two and a half months and not in good shape
mentally.

17:50:03 Unless that
17:50:07 option is improved.
17:50:09 and becomes more effective and efficient.

Packet Pg. 310

1.F.1.b

17:50:12 I don't have a youth

17:50:30 specifically to work. I also want to ask
17:50:35 the RTD to look into the link
17:50:39 rideshare program in Lone Tree to help bolster
17:50:44 the access a ride program.
17:50:48 I know that i know that
17:50:50 I used AccessAride before Access On Demand, and I only used it because there was no other option. If I
went back to that option
17:51:00 it would cause a lot of inconvenience and inefficiencies
17:51:04 with my home life and my work life. I also ask for an increased transparency about why these
recommendations are coming out.
17:51:12 I understand there's regression analyses.
17:51:15 that have been performed. So I just like a little bit more information about why these recommendations
are being pointed.
17:51:21 And not just because it's something that you guys been leaning toward
17:51:26 because of the unsustainable
17:51:30 an instability of the financial and fiscal responsibility
17:51:35 to the recent
17:51:37 access on-demand ride share program. Thank you.
17:51:41 Thank you, Kate.
17:51:43 Thank you, Gabriel. We appreciate your comments tonight.
17:51:46 Next up, we have Kathy Reid.
17:52:03 There you go.
17:52:03 Hi, Kathy. Can you hear me?
17:52:13 Kathy, you're unmuted. Can you hear us?
17:52:24 Kathy, are you able to speak?
17:52:27 I want to make sure that we can hear you.
17:52:38 it appears as we may be having technical difficulty let's uh
17:52:42 go to the next
17:52:44 person and leave Kathy in the queue.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:50:15 for that option. Access on demand, like Evan has said, has been incredible. It's been amazing ever since
you brought that on board. It provides me with an effective and efficient route to the places I need to get to.

17:52:47 Yeah, Kathy, we will come back to you.

17:53:02 Oh, can you guys hear me now?
17:53:05 Yes.

17:53:06 Oh my gosh.
17:53:07 Share your comments.
17:53:08 Now I can't hear you.
17:53:11 Sorry, I don't, I'm usually better at this, but…
17:53:15 Okay, so my comments were…
17:53:19 Oh my gosh, I apologize, friends.
17:53:23 There you go. We can see you now.
17:53:24 All right, there we go. Okay, so I had a couple of thoughts. One of them was um
17:53:31 Last night and sometimes…
17:53:34 Access-a-Ride is a bit late. Last night, my
17:53:39 window was 4 to 4.30.
17:53:41 And then they finally picked me up at about 6.30.
17:53:45 Or six o'clock or something pretty late.
17:53:49 from my office in Boulder to Longmont. And I was
17:53:54 thinking maybe it would be helpful to have like
17:53:59 I don't know how this would be possible, but like an ability to like cover
17:54:03 an Uber when Access-a-Ride is late because it really threw off my work schedule and I had to change it
because I'm hourly. So I was at work for longer.
17:54:13 like almost two hours longer than two hours longer
17:54:17 I was expecting to be at work for and it's really hard to plan when things like that happen.
17:54:21 I feel bad for the drivers because they're
17:54:24 you know they're trying, but that's an idea and then um
17:54:29 Multiple stops are helpful. I know that that's not like
17:54:33 for now a thing but now a thing
17:54:36 I just took a trip to the post office and then I took a trip back. I waited.
17:54:41 for the guy to like circle around and there was some traffic
17:54:46 but um

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:53:04 Yeah. Hi, Sarah. Go ahead and

17:54:48 If I was paying $4.50 for like an upfront for each trip, it would be $9.
17:54:55 for like a trip to the post office and back, which is kind of
17:54:59 that's kind of a lot. And then like

Packet Pg. 312

1.F.1.b

17:55:03 that's like, and then it's a tip and it's it's just better for safety if there is a possibility of someday doing a
multiple stop.

17:55:13 Thank you, guys.
17:55:15 Thanks, Sarah. Good to see you again.
17:55:16 Awesome. Thank you, Sarah.
17:55:16 Good to see you.
17:55:18 Appreciate your feedback.
17:55:22 Next up, we have Jack T.
17:55:30 You hear me now.
17:55:32 Yes.
17:55:32 Yeah. Hi, Jack. Please share your comments.
17:55:36 Well, I have a number of comments.
17:55:39 Probably the first one that doesn't have any complaints.
17:55:43 Could be because there was a time when I was much younger, I sold RTD all their computers.
17:55:49 And I know that you guys never make any money.
17:55:53 Anyway, but…
17:55:55 The point is…
17:55:58 When you…
17:56:01 Uber.
17:56:04 to access the rep.
17:56:07 like my life
17:56:10 open i couldn't before i would you can't possibly know when you're going to a doctor
17:56:16 Or you're going to London. You can't know
17:56:19 When do you want to go back home?
17:56:22 Right.
17:56:22 I was either waiting for hours for a ride home or else it got there before I wanted to.
17:56:27 And this Uber is so much better. I mean, I love it. And I've also wondered why we
17:56:34 You weren't charging bother me at all.
17:56:38 And the 30 rides I don't think I've ever taken more than 30, but I may have.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:55:11 Option. Okay. Yeah, that's it.

17:56:42 once or twice. But I've been using Uber for a year or more.
17:56:46 I am very, very happy with it.
17:56:51 I think a couple of times I went over

17:56:54 limit and had to pay something more than the 25
17:56:57 And that wasn't a problem i don't a problem

17:57:03 is what's this enrollment about established AAR customer? I am that, aren't I?
17:57:09 No, you're not able to talk to me. I'm sorry.
17:57:13 Anyway.
17:57:15 I'm…
17:57:17 Very happy with the service. I don't want to see it leave.
17:57:20 $4.50 doesn't bother me at all.
17:57:23 30 trips. What happens after the 30?
17:57:27 If you have 31 and 32…
17:57:29 Is it a higher rate or I just can't get it?
17:57:32 That would be a good question.
17:57:35 And that's all I got to say.
17:57:37 Thank you.
17:57:39 Thank you.
17:57:38 Awesome, Jack. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your comments.
17:57:44 Let's try to see if we can get Kathy Reid again.
17:58:03 Hi, Kathy. Are you able to hear us?
17:58:13 We are unfortunately not able to hear you.
17:58:17 Kathy, you might want to try to go to your audio
17:58:21 Settings, there's a little carrot next to the mute and unmute button.
17:58:28 Are we hearing you now?
17:58:32 If not, try to toggle it to some other setting. You might have more than one microphone.
17:58:47 I'll just jump back to you.
17:58:49 Oh, let's ask her to unmute again.
17:58:53 And if we can't get your comments on the audio.
17:58:56 Don't forget there is a QA option in the command bar at the bottom where you can type a message.
17:59:04 So we definitely want comment.
17:59:06 And that is also available.

17:57:00 The only thing that bothers me and I'm concerned about

17:59:21 Hi, Kathy, can you hear us?

Packet Pg. 314

1.F.1.b

17:59:22 All right.

17:59:42 And I will call on Donna next.
17:59:45 Donna, are you able to…
17:59:48 Hear me?
17:59:49 Hello.
17:59:50 Hi, Donna.
17:59:50 Hi, Donna.
17:59:52 For the first thing is, please, could you please
17:59:55 clarify, did you say that
17:59:59 It's going to be a requirement.
18:00:02 that we use Access-a-Ride.
18:00:05 for some period of time.
18:00:07 before we can use access on demand.
18:00:11 Next year?
18:00:11 That would be for new users.
18:00:14 Oh, okay. Okay. I understand. Then I have a couple of comments.
18:00:21 I used to use Access-a-Ride.
18:00:24 I'm disabled. I have disabled.
18:00:27 a very difficult time.
18:00:29 I'm writing on the assessor ride buses.
18:00:32 Because it's so uncomfortable and they're so bumpy.
18:00:35 I have significant back issues.
18:00:38 It's very painful for me.
18:00:40 So when Access on Demand.
18:00:43 was offered, I jumped at it.
18:00:46 I never use.
18:00:48 30 trips a month.
18:00:51 But my doctors, Ivy.

17:59:29 We are unfortunately not able to hear you, Kathy. So if you would like to drop your comments into the
Q&A, we'll be able to capture them that way.

18:00:53 In Commerce City. And I've had to go to Longmont for some testing
18:00:58 And I also have
18:01:01 to a specialist in the golden area.

Packet Pg. 315

1.F.1.b

18:01:03 So I traveled quite a distance.
18:01:07 So that being said.

18:01:15 And Longmont, I had Access-a-Ride ride.
18:01:19 It took me
18:01:21 55 minutes to get to my appointment.
18:01:24 Then I used accessible ride to get to an appointment in golden
18:01:28 It took me two and a half hours to get there.
18:01:31 It's just unacceptable service.
18:01:35 I understand that access a ride
18:01:38 You know, you pick people up on the way and drop people off and
18:01:42 so forth but gosh two and a half hours
18:01:45 to go across town.
18:01:48 When I can go to a different town in less time than not.
18:01:51 So I feel like Access-on-Demand service
18:01:57 Uber or Lyft or the taxi services.
18:02:00 are so important.
18:02:02 for people like us.
18:02:05 You know, they offer quick service
18:02:10 you're able to get into a comfortable vehicle.
18:02:15 not be…
18:02:18 her, you know, hurt physically on a bus ride
18:02:22 And it's private.
18:02:25 and um
18:02:27 I have gained so much benefit from having that service. So thank you very much for that.
18:02:32 about the $4.50 charge. I don't have a problem with that.
18:02:39 It's just that i i don't.
18:02:44 get to the bank to have cash.
18:02:47 So.
18:02:49 Is that something that could be put on my card for payment?

18:01:12 I just want to say that I had an appointment

1.F.1.b

18:03:02 Okay.
18:02:57 Kathy, I hate to interrupt you, but we're at time and we do have quite a few people in the queue.

18:03:09 Well, Brandon, if you could move on to the next caller. And thanks for your comments, Donna.
18:03:14 Thank you, Donna. Next up, we have Zach.
18:03:25 Hi, can you hear me?
18:03:27 I can, Zach, please go ahead and share your comments.
18:03:30 All right. Thank you. I said, you know, my name is first and foremost, Zachary Alston, and I have a
mental disability
18:03:38 To be clear, I have an anxiety disorder and I don't mind disclosing that.
18:03:42 You know, and truth be told, I don't think I would have a you know um
18:03:48 a use if the proposed recommendations were to be accepted
18:03:52 it would cause a lot of readjusting not just for me but
18:03:55 you know for everybody in the every participant in this program, I can imagine you know
18:04:00 In the past, I've dealt with extreme agoraphobia
18:04:04 And the freedom to like go places like needed places like the grocery store and to work.
18:04:11 With the proposed recommendations, it just wouldn't be, it's not affordable
18:04:16 uh you know for not to mention
18:04:19 you know such a drastic change you know uh this service um i think someone else said it's been very
liberating. It's been very liberating for me.
18:04:29 Also, and it truly has changed the trajectory of my life. I was able to go places and get out of the house,
which was very difficult.
18:04:38 And without this service.
18:04:40 I wouldn't have been able to.
18:04:43 You know, I personally recommended a lot of people to this program and um
18:04:47 other people that struggle like me and didn't have access to the transportation, you know, like, you know,
going on the bus, there's a
18:04:55 could be a lot it could be a lot
18:04:58 And again, I just want to be very clear that these changes, these proposed recommendations.
18:05:04 are drastic changes, you know, that will have drastic consequences for
18:05:09 everybody that's a current participant.
18:05:10 of this program. And in the past have used this to go to work

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

18:03:04 But I appreciate your comments.

18:05:16 five times a week, you know, with their proposed changes, I wouldn't be able to do that.
18:05:21 Not to mention be able to afford to do that.

Packet Pg. 317

1.F.1.b

18:05:23 Being that I'm on a fixed income and a lot of people have disabilities that are in this program.
18:05:32 Thank you for your comments, Zach.

18:05:42 But one of the things that I have heard is financial issues as part of this.
18:05:49 I would like to remind everybody that part of the program recommendations are to charge a reduced fare
for those who are in our live customer fair program itself.
18:06:00 So $4.50 would be a base fare for individuals, but those who qualify for the LIB program would pay
$2.25. The $2.25 live program, there are requirements and it is a low income based program.
18:06:16 But if there are financial challenges.
18:06:19 you may want to look into our live customer program and you can call our customer care line and they
can help provide more information on how to get enrolled in that program.
18:06:32 Excellent point, Fred. Thank you.
18:06:35 And next up, we have Catris.
18:06:52 Hey, Chris, can you unmute yourself?
18:07:02 Can you hear me?
18:07:04 Yes.
18:07:04 Yeah. Hi, Catrice. Please share your comments.
18:07:06 So do you need to come on?
18:07:10 I was doing dishes. Sorry, and I'm getting ready for something. Anyway, thank you for answering.
18:07:15 My comment is, I just have a clarifying question real quick. Did you say these changes will start around
May next year?
18:07:22 Yes, May 2025.
18:07:24 Okay. I just want to comment and say it's been very liberating for me.
18:07:31 I became visually impaired about 20 years ago and started with the accessory ride
18:07:37 But this has allowed me to go to church, go to the grocery store, go get my medication and not have to
wait an hour, et cetera, like that.
18:07:47 And I'm hoping that the on-demand program can
18:07:50 Please continue. I'm wondering, when you say the $4.25 or the $2.25, so in the upward is now, so it'll
start off with a base like that
18:08:01 with what you're saying and then and then RTD will cover the rest is that correct?
18:08:08 The recommendation is $4.50 base fare, $2.25 for live customers
18:08:13 And then a subsidy up to $30. After $30.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

18:05:36 You know, Brandon, I know that we're not here to answer a lot of questions

18:08:18 the individual would be responsible for covering the rest of the fare.
18:08:22 Okay. Well, I'm really hoping you can stay in effect and um
18:08:28 I guess once you guys make a decision, all of us will get a notice probably around

Packet Pg. 318

1.F.1.b

18:08:33 Was it February or March and let us know what the decision was

18:08:39 and um okay but for right now, I'm hoping you all do take that in consideration about the independence it
provides for people like myself and those that are on today.
18:08:49 And also, if there's a consideration of other funding sources that can help
18:08:54 or ways that can help. And it sounds like you have considered that.
18:08:57 Last thing I just want to clarify the lift. Are you saying lift program, L-I-V-E or LIFT or…
18:09:04 Right.
18:09:04 L-I-V-E.
18:09:04 L-I-V-E live.
18:09:07 Yeah.
18:09:07 Yeah.
18:09:06 Okay. And it goes by you. Okay. Thank you.
18:09:10 Thank you, Catrice. Appreciate you taking the time to join us tonight.
18:09:14 Thank you.
18:09:16 Brandon, again, I want to interject one more comment to
18:09:21 I think I made it clear that the program as it stands is going to have to change and that it is not
operationally or fiscally sustainable.
18:09:31 It is not our goal, though, to make this program go away.
18:09:35 we understand that this is a very important program, that it provides independence to individuals
18:09:41 And it gives individuals alternatives that they may not have. So we are doing everything we can to
salvage this program, not to make it go away. And I just want everybody to understand that.
18:09:54 Brandon, if you could go on to the next caller, I believe it's Anah Heath.
18:09:59 Yeah. And are you able to unmute?
18:10:05 Hi there.
18:10:04 Hi there. Thank you for the opportunity to speak.
18:10:09 I do have a couple of comments.
18:10:11 But first, I would like a question to ask a question
18:10:15 So the 30
18:10:17 allowance, I mean, not percent dollar allowance
18:10:21 Does it come after the $4.50 fee?

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

18:08:38 Yes.

18:10:26 Yes, it would come after the $4.50 base fare.
18:10:30 Okay, so from what I remember from the report, the report stated that on average.

Packet Pg. 319

1.F.1.b

18:10:37 the fair or the uber rides at this point
18:10:42 I don't remember exactly the number, but I think it was between $12 and $17. Is that not correct?

18:10:53 Okay. All right. Anyway, so, okay, I'll just do a comment.
18:10:58 So from the report, that's the information I gathered. And I'm just feeling like
18:11:05 puddings are $30, which probably will be at the 34.50 at this point is not realistic because even though
the funds will be counted
18:11:14 And at the end of the day, you'll say we're allocating you know let's say $10 million to this program for
example
18:11:22 even though you know that's true, you also know that a percentage of that money is not going to get
spent
18:11:28 Because from past history
18:11:31 you know um average rights being between $12 and 17 dollars so
18:11:35 I would really highly encourage you to look at
18:11:39 being realistic
18:11:41 And going off of the numbers that we have received and that we have rather than
18:11:47 Just having a higher
18:11:50 amount per ride
18:11:52 because the majority of the rides really never covered that amount.
18:11:59 Okay. Thank you.
18:12:00 Thank you for your feedback.
18:12:04 All right. Up next, we have Alice.
18:12:11 Hi.
18:12:11 Hi, Alice. Please share your comments.
18:12:14 Thank you. My name is Alice Dent.
18:12:17 And my comment, I'm listening to other participants and you guys.
18:12:23 And it pretty much…
18:12:25 I have the same thing to say is that
18:12:29 $4.50 or $2.
18:12:32 25 cents.
18:12:33 upfront fee like everybody else, I'm on a fixed income i don't have

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

18:10:51 We're really not here to answer questions as we…

18:12:39 I'm self-sufficient. I'm on my own.
18:12:42 So with the share RAD if you share

Packet Pg. 320

1.F.1.b

18:12:45 If I need to go pick my prescriptions up.
18:12:48 I have to go to the pharmacist, get out

18:12:58 So then it'll make it harder and more money because I have to
18:13:05 schedule a return trip.
18:13:06 So even if the $2.25 to do that
18:13:10 that would turn that into $4.50.
18:13:13 For somebody like myself.
18:13:16 Like everybody else.
18:13:18 until the Access-on-Demand part came
18:13:22 I couldn't go anywhere. I couldn't go to the store.
18:13:26 I now even try to go and do some silver sneakers some
18:13:31 It's chair yoga just to keep myself moving and active.
18:13:36 Before this, I could do nothing.
18:13:40 And I appreciate what you guys have done. And I understand money's an issue.
18:13:45 I do, but I do.
18:13:47 Maybe there's something else that
18:13:50 a group of us could help come up with
18:13:54 you know just i don't know, maybe we can only take so many trips a week or I don't know but
18:14:00 That's my comment as well. I thank you guys and
18:14:05 I just don't have the money and I'll have to go back to
18:14:09 Not going anywhere again. I'll be in the house again.
18:14:13 which is not your issue but
18:14:16 Thank you. You know I also, brother.
18:14:17 Thank you for your comments, Alice.

18:12:54 get my prescriptions because you can't do a round trip ride

18:14:36 RTD Access-a-Ride or
18:14:38 Access-on-Demand i have access on demand

Packet Pg. 321

1.F.1.b

18:14:42 I've done like day program, directed a day program where individuals have used
18:14:48 the service and personally have three brothers with disabilities who

18:14:58 I would just like to emphasize that the RTD like Access-a-Ride
18:15:03 is pretty unreliable. It sounds like a lot of people have experienced that where
18:15:09 you have to you have like a window
18:15:12 that the bus is supposed to show up and it doesn't.
18:15:15 And so I would just like to really just
18:15:18 kind of point that out again that it's
18:15:20 pretty much unreliable as far as like
18:15:23 having a scheduled ride and somebody getting there on time, people waiting, I mean, up to like two
hours. I've seen my clients, you know.
18:15:31 in the past wait up to two hours for the ride to show up.
18:15:34 And when you have something like X axis on demand, you know, it's through like a Uber, a Lyft, which is
really
18:15:41 I mean, they're within like five, seven minutes
18:15:44 of when you put the request in, it's just so reliable.
18:15:49 And so…
18:15:51 I think it's just interesting
18:15:55 how
18:15:56 that that you know Access-on-Demand may be like
18:16:00 cost more or less rides.
18:16:04 And then like having us to use something like RTD, you know, Access-a-Ride is a little bit less reliable
18:16:12 And so I just wanted to
18:16:14 kind of point that out. I did like some points that were made by like Sarah, Michelle, like if you know if
Access-a-Ride
18:16:20 doesn't show up within the window that they are supposed to, you know, for us to be able to use Accesson-Demand and maybe not pay for that.
18:16:30 Because it's technically on
18:16:33 You know?
18:16:34 on the RTD Access-a-Ride not showing there on time. So I just feel like there still needs to be
18:16:40 a little bit more discussion on a better way to solve the issues.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

18:16:47 Thank you.
18:16:50 Next up, we have Jordan.

18:16:58 Yeah. Hi, Jordan. Please share your comment.
18:17:00 Hi, this is Jordan Castor.
18:17:03 I would like to…
18:17:05 I had some comments about you know
18:17:07 What if there was like 40 trips a month?
18:17:10 to get someone to and from work. The average rides are $12 to 17 dollars
18:17:15 you know if we had 40 rides at 20
18:17:19 that might be at least enough to get someone to and from work. I'd also like to add
18:17:25 a thought about allocating Lyft and Uber vouchers
18:17:30 for specific sets of money for the rides each month.
18:17:34 And then users can use that.
18:17:36 how they see fit. So let's say you allocate a user a voucher of $300. Okay, well, that user can then
18:17:45 use those rides
18:17:47 however they see fit see fit. A lot of my rides are around $9. That leaves
18:17:53 the rest of that money towards the $25 being unused at this moment and
18:18:00 that could increase
18:18:02 the usefulness and the ride count. My other comment is that
18:18:07 when you are a blind working professional such as myself.
18:18:11 You need to be on time for work. You can't be showing up to work two and a half hours, two hours.
18:18:18 late like that's not acceptable. That's cause
18:18:21 for termination and so for termination and so
18:18:23 Access a ride is not reliable in that
18:18:29 form. My ride to work is seven minutes in an uber
18:18:32 And to think that it could take me up to two hours
18:18:36 getting to work late or two hours on a vehicle to get to work, it's just not acceptable.
18:18:43 Finally, when I've used Access-a-Ride in the past, I've been sent a wheelchair equipped vehicle and I was
the only person on the vehicle and I am ambulatory.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

18:16:56 Hey there, can you hear me?

18:18:52 And I do not use a wheelchair. So I think that sending the Uber and the Lyft is more cost effective in
terms of not having to send
18:19:01 the entire bus. Thank you.

18:19:19 Hi, thank you so.
18:19:20 Please share your comments.
18:19:21 Thank you so much for your service. Thank you so much for this forum and great comments from
everybody. I really have great empathy and understanding
18:19:30 I've used my Access-on-Demand because I live outside of Access-a-Ride area. I live kind of
18:19:37 in the prairie with them all attached.
18:19:39 And so I have to use Access-on-Demand and I've only used it about 10 times in the last year.
18:19:46 every one of my…
18:19:48 services has exceeded the $25 because I'm so far away from my doctors.
18:19:53 And from medical facilities
18:19:57 So that, you know.
18:19:59 That's just a factor for me personally. It doesn't impact a lot of other people, I'm sure.
18:20:04 But again, I'm grateful for the service i think
18:20:09 You know, there are other adjustments that could conceivably be made to this.
18:20:13 And that would be like…
18:20:16 like we have surge pricing with Uber and Lyft have surge
18:20:19 rates if somebody exceeds their 40s
18:20:22 rides a month or they're 30 rides a month
18:20:25 that then there would be a different fare structure for that.
18:20:29 but not to punish everybody
18:20:31 when some of us like me, I don't use it that much
18:20:35 It would be nice to kind of
18:20:37 balance that out in some fashion.
18:20:40 Again, thank you for this service. It's invaluable. My husband had surgery. He's my transportation. He's
my seeing eye husband.
18:20:49 And he…
18:20:51 could not drive me or help me for several months and I had to rely on the service.

18:21:00 on both sides of the street.
18:21:03 Oh, and your Q&A is not working, by the way.

18:21:07 Thank you. We will definitely look into that. And thank you so much, Sandy, for your comments. We really
appreciate
18:21:13 hearing them and hopefully your husband is
18:21:17 recovering well from his
18:21:18 Thank you. He is, has.
18:21:25 There we go.
18:21:28 All right, give me one second. Brandy, are you able to just double check that the
18:21:31 Q&A function is operational.
18:21:36 I am checking that right now.
18:21:38 Okay.
18:21:38 And if I may, this is Paul Hamilton, and I just checked and it is not working.
18:21:52 Wow.
18:21:54 There we go.
18:21:56 Oh, there we go. Okay.
18:21:57 via post now.
18:21:59 Yeah, it is working now.
18:22:01 Okay, so the chat function is available if you would like to
18:22:06 type year.
18:22:08 comments in.
18:22:10 So I do see chat coming across now on the Q&A.
18:22:15 Those of you who would like to use that, please do so. I see Roxanne
18:22:20 So she doesn't have a microphone or camera. So please feel free to
18:22:24 While we still have some time left to submit your comments in there.
18:22:29 Okay.
18:22:29 Absolutely. And so next up, we have jerry
18:22:39 Thank you. I'm listening to all the comments. I think they're very good comments and I guess I got to
say, I can't drive.
18:22:49 due to conditions I've got, but

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

18:21:06 Really? Okay. That's…

18:22:51 The $4.50 is a lot.
18:22:53 Especially if I'm just going to go to the grocery store

Packet Pg. 325

1.F.1.b

18:22:57 And then I called a car. It's going to cost me $9 to go
18:23:01 and get back on using on-demand.

18:23:12 But my question is, even if I could afford that or I can't accept it on a given day.
18:23:18 My question is, is that going to be
18:23:22 where it is where it is
18:23:23 deducted from my
18:23:25 bank card that I use like with Lyft or Uber or on-demand accounts, that's what I'm interested in mostly.
18:23:32 And then I'll check on the live customer thing to see if I qualify for that.
18:23:38 But I'm interested to see if that can come off of the account like that.
18:23:42 That's all I had. Thank you.
18:23:45 Thank you, Jerry.
18:23:45 Thank you, Jared.
18:23:56 All right. I see one more hand raised. So Zach.
18:24:01 You've got two minutes, my friend and uh
18:24:04 If anyone else is interested in speaking.
18:24:07 now would be the opportunity to raise your hand or drop your comments in the chat.
18:24:14 Thank you. And I do apologize. You know, shortly after I got off, can you hear me before I begin?
18:24:20 Yeah, yeah.
18:24:21 Yes.
18:24:20 Okay, great. Yeah, shortly before I got off, you know, I think that, you know, you said like the program
isn't going anywhere.
18:24:27 I want to be very clear that the program is going somewhere. I was attempting to write this in a cues and
answer.
18:24:34 questions and answers just so like this narrative can be expressed and explained properly more or less
18:24:41 that like this the proposed recommendations, if they were to go through, would make this program
essentially not the same thing in its entirety.
18:24:51 It would be something completely different.
18:24:53 And it's not just
18:24:56 But me on a personal level, but I mean, this would affect everybody in this program and
18:25:01 I just really hoping.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

18:23:05 And it's the same thing where I go to a doctor's appointment and back, it's $9 either way.

18:25:03 I really wish and uh if there are, I don't know what we could do on a personal level or individually to you
know help offset this if it's, you know.
18:25:13 something to do with the finances you guys are dealing with and whatnot?

Packet Pg. 326

1.F.1.b

18:25:17 But this is going to change things for everybody.
18:25:24 Awesome. Thank you for those

18:25:29 So Brandon, I think we're at the point where we need to wrap it up. We've got one more hand raised.
18:25:37 Let's take one last question and then if you would remind everybody about the process going forward
from here.
18:25:44 And then we'll call it a day and close the session.
18:25:47 Absolutely. So our final commenter is jeff
18:25:53 Can you hear me?
18:25:54 Yeah. Hi, Jeff. Please share your comments.
18:25:58 Hi, I've been using Access-On-Demand for about a year now. It's an invaluable and a wonderful program.
There's always wins and losses.
18:26:07 I've had two hours to get a Dick's test ride. I missed my train to Grand Junction because Access-a-Ride
was
18:26:14 It was a debacle. On demand has messed up too, but I've won more than I've lost. So it's a great
program.
18:26:20 My biggest concern is you take away
18:26:23 the trips and you raise the rate at the same time and you also
18:26:29 you increase the subsidy.
18:26:31 For more people that have a financial
18:26:34 burden for these simple little things, I would think it would make so much more sense to save the money
in the subsidy
18:26:41 realm and drop that to where you could either drop the fare a little bit
18:26:47 Or you could increase the trip cap because
18:26:50 people need to get around so that they aren't so much landlocked into their home.
18:26:56 And that's where my biggest concern is that
18:27:00 60 seems like a lot and sometimes it is. And sometimes I don't use it all and sometimes
18:27:05 I run out at the end of the month
18:27:08 going places and doing things and had to go to the bank and the store and this next thing you know,
there's five in one day and then
18:27:14 I don't go anywhere for two days and I have nothing you know so
18:27:19 I think it's a great program, both sides of it and both sides have

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

18:25:26 Final comments.

18:27:23 of problems and there's always going to be. But I really think
18:27:30 adding the fare, it makes sense. I understand. You have to be fiscally responsible and you have to be able
to maintain it.

Packet Pg. 327

1.F.1.b

18:27:38 I would have an easier time paying that than other people.

18:27:52 and back. And the subsidy, I think, is something you could
18:27:56 maybe reroute back into the other side of it.
18:28:00 Thank you.
18:28:01 Thank you, Gary.
18:28:01 Awesome, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. Appreciate your comments.
18:28:06 So as we wrap up here today, I'm just going to share
18:28:10 Again, the timeline. So we have another public meeting scheduled for tomorrow for individuals who
18:28:16 haven't been able to speak or provide comment, you're welcome to join us tomorrow at noon on Zoom.
18:28:22 We also have another public meeting on January 7th, which will also be
18:28:27 over Zoom, you all are encouraged to visit the RTD-denver website. We have on the Paratransit review
page a feedback form.
18:28:37 Where we're collecting data on your
18:28:40 attitudes and potential uses of the changes.
18:28:45 to Access-a-Ride and access on demand.
18:28:47 And as I mentioned earlier, once the public comment period has closed, it is up to the board of directors
to review the proposed changes.
18:28:56 And make a final determination and any changes that are made will go into effect in May of 2025.
18:29:04 Thank you all for your time and have a great evening.

Public Meeting
Paratransit Peer Review, December 2024 Update
December 12, 2024, 12:00pm

12:00:49 All right. Good evening, everybody, or afternoon. I am going to go ahead and start the recording and
then we will get started
12:00:59 with the meeting. So good afternoon. My name is Brandon Figliolino. I'm the manager of community
engagement here at RTD, and I'm joined by my teammate Fred Worthen, the Assistant General Manager
12:01:11 of bus operations. And so today we are going to be presenting some proposed changes to our Access-aRide and Access-on-Demand programs.
12:01:20 And then at the end of the presentation, you all be given the opportunity to provide public comment.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

18:27:41 But I think trip capping is really hard because that's one trip a day. And if you go places, that means only
15 days can you go place

12:01:26 So I will pass it off to you, Fred, to get us started.
12:01:44 All right.

Packet Pg. 328

1.F.1.b

12:01:47 All right.
12:01:49 Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations.

12:02:00 from the American Public Transit Association Peer Review. I will talk about some of the program and
challenges that we are working on, some proposed changes to the programs, and Brandon will finish with next
steps.
12:02:14 Next slide, please.
12:02:18 two sides should say.
12:02:21 All right.
12:02:24 So RTD’s paratransit program is comprised of our Access-a-Ride service and our supplemental
12:02:30 premium paratransit service, commonly referred to as Access-on-Demand.
12:02:34 Our test ride services are complementary paratransit services
12:02:38 that are conditionally provided to passengers who live within or travel within three quarters of a mile of
RTD's fixed route services or rail stations
12:02:47 due to a disability or mobility barrier as defined within the criteria set forth
12:02:53 by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
12:02:56 These services supplement regular fixed route
12:02:59 services. Customers are required to pay a fare associated with the trip taken
12:03:04 all Access-a-Ride vehicles are branded and 100% accessible.
12:03:08 RTD's Access-on-Demand program is a supplemental premium service that provides curb-to-curb taxi and
rideshare options.
12:03:16 Access-on-Demand services are currently available 24 seven throughout the entire RTD service area
12:03:22 that is eligible and Access-a-Ride customers.
12:03:26 Access-on-Demand customers do not pay an initial upfront fare like they do on regular access ride
services.
12:03:32 RTD pays the first $25 of the customer trip.
12:03:36 Any cost above $25 is paid by the customer.
12:03:39 Customers can take up to 60 total trips per month on any one of four different service providers.
12:03:46 Next slide.
12:03:49 So Access-on-Demand is meant to be a supplemental service that supplements
12:03:54 are Access-a-Ride and fixed route services. It is not meant to be a replacement
12:04:00 for Access-a-Ride. Access-a-Ride services are

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:01:54 Today, I'll be speaking about where we are with regard to recommendations stemming

12:04:04 should be the primary mode used to schedule routine and pre-planned trips.
12:04:09 Our Access-on-Demand program

Packet Pg. 329

1.F.1.b

12:04:11 has grown substantially. When the program started, it was at a cost of approximately $85,000 a month.
12:04:20 When it started as a pilot and it has grown to about $1.2 million a month in expenses.

12:04:34 Next slide, please.
12:04:36 So as I mentioned, Access-on-Demand is a service that's supposed to be supplemental. When it was
originally designed.
12:04:43 It was meant to be something that would fill the gap for individuals. So for example, if you go to a
medical appointment, it's often very hard to know how long it will take in a doctor's office.
12:04:55 you know what your scheduled appointment time is
12:04:57 But it could take a doctor an hour or two.
12:05:00 And it's very hard to schedule a return to an accessory ride
12:05:04 So Access-on-Demand could be used for a return trip or a doctor. There's other also unforeseen
circumstances
12:05:13 having to go for groceries or traveling to work or school or unplanned situations.
12:05:20 And also for shopping, very similar to the doctor's office.
12:05:24 Even if you know when you want to be there, it's hard to tell how long it will take. So access on demand
wasn't meant to be a service that is used daily for going back and forth to work. It was really meant to fill the gap
on our Access-a-Ride services
12:05:40 And to be an emergency type of service.
12:05:44 Next slide, please.
12:05:49 So to help with to help
12:05:53 to help with garnering ways to make the program the Access-on-Demand program more sustainable. A
significant amount of information has been gathered. Sorry, I'm having
12:06:05 something in my throat and a significant amount of information has been gathered and utilized to
formulate paratransit program modifications under
12:06:12 under consideration. Of course, the APTA peer review was conducted and I have done a number of public
meetings that have discussed the recommendations
12:06:21 stemming from the peer review. We've also done industry research utilizing resources such as
12:06:28 transit cooperative research program data. We've collected information from 21 different transit agencies,
and we collect a lot of information from our customers.
12:06:39 We had two customer surveys. We had 387 responses
12:06:43 from a public survey. And then we had 428 responses
12:06:48 from a statistically valid sampling of our customers that use our services on Access-a-Ride and Access-onDemand.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:04:26 This is an unsustainable growth and has unintended induced demand for our services.

12:06:55 We also received 561 comments through our online feedback form and

Packet Pg. 330

1.F.1.b

12:07:01 collected a substantial number of comments during public meetings, one which was in person and two
which were virtual.

12:07:13 So this is the slide that is the real meat and potatoes of the presentation.
12:07:19 After considering customer feedback, a regression analysis was conducted on the customer survey
12:07:25 Our customer program usage data and other factors.
12:07:29 to help develop
12:07:31 the programmatic changes that we're proposing for consideration with regard to Access-on-Demand
12:07:39 First, we're recommending that customers pay base fare equivalent to the fare paid on access a ride
services.
12:07:45 This includes a $4.50 base fare for customers or a reduced fare of $2.25.
12:07:51 for live customers. And for those of you who are not familiar with the LIVE program itself, I'm not going
to go into
12:08:00 a great deal of detail, but the lift program was designed for individuals that have a limited income.
12:08:08 In particular, those who were low income and meet the program
12:08:14 requirements, they're eligible for a discount. Many individuals that use our Access-a-Ride and Access-onDemand programs
12:08:22 are potentially eligible for the live program discount. If you're not familiar with the LIV program, you can
call our customer care
12:08:32 And they can give you information on how the program works and how to get enrolled
12:08:38 So again, we're looking at a base fare of $4.50.
12:08:43 with $2.25 for our live customers.
12:08:46 we're looking to modify the trip cap from 60 to 30.
12:08:51 So the trip cap would be 30 per month
12:08:55 with a subsidy per ride of thirty dollars
12:08:57 And our ADA service area and service hours would mirror the Access-on-Demand service area and service
hours.
12:09:06 So I'm sorry, I said that backwards.
12:09:08 The Access-on-Demand will mirror our ADA service area and service hours.
12:09:14 We are also recommending that new riders
12:09:19 must be enrolled in and become an established Access-a-Ride customer.
12:09:24 individuals would need to be enrolled in the program for 90 days and have used the

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:07:09 Next slide, please.

12:09:29 Access-a-Ride services.
12:09:31 on average at least
12:09:33 the same amount of trips as our average customer usage is.

Packet Pg. 331

1.F.1.b

12:09:37 We're also looking at program modifications such as modifying our suspension program.
12:09:44 and policy. And we're also looking at incentivizing our transportation network companies

12:09:53 Next slide, please.
12:09:58 Sorry, I have something in my throat. I apologize.
12:10:06 So utilizing survey information and customer feedback
12:10:10 Stamp is also looking at a number of program changes or enhancements for our Access-a-Ride program.
12:10:16 This includes changing recertifications from
12:10:19 four years to five.
12:10:21 On-time performance will be modified to measure pickup and drop off metrics.
12:10:26 And we are also exploring software modifications to support changes in service provision
12:10:31 and to provide productivity enhancements
12:10:34 And among those, we're not only looking at improving our on-time performance.
12:10:40 But we're also looking at reducing the amount of time individuals spend on a vehicle.
12:10:46 There will also be modifications to the conditional eligibility process.
12:10:50 And we are exploring contract modifications
12:10:54 as well as modifications to the existing suspension policy, as I mentioned before
12:10:59 And finally, we're working on developing a fleet procurement plan to procure smaller vehicles
12:11:06 such as sedans and minivans.
12:11:06 So ultimately, we hope to have a pilot program where we have a mix of sedans, vans, and
12:11:15 our existing paratransit type vehicles.
12:11:18 And with that, I'll turn it over to Brandon to go through our next steps.
12:11:23 Excellent. Thank you, Fred, for taking the time to go over the proposed changes.
12:11:29 So I'm going to just talk a little bit about our engagement and outreach timeline. So in November of 2024,
12:11:36 RTD staff shared all customer feedback received to date with the RTD board of directors.
12:11:44 And provided an initial set of recommendations
12:11:48 for program modifications.
12:11:49 Now that we're in December and January, we are hosting some public comment periods.
12:11:55 Including this meeting today to gather feedback on the proposed changes.
12:12:01 We've also launched an online feedback tool, which is available by visiting RTV's paratransit website.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:09:50 to provide more wheelchair accessible vehicles.

12:12:08 And it allows you to identify the
12:12:13 benefits and the pain points with the proposed changes.

Packet Pg. 332

1.F.1.b

12:12:17 In January, we'll send out another communication informing of the closure of the public comment period
and we'll close the feedback tool.

12:12:27 we will be working with our board of directors to come up with a final recommendation. And once the
board of directors has approved the final version of changes.
12:12:39 Those changes will be implemented in May as part of our traditional service change process.
12:12:46 So now we would like to open it up for the opportunity for customers to provide public comment.
12:12:53 So how this will work today is customers who wish to provide verbal feedback should raise their virtual
hand, which is located in the bottom navigation bar under the React.
12:13:04 button has a little heart on it. Just raise your hand and we will call on you to provide your comment.
12:13:11 We ask that you start by stating your first and last name for the public record.
12:13:16 You'll have two minutes to provide your comments.
12:13:19 After two minutes have expired, there'll be a little chime.
12:13:22 At that point, please wrap up your comments so that way we can move to the next person.
12:13:27 We do have just 46 minutes for this meeting. And so we want to make sure we get through as many
comments as possible.
12:13:34 So as such, we won't be responding as staff or answering questions. This is simply your time to provide
feedback on what
12:13:42 the proposed changes are and how they will impact you.
12:13:46 Customers who are unable to verbalize their comments or are uncomfortable doing so are encouraged to
12:13:53 provide written comments. We do have on the bottom navigation bar
12:13:59 Q&A function where again, you can drop in your comments
12:14:04 or considerations. And similarly with the verbal comments, we won't be responding to those comments,
but we are capturing all of this information
12:14:13 And we'll provide it to the board of directors as we move the process along.
12:14:19 And then just some…
12:14:22 some comments or comments
12:14:24 rules of engagement. Please be respectful with your comments. We know that we're all people here and
we want what's best for everybody. So please be respectful in your comments.
12:14:35 And to ensure that there is adequate time for everyone to provide their comment, we ask that you limit
your comments to that two minute threshold.
12:14:44 And shortly wrap up your comments if you hear that chime.
12:14:49 One hour is scheduled for this meeting. And so once that hour has ended.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:12:23 And then for the first quarter of 2025,

12:14:54 We will be closing the public meeting, but there will be an additional opportunity in January to provide
public comment through another public meeting. And we also have our website that has that feedback form, which
will be open until January 17th.

1.F.1.b

12:15:10 And so at this point.
12:15:13 I am going to go back oops

12:15:18 that has the proposed recommendations.
12:15:21 So we can all see that.
12:15:24 And I will call on our first speaker, Mary.
12:15:29 Mary, would you like to…
12:15:32 Unmute and provide comment today.
12:15:34 Yes, hello. Thank you. My name is Mary Kenneth.
12:15:36 Hi, good morning.
12:15:37 Hi, good morning. Afternoon.
12:15:40 Afternoon, yes.
12:15:43 My name is Mary Hennick. I am the parent of a young adult who uses Access-on-Demand as a critical
12:15:52 element of him being fully employed.
12:15:55 I'd like to start by saying that every time I see a presentation, it seems that
12:16:02 You're making up excuses after the fact for why, or I should say reasons, for why Access-on-Demand was
implemented in the first place.
12:16:11 The slides continue, it seems, from my perspective to
12:16:18 to make up reasons for why it was implemented so that it can be cut.
12:16:24 This is my perception.
12:16:28 the real reason that Access-on-Demand was implemented was because it's a cheaper alternative to
Access-a-Ride. We know that the per trip fares for Access-a-Ride are about, you know, I'm not going to get the
numbers right, but about $60 a ride.
12:16:45 If we look at
12:16:47 Access-on-Demand, the numbers are much lower and I don't have them right in front of me, but rarely
do.
12:16:55 trips meet the trip cap, so it's much less than that.
12:16:59 And the second reason that Access-on-Demand has been implemented is that Access-a-Ride simply does
not work.
12:17:07 as a means of transportation for
12:17:11 people to get to and from work.
12:17:14 With the proposed changes to Access-on-Demand

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:15:16 to the slide deck.

12:17:18 My son will be paying about $200 a month to get to and from work.
12:17:23 I feel that these proposed changes

1.F.1.b

12:17:27 are basically pulling the rug out from under him. The reason he was able to get a job and get
12:17:32 Full-time employment as a disabled young adult was because he had Access-on-Demand

12:17:43 And I thank you for the opportunity to speak.
12:17:46 Thank you, Mary. We appreciate your comments today.
12:17:51 Next up, we have Isaac.
12:17:54 Isaac, would you like to provide comment today?
12:18:04 Yes. Good afternoon.
12:18:06 Hi, Isaac.
12:18:09 Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to provide feedback this afternoon.
12:18:14 So my primary concerns
12:18:18 with the Access-on-Demand
12:18:22 proposed changes might be the opportunity for
12:18:26 others, especially in the disabled community to find
12:18:30 and maintain meaningful employment.
12:18:33 So, and especially if say they are outside
12:18:37 their employer is outside of an ada zone
12:18:40 Or they might be required to work
12:18:45 let's just say on hours in which
12:18:49 fixed bus service may not be available to him or her.
12:18:55 And I am also concerned about, say, if the individual
12:19:01 signed a non-compete agreement or signed a
12:19:04 a four-star arbitration agreement when they get uh
12:19:07 when they started their employment when they started their employment
12:19:10 if they are forced to quit their job because of the proposed changes.
12:19:15 the individual or individuals might not be
12:19:18 able to find employment in their field
12:19:22 for at least averages go from one to two years and for
12:19:26 most individuals not having a job is not an option.
12:19:32 Thank you.

12:19:38 Next up, we have Reem.
12:19:50 Hi, Reem, can you hear me?
12:19:52 Can you hear me?
Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:19:53 Yes, please share your comments.
12:19:54 Yes.
12:19:55 Yeah, thank you so much.
12:19:59 for so
12:20:01 Would that be like, I know because we used to have access
12:20:04 Oh, sorry.
12:20:07 Can you hear me?
12:20:09 Yes.
12:20:10 Yes.
12:20:10 Okay, so Access ACAD, is that still going to be an option where we can
12:20:16 you know use a taxi
12:20:19 For that.
12:20:22 the excessive care program was replaced by Access-on-Demand
12:20:28 Oh, it wasn't replacing.
12:20:30 Yes.
12:20:32 Okay, so is that going to be back?
12:20:35 Like…
12:20:36 No.
12:20:39 Okay, so there's only going to be the Access-on-Demand
12:20:43 Yes.
12:20:43 Okay. Any other feedback, have you considered like
12:20:49 maybe putting 60 trips and then
12:20:53 you know removing the other options like priority pickups you know excel
12:20:58 Because I think many people
12:21:00 they might be using these options and it could be, you know, it's called like
12:21:05 tons of money. So I was just curious to know
12:21:08 you know hear your thoughts regarding that
12:21:13 I'm not going to be providing feedback at this point because I want to give everybody opportunity to
speak.
12:21:19 But are there other comments that you have?

Packet Pg. 336

1.F.1.b

12:21:23 No, that's sorry. I should say that's just a consideration like that's my feedback. I think
12:21:28 If possible, I think it would be a huge help to like put 60

12:21:36 I think you know because i think because
12:21:38 for people who work full time, I think that might be a barrier
12:21:41 So even if it's the same raids
12:21:44 it would still be an option for people you know to like
12:21:48 to use the service.
12:21:51 Thank you.
12:21:53 Yeah.
12:21:52 Awesome, Reem. Thank you for your comment today.
12:21:55 Yeah, thank you.
12:21:58 Sure.
12:22:00 Carice, I have you up next.
12:22:09 Hi.
12:22:06 Hi, I'm Cara Slather. I had a couple of things I wanted to say first. I was really proud of you guys when
you implemented this program. I have to say that it was the first time
12:22:17 in pretty much the entire time that I've been blinded, I felt like a truly independent person. I was able to
get where I needed to go in a timely manner and all of that.
12:22:25 Whereas with your Access-a-Ride services, my biggest barrier with that was largely time and I could not
12:22:31 get to and from things in a consistent manner
12:22:34 in a consistent amount of time rather
12:22:36 to be able to
12:22:39 do what I needed to do in a timely basis.
12:22:42 That said, I do have some questions.
12:22:46 One of those being one of those
12:22:47 what you're going to do about the voucher system. I know I myself as a single person with my guide dog,
I've been denied rides by Uber. This is not your responsibility, but
12:22:57 In each of those instances.
12:22:59 I have…
12:23:01 reported it and the refund has gone back to RTD. And yet I do not get a voucher back. And that's more
than $1,500 myself that I have given back to RTD because of reporting my guy dog denials.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:21:32 trips, even if paying for 50

12:23:12 that I did not get the voucher back for. So I'm curious whether you're going to fix that.

Packet Pg. 337

1.F.1.b

12:23:16 Also, I'm curious whether you're going to be allowing unused vouchers to be able to wrap to the next
month rather than expiring

12:23:29 the individuals with disabilities and that need accessibility
12:23:34 you know only need so many problems a month. That's really not how that works.
12:23:39 And another thing is that
12:23:42 I am curious whether i am curious whether
12:23:46 you are looking into how you're going to help people who
12:23:49 lose their ability to have access rider Access-on-Demand because RTD takes away
12:23:55 a bus stop and then they're outside of the zone to receive either one of those options when they moved
there in the first place.
12:24:01 How are we going to deal with that situation? Because that is not their fault when RTD changes are out.
12:24:05 So I'd love to see that be figured out as well.
12:24:09 So that's kind of my main things but um
12:24:12 I love that you implemented this, but I also think you need to keep in mind that it's not realistic to
consider that
12:24:21 You know, it only being for one thing is plausible.
12:24:24 Thank you.
12:24:25 Thank you.
12:24:25 Thank you so much for your comment.
12:24:27 So Brandon, real quick, Carice, I know that we're not getting into conversations today.
12:24:33 But when you have problems with denials of service, make sure you're calling our call center
12:24:38 as well as the provider
12:24:41 so that we can assist you with that particular problem. And please report those things to RTD as well. And
I appreciate the feedback.
12:24:54 All right. Up next, we have Tim.
12:25:00 Hi there. Thank you guys for all you do.
12:25:01 Hi, Tim.
12:25:04 Yeah, so as Isaac was saying about employers.
12:25:10 who, you know, I…
12:25:13 I work at the Amazon Sortation Warehouse in Aurora and I work overnight.
12:25:18 um so

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:23:24 And then only be expired by the end of the year because otherwise it perpetuates the idea

12:25:21 The sortation warehouse is, I guess, barely within the service area which i
12:25:26 just found out and now I'm just now

Packet Pg. 338

1.F.1.b

12:25:29 I've booked more access ride trips, but that can get me home.
12:25:33 But it can't get me there since I go at 1.45 in the morning and uh

12:25:42 Because it is pretty far from my home here at First and Broadway.
12:25:46 in denver and uh
12:25:49 you know, I
12:25:51 You've referred to Access-on-Demand, sorry, as a supplemental premium service.
12:25:57 So I don't understand why you hamstring it by the same rules
12:26:01 that Access-a-Ride is ridiculous.
12:26:04 for us to operate under.
12:26:07 That to me, it just doesn't make sense like you know
12:26:11 As far as…
12:26:15 I don't know what the actual stats are about how many people need it off hours and
12:26:20 Outside of that three quarter mile radius, but I bet it's not that many
12:26:24 And so you're not saving a ton of money by doing this so i'm i'm
12:26:29 Or, you know, I don't understand why you are.
12:26:33 um and that the
12:26:34 cutting the trip live in half is just uh
12:26:38 It's just going to, like somebody said, cut the rattle gap from under these people who have built lives and
livelihoods around the existence of this service.
12:26:47 So I'm hoping that, you know, I expected a trip reduction, but, you know, maybe 45
12:26:53 At least something where somebody who works full time could get back and forth to work every day.
12:26:58 without exceeding their trip limit if they have, you know, and of course then they can use excess ride but
12:27:04 I'm really hoping that you guys reconsider the area and ours.
12:27:10 Italy in in
12:27:12 increase that triple a little bit moderation. Thank you.
12:27:16 Thank you.
12:27:16 Thank you, Tim. We appreciate the comments.
12:27:20 Next up, Chelsea.
12:27:28 Hi, Brandon, can you hear me?

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:25:38 That's going to cost $150 a week or so.

12:27:29 Yeah, please share your comments.
12:27:32 Thank you for allowing me to speak. I agree with what
12:27:37 Jim and Chorus have said

Packet Pg. 339

1.F.1.b

12:27:39 already regarding independence and employment.
12:27:43 I'm a person with a disability and just as my lived experience i just

12:27:51 I also have concerns with the proposed
12:27:55 Sorry, lowering my hand. I also have concerns with the proposed
12:28:00 reductions. I've also made living decisions based on the
12:28:05 service and
12:28:08 the two things that came to mind immediately upon hearing the proposal was
12:28:15 So work. So you mentioned that Access-a-Ride would be a
12:28:19 an option to get back and forth to work
12:28:22 Unless the access ride service improves markedly, I can't take that option so
12:28:28 When I had to go to an appointment in the middle of the day, I did use a test ride. I told my supervisor
I'd be back by a certain time and I ended up being back
12:28:37 two hours later and having to
12:28:41 having to work extra to make that time up.
12:28:44 The other thing is one of my jobs, I tutor for university and students can schedule with us up to 24 hours
12:28:53 in advance so as the current system says now
12:28:57 using the access road service would be using service
12:29:00 difficult if I don't see the appointment right when it is scheduled, if it is within that
12:29:06 24-hour window. So I'm concerned about these things from a quality of life
12:29:13 standpoint and from standpoint
12:29:15 a reliability standpoint uh because this
12:29:22 they could mark a decrease independence or in-person work opportunity
12:29:29 Awesome, Chelsea. Thank you so much for your comments today.
12:29:32 Brandon, if I could real quick.
12:29:35 Yes.
12:29:37 As soon as the thing goes past. I appreciate all the comments about the independence that this has
provided.
12:29:44 And I do want to say that
12:29:47 you know our goal is to preserve this program, but we're also here listening to you
12:29:53 And I do hear the things that you're talking about with regard to work and quality of life.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:27:49 wanted to provide that.

12:29:57 So I do want everybody to understand that these were recommendations

Packet Pg. 340

1.F.1.b

12:30:02 They are not final recommendations, though. They were just what was presented preliminary to our
board of directors.

12:30:20 Yes. Thank you so much. I see John.
12:30:30 Okay, can you hear me?
12:30:31 Yeah. Hi, John. Please share your comments.
12:30:33 Hi, thanks. I want to say thanks for
12:30:38 the opportunity to comment.
12:30:40 I am visually disabled and the Access-on-Demand program has just made all the difference.
12:30:48 my life.
12:30:51 And I would really hate to see it diminished. I think the fact that
12:30:58 I think the numbers that are being reported that makes it more expensive
12:31:05 indicate how highly successful this program is and that
12:31:10 we should be looking at.
12:31:12 I don't know why this is not being framed this way, but we should be looking at replacing the Access-onDemand
12:31:20 As someone else spoke to, it's got to be way cheaper.
12:31:24 When you take into account the maintenance and the staff that's required
12:31:29 The drivers, it's just got to be, you know, so many times I've ridden that
12:31:35 As one person, I live in Longmont. It's coming from Aurora.
12:31:39 And going back somewhere like that. It's got to be way cheaper. It's way better for the consumer.
12:31:46 Because we can get to places and come back home
12:31:49 much more quickly.
12:31:53 I think 60 rides.
12:31:56 for people who are employed.
12:31:59 should remain for
12:32:02 people who are unemployed people who are unemployed
12:32:04 You know, it might be reduced to 40
12:32:08 maybe a copayment or 30 and then a copayment of three dollars
12:32:14 beyond those rides.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:30:08 will formulate final recommendations after we finish all the public feedback. But I appreciate all of the
feedback that we're getting. Brandon, you want to take the next person?

12:32:16 We should be looking at negotiating.
12:32:20 You're sending a lot of writers per month to Uber and lyft

Packet Pg. 341

1.F.1.b

12:32:24 good negotiating leverage to
12:32:28 to get a cheaper ride fare from these companies and make this a more successful company.

12:32:39 Thanks, Sean.
12:32:41 Thank you, John. Next, I'll call on Joe.
12:32:48 Joe Triplett.
12:32:50 Yes. Oh, sorry. Joe Triplett.
12:32:56 Jill, can you unmute yourself?
12:33:12 Joe's been having some technical difficulties.
12:33:21 Sure.
12:33:20 All the audio now unmuted. Can you hear me now? This is Joe.
12:33:23 Yes, there you go, Joe.
12:33:24 Hi, Joe. How are you today?
12:33:25 Okay.
12:33:25 Sorry about the technical difficulties you've been having.
12:33:29 Go ahead.
12:33:29 It's going to drop me again.
12:33:34 Maggie has joined the meeting. Okay. And now lowered.
12:33:38 Okay. Can you hear me now?
12:33:41 Yes, we can hear you. Go ahead.
12:33:43 Yes, sir.
12:33:44 Okay, I want to talk about the Access-a-Ride.
12:33:49 Okay, I think Access-on-Demand is great, but you've got several thousand people on Access a Ride.
12:33:55 who cannot use Access-on-Demand.
12:33:58 For one reason or another, like myself.
12:34:01 I've had travel lessons, but my travel skills are not good enough
12:34:06 Access-on-Demand does not require you to get help. They can drop you off at a location and take off.
And if they drop off location, like I'm totally blind, I would never know where I'm at. And sometimes.
12:34:20 I've been told to even drop you off in the middle of a driveway.
12:34:24 And as far as I've heard about accessory.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:32:36 a more successful venture. Thank you.

12:34:29 I haven't heard of any improvements at all. I've heard the same more improvements like
12:34:34 Okay, we're going to get new vehicles. We're going to have on-time performance.

Packet Pg. 342

1.F.1.b

12:34:37 We're going to buy new programs. All of that, I've been with Access a Ride since 2004. I've heard the
same old, same old every single time.

12:34:54 and you want to do a filing transaction, you'd stay there an hour. I think that ought to be lowered to a
half an hour. I think it's…
12:35:00 I think there's very misuse of the service.
12:35:03 And then I think like Access-on-Demand more than what in the Denver area. We can't work. We're very
limited by
12:35:12 You know, we have to be in an area where three or four, was it three or four mile bus stop
12:35:17 I would like that eliminated and give us that same opportunity that you give Access-on-Demand so we
can travel further and it would be, in other words, it would be better for us to be more efficient.
12:35:31 But there are several thousand people on accessorizing it just
12:35:35 cannot use access on amendment because they need…
12:35:40 They need special transportation.
12:35:41 I'm going to need special help.
12:35:44 And I'm one of them. And I feel like I'm being left out.
12:35:46 I feel like I'm being left out because of…
12:35:50 You know, because I can't use access on a man, so I'm limited to Access-a-Ride. So I'd like to see some
real improvements like the two I just suggested.
12:35:59 Thank you very much.
12:36:01 Thank you, Joe.
12:36:00 Thanks, Joe. I apologize for the technical difficulties you were having. Thanks for your comments.
12:36:06 Go ahead, Brandon.
12:36:09 All right. Francie, you are up next.
12:36:19 Hi, this is Francie Kinney from Denver.
12:36:24 I agree with a lot that has been said and will not repeat it.
12:36:29 do things like do things
12:36:31 that I think are one
12:36:35 Access on demand
12:36:38 an excessive cav when it existed
12:36:41 allowed

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:34:48 I would like to see some improvements. For example, when you go from the Colorado Center for the Blind
to the bank.

12:36:45 people that need assistance but
12:36:48 don't have to be on the bus.
12:36:51 to

Packet Pg. 343

1.F.1.b

12:36:52 get around and therefore the people like Joe is saying that
12:36:57 have to be on the bus because of power chairs or whatever this is.

12:37:05 And help with scheduling and not having to be on the buses long.
12:37:10 I myself, I suffer from MS and I am very heat intolerant and when it gets hot.
12:37:15 My symptoms flare badly.
12:37:17 I have had numerous instances where I have stopped actually using the Access-a-Ride bus, especially
during the summer.
12:37:27 Because they…
12:37:28 too warm and I'd be on a bus for over three hours just to get from
12:37:37 Englewood at Hampden and University to get out to Anschutz
12:37:43 And it would take me two or three hours to go two or three hours to come back. They have to shut the
bus off every time they get off.
12:37:49 It is too hot.
12:37:51 And it's very inefficient, the routes.
12:37:55 you know, um.
12:37:57 I think that this is all great proposed changes
12:38:01 However, I feel like you need a cycle of actually
12:38:04 implementing some of your changes on Access-a-Ride to prove they work.
12:38:09 Before cutting this program.
12:38:13 I also would like to say that I believe access on demand is much better for the environment than the
buses.
12:38:23 gives more flexibility. Thank you.
12:38:26 Goodbye.
12:38:28 Thank you, Trent.
12:38:28 Thank you, Francie.
12:38:32 Next up, we have Domasha.
12:38:41 Okay, can you hear me?
12:38:41 Hi, Samantha. Yeah, please share your comments.
12:38:45 Hi. As a former employee of Access-a-Ride, I can relate to what everybody is saying.
12:38:52 using Access-a-Ride, I saw a lot of people missing appointments

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:37:03 could have more use of it.

12:38:56 missing their programs
12:38:59 Because the buses were late even when they had a drop off time. I saw how people utilize a metro taxi,
even some taking advantage of it. Now I use Access-on-Demand. I use my 60 rides per month.

Packet Pg. 344

1.F.1.b

12:39:15 And I think that these proposed changes
12:39:19 would hurt a lot of people. I can see the reduction in the trip may be down to 45.

12:39:32 I see the $30. You could reduce it to 25 to 20.
12:39:38 But to raise it, I don't even…
12:39:40 travel anywhere that does $30.
12:39:43 with Access-on-Demand. As far as the current service area, that's going to hurt a lot of people.
12:39:50 Because if the buses aren't running out there.
12:39:53 they're going to be people stranded.
12:39:56 So I'm hoping that when you do make decisions on the changes.
12:40:03 they will benefit the people who utilize Access-on-Demand.
12:40:08 Thank you. That's all I have to say.
12:40:11 Thank you.
12:40:10 Thank you for your comments today.
12:40:16 All right, moving right along. Next up, we have Brent.
12:40:23 I agree with everything that's been said.

12:41:05 Do these Uber drivers or Uber drivers know that?
12:41:13 When we call…
12:41:16 did they know it's…

12:41:44 go to moops.
12:41:48 No, none of the providers are aware that customers are part of the Access-on-Demand program.

12:41:57 That doubt I have.
12:41:57 Thank you.
12:41:59 Okay.
12:41:59 Thank you, Brent. We appreciate your comments today.
12:42:06 All right. We have…
12:42:10 about 15 minutes left and several hands raised so
12:42:14 Next up is Jacqueline and or jordan.
12:42:21 Hello. Hi.
12:42:22 Hi there.
12:42:23 My comment was my comment was
12:42:26 So…
12:42:27 you know when a person has to go and recertify.
12:42:35 have been in a situation where
12:42:39 My boss left.
12:42:42 came and left before my pickup had even opened.
12:42:46 And I think you guys should make exceptions
12:42:49 For that, if you're going to do the $4.50 base fare, because it's free
12:42:57 For those trips and having to pay
12:43:00 the $4.50 for that it's like
12:43:03 Like, why?
12:43:12 Does that make sense?
12:43:13 So if you want to use Access-on-Demand to do a recertification trip
12:43:19 That should be free.
12:43:22 we will take that into consideration. Thank you.
12:43:26 Thank you.
12:43:32 Up next, I see Chuck.
12:43:41 Hello?

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:41:54 Okay, thank you.

12:43:42 Hi, Chuck. Please share your comments.
12:43:44 Yes, I'm actually coming from a different perspective. I work with people with disabilities.

Packet Pg. 346

1.F.1.b

12:43:51 And seeing some of the changes suggested
12:43:54 I think will be devastating.

12:44:01 I believe part of this discussion
12:44:04 is an effort to reduce costs
12:44:07 I think some of the most important thing, and I could be wrong, I might upset people on both sides.
12:44:12 But I think the most important thing for a lot of people
12:44:16 is their ability to go back and forth to work
12:44:20 That is very important for many of the people
12:44:24 And to me, for the average person.
12:44:27 They work five days a week. They travel to work and back from work.
12:44:33 every day
12:44:34 So that would be 10 rides.
12:44:38 a week or 40 rides a month
12:44:42 Why not?
12:44:44 adjust the allowable rides
12:44:47 from 60 down to 40
12:44:50 So these people could all be able, the average person would be able to travel to and from work every
day.
12:44:58 At a minimal cost.
12:45:01 And if you wanted to
12:45:04 use Access-a-Ride at your leisure.
12:45:07 then you would have to pay additional costs for it. But giving people 40 rides a month
12:45:11 That's a 30% cut in rides right there. That should be a significant saving for RTD, just making that cut
12:45:18 without any sort of special
12:45:21 changes. And then, again, at least people would be able to travel to and from work
12:45:27 every day. That may be the most important part of their
12:45:32 their schedule. That's just my thought. I thought it would be a simpler way to address the issue.
12:45:37 and hopefully minimize the impact on
12:45:40 people, especially those wanting to go to and from work every day.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:45:45 Thank you.
12:45:46 Thank you for your comments, Chuck.

12:46:02 Hi. Okay.
12:46:02 Hi, please share your comments.

12:46:10 comment. And I just wanted to say that with the payment
12:46:15 prior, that is hard for those with credit cards
12:46:19 Or those without
12:46:21 without enough on their credit cards. We have done this with neighborhood
12:46:26 vouchers and we have a hard time with like the $2 copay or it doesn't really matter how much it is. We
just had
12:46:33 a hard time with people paying with people paying
12:46:37 beforehand and they couldn't afford it or sometimes they had to have $50 on their card and at the end of
the month they didn't have $50 on their card.
12:46:47 And then I also wanted to recommend the email feedback, Uber-feedback at nagdo.org, N-A-G-D-U.
12:46:56 You can find information about the self ID pilot
12:47:01 for Uber about that. So that's hopefully that's helpful. Thanks, guys.
12:47:06 Thank you for taking the time, Sarah. We appreciate you.
12:47:13 All right, we've got a couple more hands raised. Up next, I see Judy.
12:47:28 Thank you.
12:47:28 Hi, Judy. Please share your comments.
12:47:32 Hi. Sure. Three comments.
12:47:36 First, I am just outside of the current service area.
12:47:41 That's a recent development.
12:47:43 I live in Boulder County.
12:47:46 And I moved here in 1989.
12:47:50 And I did that because there was a bus
12:47:52 a 205, which I used.
12:47:57 for 31 years.
12:47:59 And then you cut it.
12:48:02 So I am concerned with your current
12:48:06 proposed recommendations.
12:48:08 that I will not be able to use

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:46:04 Hi. I am going to represent Boulder County for this

12:48:11 the on-demand service at all.
12:48:14 And that's not by my design. That's by RTD's choice.

Packet Pg. 348

1.F.1.b

12:48:20 Second comment is that i seriously
12:48:24 agree with those

12:48:29 for people who work.
12:48:32 People with disabilities generally have a harder time finding work
12:48:38 And what you're doing here
12:48:40 is adding to that burden.
12:48:43 And that's not necessary.
12:48:46 and the
12:48:47 on-demand or the
12:48:49 Access-a-Ride service is very expensive.
12:48:53 provide the on-demand service.
12:48:55 as compared to the on-demand service.
12:48:58 And just for the math, people who work full time
12:49:02 The rides need to be 45 to 46.
12:49:05 Because there are more than four weeks in a month.
12:49:08 Finally, I do have a concern about the administrative cost.
12:49:13 that's going along with this program.
12:49:16 I see on this list of participants, six people from RTD.
12:49:22 Maybe you should look really hard at the staffing cost.
12:49:25 Thank you very much.
12:49:27 Thank you, Judy. We appreciate your feedback.
12:49:34 didn't end it soon enough. All right. Up next, we have uh
12:49:40 Carol. Hi, Carol.
12:49:50 Are you able to unmute Carol?
12:50:06 I'm here. Sorry.
12:50:07 Hi, Carol.

12:50:33 um and she
12:50:34 has a disability that is served through developmental pathways
12:50:40 And they had paid
12:50:42 For…
12:50:43 I'm going to say it wrong. The van.
12:50:47 access a ride. Right.
12:50:49 two trips a day. So that was $10 a day
12:50:53 So for folks with the CCBs.
12:50:56 if you could get the funding from developmental pathways to go
12:51:01 from the program they're not using to the program they are, that would give you
12:51:06 tons more money.
12:51:09 And…
12:51:11 I also wonder if there are some people out there who have money that would grant
12:51:18 extra money to this program
12:51:20 Because it is just so important to so many people in the area.
12:51:30 Awesome, Carol. Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback today.
12:51:34 Okay, thanks.
12:51:36 Thank you.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:50:29 are so invaluable.

12:52:17 The Access-on-Demand is
12:52:20 invaluable to me. I am legally blind.
12:52:23 And getting to and from work on time is

Packet Pg. 350

1.F.1.b

12:52:28 a very big personal goal of mine and just the way i
12:52:31 that I am.

12:52:37 time windows, it doesn't really work. So I know you're talking about
12:52:42 proposed changes, not simply cutting the Access-on-Demand
12:52:47 I hope you guys there can be a way found to keep it
12:52:51 As has been stated earlier by other people that they're not
12:52:54 the sense of independence and just pride and
12:52:58 feeling of self-worth by being able to
12:53:01 do those things on your own through Access-on-Demand is an incredible help.
12:53:06 Not only with getting to and from work, but I also live by myself with a 10-year-old son and
12:53:14 getting groceries simply from a mile and a half from the grocery store to the house is
12:53:20 a huge help versus walking
12:53:22 carrying heavy bags of groceries
12:53:25 from the grocery store to home so
12:53:30 I understand the i understand the
12:53:33 cutting the rides from 60, that doesn't make sense from a financial point of view because that is an
12:53:38 insanely expensive, as was stated earlier.
12:53:43 But I do think that we should try to find
12:53:49 maybe a more sustainable, cost-effective way to maintain Access-on-Demand because to
12:53:55 to me and people that are in my similar situation
12:53:59 It's invaluable.
12:54:02 That's a very important thing that I really hope
12:54:07 can await and be found to keep it sustainable.
12:54:11 And that's really all I have to say.
12:54:14 Thanks, Matt. That's why we're here today. We're trying to find a way to make sure this program sticks
around.
12:54:20 Appreciate the feedback.

12:54:25 iPhone. Okay.

12:54:38 Hi there.
12:54:40 Hello, can you hear me?

12:54:42 Yeah, please share your comments.
12:54:45 Okay. First of all.
12:54:48 I think maybe you could save a lot of money
12:54:53 I mean, only if the reduction of 60 trips
12:54:58 If maybe you take a survey or something of how many
12:55:03 How often people use
12:55:06 the service and based on that or use Access-on-Demand
12:55:10 And based on that, maybe because i mean even though not everyone uses the 60 trips, I'm sure there
are
12:55:18 quite a few people like myself. I don't always use 60 trips a month.
12:55:22 But that might cut costs also.
12:55:26 I'm just concerned about if you reduce the i mean
12:55:31 the Access-on-Demand to only the area where there were Access-a-Ride
12:55:36 uh goes um
12:55:38 I'm just, I don't understand why that would be more cost effective i guess because um
12:55:47 Like, for instance, I have a place that I go to that I can't take Access-a-Ride to
12:55:53 on the weekends because they don't go there but yet i can
12:55:56 with Access-on-Demand, I'm able to do that. So I just thank you. That's all I wanted to say.
12:56:03 Thank you for your comments today.
12:56:07 All right, seeing no other hands raised, let me pause the timer before it starts singing it.
12:56:13 To us again and I will move on again.
12:56:17 This is our second of three public meetings. So if you are interested in providing future public comment,
we will have another meeting on January 7th at noon virtually.
12:56:29 And as I mentioned before, on our website, rtd-denver.com
12:56:36 We have a feedback form where you can provide your input on
12:56:40 how the proposed changes will impact your use of Access-a-Ride and Access-on-Demand.

we make our programming stronger is through community collaboration and input.

Public Meeting
Paratransit Peer Review, December 2024 Update
January 7, 2024, 12:00pm
0:13 All right.
0:13 Good afternoon, everybody and happy New Year.
0:16 My name is Brandon Figliolino and I manage community engagement programming here at RTD and I'm
joined by my teammate Paul Hamilton, who is the Senior Manager of Paratransit Services.
0:27 Today we're going to give you a brief presentation on the proposed recommended changes for RT, DS,
accessor, Ride and Access on demand programs.
0:37 And following our presentation will be an open public comment period where you can speak to the proposed
changes and how they will impact you.
0:52 So Paul is going to briefly go over the current program for excess on demand and excess a ride and the
challenges.
1:00 We'll talk about the proposed changes, We'll get your feedback and then talk about next steps.
1:13 And I will pass it off to Paul.
1:17 Very good.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

12:57:09 we do have to make some changes to the program to make it sustainable, but we're trying to find middle

1.F.1.b

1:34 Yes, absolutely.
1:35 So we will be able to call you at the end of the presentation for up to two minutes of public comment.
1:45 For those who are interested in providing comments but don't want to verbalize them, there's also a Q&A
function in Zoom and also on our Access on Demand website, we have a form that you can also complete as well.
2:02 Thank you.
2:02 And with that, if you'll go to the next slide again, my name is Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager of Paratransit
Services.
2:11 I apologize, but the screen I'm looking at is not necessarily the screen that will have you seeing me all the
time, so I may be looking away.
2:18 RT DS paratransit program is currently comprised of the accessorized paratransit service and a supplemental
premium service commonly referred to as access on demand.
2:32 RT DS accessorized services are complimentary paratransit services that are conditionally provided to
passengers who travel within 3/4 of a mile of RT DS fixed route services or rail stations due to a disability or
mobility barrier as defined within the criteria set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
2:56 These services supplement regular fixed route services.
2:59 Customers are required to pay a fare associated with the trip taken and all RTD owned Accessoride vehicles
are branded and 100% accessible.
3:12 RT DS Access on Demand program is a supplemental premium service that provides curb to curb taxi and
rideshare options.
3:22 Access On Demand services are currently available 24724 hours a day, seven days a week throughout the
entire RTD service area and current Accessoride customers who have opted into one or more of the Access On
Demand program providers.
3:39 Access On Demand customers do not pay an initial upfront fare as they would for a regular Accessoride
services.
3:46 Instead, RTD pays for the 1st $25.00 of the customer's trip, with any cost above $25 paid by the customer.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

1:22 And Brandon, you may want to also indicate or remind folks because I see hands already up that there will be
absolutely time for folks to provide comments after the presentation.

3:56 Customers can take up to 60 trips per month on any one of the four different service providers they've
selected.

Packet Pg. 354

1.F.1.b

4:16 Recognizing this, it's important to point out that the Axis on Demand is meant to be supplemental and not a
replacement of the legally mandated paratransit service.
4:27 Accessor Ride.
4:28 Accessoride is available for scheduling routine and pre planned trips.
4:35 However, the trend of the last 24 months is unsustainable with access on demand increasing from $85,000
per month to over 1.2 million a month in this last 24 months of operation.
4:57 Some examples here of the kinds of things that access on demand was meant to do in terms of
complementing or supplementing existing paratransit services, including shopping or departure times can vary or
medical appointment times that can run early or in later than you had originally expected.
5:17 Obviously, there's any number of other unforeseen situations in which an on demand solution works as a
complement to the existing paratransit services program.
5:31 Next slide and now a summary of some of the proposed recommendations.
5:45 In the past seven plus months, a significant amount of information has been gathered and utilized to
formulate paratransit program modifications currently under consideration, which had been previously discussed
and are being summarized here.
6:00 They include the app to peer review that was completed and delivered to RTD in May of 2024, Transportation
cooperative research, program research, and other research that has provided findings of similar program services
across the nation.
6:19 Survey of 21 different transit agencies outlining similar program offerings that was conducted.
6:28 Of these 24, I'm sorry, 21 systems and two customer surveys that yielded 387 responses from a public survey
and 428 responses from a statistically sampled survey of existing access on demand customers.
6:46 Outcomes from feedback included two primary components which were in the importance of program
elements and trade off analysis and in both of those cases fair was deemed as most important to the customers
surveyed.
7:02 Additionally, there was an online customer feedback form, which so far and this is as of December of 2024,
yielded 561 comments.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

4:04 Next slide RTD is committed to ensuring that the Axis on Demand program remains fiscally and operationally
sustainable.

7:13 And then finally, there were three meetings in 2024, one in person, 2 virtual.

Packet Pg. 355

1.F.1.b

7:29 The data has been updated.
7:32 I'm sorry, I'm repeating myself.
7:33 I've got CHEAT SHEET notes and I'm going over them a little bit too fast.
7:39 Thank you.
7:39 Next slide, after considering feedback a customer and peer feedback, a regression analysis conducted on
customer survey data, customer program usage and other factors such as fiscal sustainability, staff have developed
a number of recommendations for consideration with regard to the Access on Demand program.
8:05 I'll go over the key recommendations under consideration shown on the screen and then I'll provide other
relevant data used to help develop these recommendations.
8:16 First, staff are recommending that customers pay a base fare equivalent to the fare paid on other accessorized
services.
8:26 This includes A450 base fare for customers or a reduced fare of 225 for live customers, which is again the
same as our current accessorized fare.
8:37 Staff are also recommending CAPS trip capping of 30 trips per month or a reduction from 60 to 30, and staff
are additionally recommending that the subsidy be increased from 25 to $30 per trip.
8:53 The recommendations are in alignment with the responses from customers regarding the order of importance
for program elements, with a reasonable fare being the most important element.
9:05 We're also recommending that the service area and service hours be modified to mirror those in the Access to
Ride program in effect at the time the changes are approved.
9:17 This does mean that service hours and area will change in alignment with the fixed route service changes that
occur three times over the course of the year.
9:27 And staff are also recommending a prerequisite that customers must be enrolled in and use accessorized
services for 90 days in alignment with average customer usage of accessorized services before becoming eligible to
use access on demand services as was recommended during the peer review.
9:49 Staff is also considering modifications to the suspension policy as well as ways to incentivize TNCS such as
Uber and Lyft to provide more wheelchair accessible vehicles.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

7:20 And we have additional meetings that will continue over the course of at least the next month, including this
meeting here.

10:04 Last slide or next slide, I'm sorry.

Packet Pg. 356

1.F.1.b

10:12 Utilizing survey information, customer and peer feedback, staff is also looking at a number of programmatic
changes or enhancements.
10:23 These include increasing the recertification.
10:27 For accessor ride from four years to five years and on time performance tracking that would be modified to
measure both pick up and drop off metrics.
10:37 RTD is also exploring software modifications and trip scheduling practices to support changes in service
provision which promote productivity enhancements.
10:49 There will also be modifications to the conditionally eligible, conditional eligible process which help support
qualifying trip conditions which differ in a region as large as the RTD region.
11:05 And finally, we are also exploring contract modifications as well as modifications to the existing suspension
policy.
11:13 We are working on developing a mixed fleet procurement plan to procure smaller vehicles such as sedans
and minivans.
11:24 And I think I am back to you, Brandon.
11:28 Yes, excellent.
11:29 Thank you so much.
11:30 So next steps, we're going to just talk about what the process is going to look like for the next coming weeks
as we work to finalize the other proposed recommendations before it goes to the Board.
11:45 So in November and December, we hosted some public meetings and provided an update to the Board of
Directors.
11:52 And now in January, we're continuing to meet with customers and stakeholders to gather their feedback.
11:59 And in February and March, we will be sharing this additional feedback with the Board of Directors and we'll
take policy recommendations to the Board for their adoption.

May 2025 service changes.

1.F.1.b

14:14 Again, if you have heard somebody say, oh, I like this part of the proposal and you agree, simply saying I

14:25 We do only have 45 minutes remaining and after that, the comment period will close.
14:31 So if you're not called to provide comment, you are welcome to complete that form online and we'll make
sure to drop that in the chat as well at rtd-denver.com.
14:42 All right, so I will kick off with XXX.
14:48 Hi, XXX, would you like to provide comment today?
14:53 Hi, yes, can you hear me?
14:55 Yes, go for it.
14:57 Awesome.
14:57 So my name is Greg.
14:59 First off, First off, thanks for having me on here.
15:03 And my couple of questions is, First off, on the rides that it's going to be possibly taken down to 30.
15:12 I'm just curious like statistically how many people chose that option?
15:18 And if so, like mathematically from 60 going to 30, that basically means people can't get to and from work
even five days a week with that access, simply because that would be 40 rides a month just getting to and from
work.
15:35 And then also asking kind of on behalf of some other friends was we heard in the notes from last time there
was something about like being within 3/4 of a mile of a bus stop.
15:50 Could you guys explain that?
15:54 So today we're just collecting feedback.
15:56 We aren't having a an answer, a dialogue just in the sake of time, but we have AQ and A on our website that
details what the three quarter of mile radius indicates.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

14:08 We want to hear from you and to ensure there is adequate time for public comment.

16:08 OK.

Packet Pg. 359

1.F.1.b

16:08 It just wasn't very clear and understandable, so that's why I was asking.

16:13 I'll answer this question.
16:15 But essentially the 3/4 of a mile is the service area that all of our buses will run.
16:21 So it access a ride the boundaries within three quarter miles of buses and trains and excess on demand
would follow that similar pattern and to ensure that it is serving the three quarter mile as opposed to anywhere in
the district.
16:38 OK.
16:38 So we just couldn't, so basically we couldn't get an Uber or Lyft if we're in within 3/4 of a mile of a bus stop,
it would need to be within the three quarter.
16:47 OK.
16:48 All right, cool.
16:49 Thank you.
16:49 Yeah, thank you, Greg.
16:54 All right, Next up we have Jay.
16:59 Can you hear me?
17:01 Yeah, go for it.
17:02 Sure.
17:03 So what Greg was saying before too.
17:05 I also would like to give a feedback that I the 30 ride will significantly make me again unemployed because
where I'm working is I'm working at the very one of the unsafe areas of Auto Rayan Denver, which is East Colfax.
17:22 And then I have been so I'm a visually impaired person.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

16:12 Yeah, absolutely.

17:24 So I've been robbed.

Packet Pg. 360

1.F.1.b

17:26 So because of that, I started living in a one of the like like somewhat safer area somewhere here in
Inglewood.
17:33 But you know, like if the rides will be reduced, either I have to get back to where which is like unsafe again,
right?
17:39 Or I won't be able to continue working.
17:42 So I request RTD to consider like, because it's like 50% reduction, right reduction.
17:48 You guys can do like 7080 something like that, like straight half reduction.
17:52 Like it is very, very, I feel like it's not fair because it's not just the work that we do, right?
18:01 Because once this access on demand program started, it made us more independent.
18:06 Like whether we wanted to go for shopping, we wanted to go for restaurants, go for a date, like any, any
normal thing that any other person would have done, right?
18:13 This, this allowed us to do it.
18:15 So yeah, instead of 30, you know, or, and another feedback I quickly want to give you guys.
18:21 I heard like, you know, it just jumped from 85,000 to 1.2 million.
18:26 I still see that Uber allows black to be used right.
18:30 And I think I have heard from my community, I've heard from my like, you know, from other folks as well.
18:35 So maybe we can save some money not been allowed like Uber Black to be used using under that like $25 or
whatever cap amount it is.
18:42 I think it'll save some money as well as please reconsider instead of 30, at least make it like 4045 or so.
18:49 So that how Greg said like we all can at least go to work and support not only ourselves but our family too.
18:55 I think that's all I have.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

17:25 I have been bleed there.

18:57 Awesome.

18:58 Jay, thank you for your comments today.

19:05 OK.
19:06 Can you can you all hear me?
19:07 Yeah.
19:07 Hi, Courtney.
19:08 Please share your name is Guy.
19:09 Thanks.
19:10 My name is Courtney Tripp.
19:11 And I work for Atlantis.
19:13 And so echo what Jay and Greg said.
19:17 Yeah.
19:18 Like to reduce it down to 30, we wouldn't be able to get to work.
19:22 And, you know, I'm sure other people on this call can relate, you know, access a ride, you know, it's a 30
minute window and it's kind of at the end of the day, we just want to get home like everyone else does.
19:36 You know, how someone can just jump in their car and be home.
19:39 You know, sometimes we have to wait 30 minutes and then be on the access a ride for an hour and a half.
19:44 You know, with this Uber and Lyft, with the access to the man, it gives us that freedom everyone else has to
be able to get home to our families.
19:52 Clipped in her will not be home at seven 8:00 at night.
19:56 You know, I have a kid, I have a 12 year old little boy and, you know, two dogs and my husband and, you
know, I this is an, this is an independence thing for me.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

19:00 Next up, we have Courtney.

20:11 And to reduce it down to 30, I mean, that's like half.

Packet Pg. 362

1.F.1.b

20:17 I mean, like, you know, Greg or you know, Jay said like.

20:29 It would be reasonable.
20:31 That's all I have.
20:34 Awesome.
20:34 Thank you for your comments, Courtney.
20:37 Next up we have Tamasha.
20:43 Hello, can you hear me?
20:45 Yeah, please share your comments.
20:47 Hello.
20:48 I'm a former employee of Accessorize.
20:51 So I know how it works for both Accessorize and Access on demand with getting people to and from where
they need to go.
20:59 I think that this these proposals are, are really going to affect a lot of people.
21:05 And I can say it's affected me as well because like when I take an, an Accessorize to a doctor's appointment
there, there's been a few times where is I've had to get off of accessorie and order a lift because they could not get
me to my appointments on time, my appointments on time.
21:27 And that has been an inconvenience for me because dispatch keeps scheduling people, the driver to pick up
other people.
21:35 And I had one driver to say, listen, there's no way I can get you to your appointment.
21:40 So he stopped at a secure place, let me off and I was able to get a lift, which was free and to my
appointment because it was way out of at the tech center.
21:56 And I think that with, with that being said, along with the fact that the fair is there's going to be a fair that's
going to affect a lot of people because believe it or not, some people just don't have $4.50 or $2.25.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

20:22 45 or you know, 50 I feel like would be, you know, good.

22:14 As far as the rides are concerned, last month for the month of December, I used 59 rides.

Packet Pg. 363

1.F.1.b

22:30 But to reduce it, I mean I would propose that it be reduced to like 45.
22:37 That will allow people to get to and from work and maybe have a few rides to get to the grocery store or
maybe last minute medical.
22:48 That's all I have.
22:49 Thank you.
22:52 Awesome Tamasha.
22:52 Thank you for your time.
22:54 Next up, we have Carmine.
22:57 Oh, Carmine, you're muted still one SEC.
23:13 OK, You can hear me now, right?
23:15 Yeah.
23:16 Go for it, Carmine.
23:17 OK.
23:18 I would like to reiterate the previous comments because I think that when people work 30 is too few because
that's only 15 back and forths and there's 22 days of work on a normal month 2321.
23:39 And so they need the 45 S instead of cutting it down 50%, if you cut it down 25%, which would make it to
45, I think that's a good, good halfway meeting point.
23:55 And so the people that want to get to work can get to work and maybe the grocery store and a movie or
whatever.
24:01 So I agree with all those comments.
24:04 I also would like to say that I was one of the biggest gripers with access on demand because you didn't have
access for bus for wheelchair people and my wheelchair is not folding.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

22:21 I generally use all my rides and I always save at least one just in case if the system says I went over or
something.

24:23 So in the last couple of months we've sent the buses out on Uber.

Packet Pg. 364

1.F.1.b

24:29 And so I have not had any problems.

24:39 And I try not to go over my limit of rides.
24:42 I don't go over my limit of rides.
24:44 And so thank you very much who's ever responsible.
24:49 Thank you.
24:50 Thank you, Carmine.
24:51 We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback.
24:55 Next up, we have Francie.
24:59 Hi, thanks for taking the time to let me speak.
25:03 I just had three quick points or things for consideration.
25:07 My first is this new fare system for access on demand.
25:11 Currently the subsidy does not cover tips.
25:14 So it's not like we're getting the rights for free.
25:16 We're paying for tips O you're saying that 450 is going to be equal to a bus ride.
25:21 However, when you add on a tip both ways, you're making this more expensive than the access ride buses.
25:28 The second thing is I hear a lot of plans about making plans about making plans for future changes, but
you're cutting service by but before you can provide equal services on accessory.
25:38 And I think that's premature and going to cause a lot of backlash.
25:42 The buses already have a problem being on time and by trying to move people back to buses or cut excess
on demand, you're going to have a lot of customers that aren't going to be able to get where they go.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

24:33 I'd like to commend whoever needs to be commended on that and I really appreciate it.

25:54 And I think I agree with everybody talking about not enough rights for work.

Packet Pg. 365

1.F.1.b

26:03 And the third thing is I don't think the math is mathing for me.
26:07 Lots of my rides, and I know other people that use access on demand as well.
26:12 Our rights aren't over $25.00.
26:14 So if you're getting that, if you're not using the full 25 and it's actually less than that, I think you should
explore moving this 25 to 30.
26:24 It doesn't make sense that you're going to try and pay $5 more than what you're paying when some of the
rights aren't even 25.
26:32 It just the math doesn't make sense and I wish it was explained better.
26:37 That's it.
26:39 Thank you for your comments, Francie.
26:43 Next up, we have Karen.
26:49 Hello.
26:49 Hi, Karen.
26:50 Hi there.
26:51 Thanks for doing this.
26:53 I am in a wheelchair, I'm paralyzed from the waist down.
26:58 I have incontinence issues.
27:02 I found that using Access A Ride was extremely difficult for me because I was not able to get to my
appointments without soiling myself.
27:19 So I'm being a little graphic, but I think you need to consider this and thank you for doing so.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

25:57 I think the second point that is if you're late for work several times because of a bus, you're going to get
fired and lose your job.

27:25 With Access A Ride, I would sometimes be in my wheelchair on the bus for over 2 hours for a trip that with
Access On Demand is now taking only 20 minutes.

Packet Pg. 366

1.F.1.b

27:37 And so I'm maintaining my dignity, as I care to choose to call it by using Access on Demand.

27:50 I only use access on demand for my PT, my adaptability exercises and medical appointments.
27:59 The other thing that was a little unclear, it said that you'd said in the presentation earlier that and, and this,
this needs to be clarified, that the only way that you could use Access on demand was if you were also using
Access a ride.
28:20 So I needed some clarity on that.
28:24 Circling back to what I said about my incontinence issues, my using Access a ride doesn't really work for me
and it doesn't work for the riders either.
28:34 It's it's not a good situation.
28:37 So I needed clarity on the excess a ride and the on demand if, if that question makes sense or if that I don't
know if that makes sense.
28:48 Hopefully it does.
28:53 Awesome, Karen.
28:53 Thank you so much for your time and we'll make sure to include the your questions for consideration.
29:00 Next up we have Louise.
29:06 Yes, my name is Louise Apodaca.
29:10 I'm a very long time Accessoride user.
29:14 My questions include is the taxi service power wheelchair accessible?
29:21 And the second thing is what is the actual service area?
29:25 I am centrally located just about like downtown area of Denver.
29:32 I have a stage 3 kidney disease and my care for the kidney disease is that hand shoots, is that in my service
area?

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

27:47 So I think those things are considered, should be considered.

29:46 Excuse me, I'm sorry.

Packet Pg. 367

1.F.1.b

29:50 And the the taxi service, is it at this time power wheelchair accessible?

29:57 Those are my questions.
30:00 Thank you, Louise.
30:01 Your questions have been noted and we'll be sure to address them as we move forward with the process.
30:06 Thank you.
30:08 Next up, we have Shane.
30:17 Yes, hello.
30:18 Hi, Shane.
30:20 Hello.
30:20 Thank you guys for putting on this meeting.
30:24 Kind of like what everybody else says.
30:25 But beside that, you know if you guys are going to just drop it down to 30 and everything, you guys are
taken away.
30:34 You know, instead of creating, breaking down barriers, you guys are now recreating new barriers and you
guys are going to be taken away from everybody's independence on what they can and can't do.
30:48 And you know, that's just not humanly right.
30:52 You know, I don't know what you guys are doing on working with politicians to keep it the way that it is or
charge even the minimal fee.
31:04 But also the same thing on like you guys said, you know, you guys are going to try to keep it like like the
accessoride thing.
31:13 And in past, people that are in wheelchairs have said that they can't go out on a Saturday night because
access on the accessoride only goes to a certain time.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

29:56 Thank you.

31:25 So you guys are also creating more barriers there for anybody that's in a wheelchair.

32:26 Right.
32:26 There might be some technical difficulties with Allison.
32:29 So Allison will come back to you.
32:31 Next up we've got Diane.
32:34 Oh, hi Allison, can you hear me?
32:37 Yes, can you hear me?
32:38 Yes, please go ahead and provide your for the opportunity.
32:41 I'll be brief.
32:42 I just recently got assessor ride and I'm very grateful for the on demand.
32:49 My comment is just that I'm sorry that there seems to be having to cut either the number of rides or add to
the price for the rider.
33:01 I would come down with trying to have less rides because the $9 round trip plus tips is is a hardship for
seniors or people that are are are low income or not working.
33:16 So that's just my comment and thank you for doing this.
33:20 Thank you.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

31:31 And then also just like the last lady, anybody that has severe medical problems, you know, at the end of the
day, it's just causing barriers.

33:21 Awesome.
33:22 Thank you, Allison.

Packet Pg. 369

1.F.1.b

33:23 And sorry, Diane, please share your comments.

33:32 Is that working now?
33:33 Yeah, go for it.
33:34 Thanks so much.
33:35 So I have sort of a few things like I've been agreeing with everyone, everything that everyone's been saying.
33:45 I'm a little confused about the service area because when I signed up for Accessoride I am a mile away from
any bus stop.
34:00 Like I'm right in the middle of my neighborhood.
34:02 There is no option other than access or access on demand.
34:08 So you're saying I can't do anything like is how I am looking at that or how I'm understanding it.
34:18 And it just seems that like it's that seems counterintuitive And also the increasing of how much you guys are
willing to pay per ride, but then cutting down how many rides we're all allowed to have is demoralizing.
34:38 And it feels like you guys are taking out your financial issues on those of us who cannot afford it.
34:44 And so that's sort of my like my little vent, but I feel it's as it's been said before, it's taking away our
opportunities to be acting participants in our society.
35:00 We are have issues with driving.
35:03 We need, we need this to get around and be like either go to doctor's appointments, go to classes, go to
work and it just feels like you guys can't get your money from other places.
35:18 So those of us who are on fixed incomes are where it's being decided.
35:24 That's it.
35:25 Thank you guys for putting us all on.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

33:31 OK.

35:27 Yeah, thank you, Diane.

Packet Pg. 370

1.F.1.b

35:38 We know that that's a that's a reoccurring theme today.
35:41 So we'll make sure that that's addressed.
35:44 Next up, we have a phone number ending in 9710.
35:48 Would you like to share your comments?
35:52 This is Keisha and I agree with everything that's been said.
36:00 A couple things that I'm a little concerned about what the advantage is.
36:06 I'm not sure what the advantage is to access on demand if you're going to reduce it to a service, the service
area.
36:16 Because currently when I use excess on demand, it gives me more of an opportunity than using accessoride
when I go to specifically a certain place, particularly on Saturdays, Sundays when I'm not able to use accessorize,
but I can use access on demand now and I'm able to do that.
36:38 If that were taken away, then I wouldn't be able to such attend the piano recitals such like that.
36:45 And my second concern is that using Accessorize the access on demand for the people that you're saying
that within a 90 day.
36:58 Don't use.
37:00 I'm, I'm sorry, I, I was a little confused about that.
37:03 If that could be clarified because some people, you know, don't, don't use it that often, but they still need it.
37:10 They still need the service.
37:11 I'm speaking on behalf of someone else who's not online at this time.
37:15 So thank you.
37:18 Thank you for your comments, Keisha.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

35:28 We appreciate your comments and we'll be sure that when as the project progresses that were very clear in
identifying service areas and things like that.

37:21 Next up we have Earl.

Packet Pg. 371

1.F.1.b

37:25 Thank you.

37:28 Hi, Yeah, I have a couple of couple of comments.
37:32 I, I can understand everybody's concern regarding the reduction in the number of allowable rides.
37:39 I personally don't use access on demand enough to hit that ceiling.
37:45 So it's not a big issue.
37:47 I do think it's fair to add a, a base rate, the 450.
37:53 I think that's fair with access on demand.
37:58 So I'm I'm kind of at odds with everybody else on, on that portion of it.
38:04 What I am concerned about is you talk about providing some incentive for the the the Lyfts and the Ubers to
provide wave vehicles.
38:20 I think that if they are going to be paratransit providers, it should be written into the contract or should have
been written into the contract originally and should be written any future contracts that to be a paratransit
provider, they need to have a wheelchair accessible vehicles in their fleets or available.
38:42 Secondly, I've heard horror stories about the the taxi providers, the Ubers and the Lyfts coming up on a call,
accepting a call and when they see someone with a animal, you know, a dog or people with a wheelchair, they will
cancel the call and drive on by them.
39:13 So that is something that I think needs to be addressed with with those people as well.
39:18 And I also don't like the access on demand being limited to the same service areas as as the excessive ride.
39:32 So thank you.
39:50 Oh, sorry, I was muted.
39:52 Next up we have Catrice.
40:00 Can you hear me?

40:04 Go for it, Catrice.

40:06 I want to also thank you for having the meeting as a recipient of the on demand program.
40:12 And also I've said on the board working with RTD and some of the meetings, if you can clarify, I know this is
not a answer question, Q&A question, but I do need clarity.
40:23 And if you can do it at the end of the meeting clarify.
40:27 I understood that the the on demand program save it save RTD more money than doing the accessor ride
with one pick up.
40:35 So that was one question and two at the end.
40:37 If you, I'm not sure if you could clarify the mileage.
40:39 I don't know if I heard .35 or if I heard one mile.
40:43 If you guys can clarify that at the end.
40:46 Oh, so my comments are me also using the the on demand program.
40:50 As it's already been said, it helps me to be independent and not just for myself, but for the clients I work
with at Atlantis getting to work, getting to their doctor's appointments and, and things like that.
41:02 That may not be in the service area of the access a ride.
41:06 I'm hoping you all can consider that.
41:08 But also to be fair, I'd like to know, I, I do understand that the budget is an issue.
41:13 I understand that.
41:14 And I'm wondering if there's other things and you guys have talked about like maybe grants, I mean
donations.
41:21 Is there anything else can be done to kind of offset these expenses?

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

40:05 Hi, thank you.

41:26 And, and I understand something does need to be done, but I'm wondering if you guys can rethink it and
see if we can go to the 40 trips, maybe keeping the, the amount, the 4:50, I don't know, but just seeing all the
options before charging this kind of money that can add up.

Packet Pg. 373

1.F.1.b

41:44 It's, it's not as much of a problem for me, but some of the clients I work with are on a very fixed income.

41:52 I just want to see that it could be a little more robust like it's been with also keeping in mind the budget has
been an issue as well.
42:00 So I'm wondering how we can balance that up and and come to a medium here with with everyone's needs.
42:06 Thank you.
42:08 Thank you, Katrice.
42:09 We appreciate your comments today.
42:11 Next up, we have Anna.
42:16 Hi, can you hear me?
42:18 Yeah, Please share your comments.
42:20 Hi, My comment is I have my daughter who has disabilities and who works and has to leave the house at
5:30 in the morning.
42:29 So when this program came on board, it was a godsend because she's able to work.
42:36 You know, I have used Accessoride for my client since 2005 and believe me, I maybe the the people on the
board need to sit and wait for the bus when they're ready to go and then the bus doesn't show up and then you
have to cancel and then you get a phone call.
43:04 So I'm saying that next time you're going to be penalized and with no fault of their own.
43:11 They already pay for a class and they're not there because assessor, I was late and you call the dispatch and
they said, but they were there and it and it's not true.
43:25 And so I don't know if these people actually need to sit with the clients so that they know what we're talking
about because it is unfair.
43:35 I can drive my clients if they're late or something, I'll do whatever I need to do, but some people can't.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

41:49 And so I'm really grateful for the program.

43:43 So there's got to be another way.

Packet Pg. 374

1.F.1.b

43:56 That's just my opinion.
43:58 Thank you.
44:00 Thank you for your comments saying that.
44:01 We appreciate it.
44:03 Next up, we have Jordan.
44:09 Hi, good afternoon, Jordan.
44:11 Hi, So my, my comment is going to be pretty bold.
44:17 Why not move more resources to the program that's actually working for people?
44:25 The other comment and that would be as as my partner is telling me access right on demand.
44:32 Why not move more resources to the program that's actually working for people and build that up rather
than taking it away?
44:41 The other part of it, So ride drivers are so overworked and upset and it makes us upset.
44:51 And generally the access on demand drivers are a lot friendlier and a lot more personable, probably because
they don't have a the same kind of workload being shuffled all over the city like they are.
45:05 So just putting that on the record as well.
45:10 So, and I've been agreeing with a lot of other people on this call, that's just our two cents is why not just
take more resources and put it towards the thing that's actually working for people and making us independent
instead of taking it away?
45:26 Thank you.
45:28 Thank you, Jordan.
45:28 We appreciate your comment today.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

43:47 There's has to be another way because this is unfair for the people that cannot or don't have someone to
take them.

45:32 Recognizing we have about 14 minutes left and looks like 10 people want to speak.

Packet Pg. 375

1.F.1.b

45:37 So Next up we have Charisse.

45:47 Number one, I was very much proud of you guys when you initially set up the Access on demand.
45:54 It is by far the most independent I have felt as a blind person in being able to get from point A to point B.
46:01 I'm very disconcerted about the plans that you are making on backtracking on that now.
46:06 It kind of makes me feel like you've dangled a carrot and now you're like, Nope, actually, we're not going to
give that to you.
46:11 And it's taking away a lot of my independence.
46:15 In a lot of ways.
46:15 There's a reason why accessoride has not worked well for people.
46:19 We know that time is a big part of that.
46:22 And very much by saying that accessoride needs to be the primary one makes us feel like second race
citizens just because we have a disability.
46:30 It makes it seem like we are expected to have huge amounts of time to just sit around and wait instead of
actually just being normal members of society that have things to do.
46:40 Just like someone who is able bodied.
46:42 So I'm very much not OK with the idea that we're taking this away.
46:47 I choose for a reason not to use accessoride.
46:49 I have been stranded before a building is opened in a Blizzard waiting for an appointment by Accessoride
because they dropped me off 1/2 an hour early and at since then I have chosen not to use Access Ride.
47:02 I don't have to worry about that with Access on demand because I don't have to wait so long to get a ride
and I know when I'm going to be dropped off, so I'd like to keep that in perspective.
47:14 I'd also like to keep in mind that you say it's within a certain service area, but your service areas are always
changing.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

45:45 So I have a couple of comments.

Packet Pg. 376

1.F.1.b

47:26 So maybe you can think about expanding where we can go with Accessoride and excess on demand so that
if a county as a county as a whole is paying taxes to RTD, that whole county gets service from Accessoride and
Access on demand.
47:41 Thank you.
47:45 Thank you for the comments.
47:47 Next up, we have iPads, so if you can share your name before you speak, that'd be great.
47:55 Yes.
47:55 Hello.
47:55 Can you hear me?
47:56 Yeah.
47:57 Hi there.
47:58 Hi.
47:58 My name is Oscar.
47:59 I am, I am visually impaired.
48:02 I am legally blind.
48:03 And I just want to comment that when Access on demand came on board, it really has made me very
independent because I am a independent contractor that actually have to go from one place to another place as a,
as a, I work as a Spanish English interpreter for the medical field.
48:27 So if it's reduced, it will, it will affect the, the way that I, I bring income into my house for my family and my
kids.
48:41 One of the comments perhaps if instead of putting up to $30.00 and reducing it to to 30 rides, why not $20
and leave it to 50 or 60 rides?

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

47:20 You take routes away, which changes the service area, and then we can't get to where we need to go
anyway.

48:57 I mean, I don't, I don't there's a sometimes I take the axis, a ride axis on the man up to four to five times a
day.

Packet Pg. 377

1.F.1.b

49:17 And it and I don't sometimes I have to pay the extra amount and it's OK.
49:24 But if if it reduces to 30, it it will for me it will put me it, it will, it's not going to make me whole.
49:35 So that's that's my comment.
49:39 I mean, and and another thing, if I still have time, instead of subsidizing those companies, why not have
better provide training for them to be able to recognize a white cane and also not to live a stranded the OK.
50:04 I ran out of time.
50:06 You're good.
50:06 Oscar, thank you so much for your comments.
50:08 We appreciate you.
50:10 Next up, we have Julianne.
50:15 You hear me?
50:16 Yeah.
50:17 Hi.
50:17 Please share your comments.
50:19 Several things.
50:21 I agree with what they're saying.
50:23 I think it's called access on demand.
50:26 I take them and changing the accessorite itself.
50:34 I can't afford it and I I can't walk.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

49:09 And I have sometimes up an hour to get from one location to another location, one hospital to another

50:39 I'm on a Walker.

Packet Pg. 378

1.F.1.b

50:40 I can't walk very far with access on demand.

50:50 My doctor wants me to exercise so I need to go to the Wheat Ridge Rec Center and I can't get out there
without the the access for demand and the 60 rides are pretty nice for doing that.
51:14 I used to drive for Accessoride myself three years ago and they're right.
51:19 We we can't get to them on time and some people are late to their appointments and access for demand.
51:30 I take Lyft is a much better service.
51:34 OK.
51:37 Thank you for your comments today.
51:39 Next up we have Danielle.
51:44 Yes, can you hear me?
51:46 Yeah.
51:46 Hi, Danielle.
51:47 Hi.
51:48 So please, I agree with majority of the folks that are speaking, including the one that spoke about putting
money and funding and resources towards access on demand, seeing that it works really well.
52:01 As a single mother, the 60 rides are already limiting for me and the ability to do things.
52:07 I cannot take access a ride and I cannot use public transportation as I cannot use public transportation and
access a ride is very limiting.
52:16 Which is why it also felt like a godsend to have access on demand, to be independent and live.
52:22 It's one of the reasons why I'm still in Colorado because it's a a program that is not in many States and every
state I look at, I make sure is there a similar program like this.

Attachment: Public Meetings Transcripts (5080 : Paratransit Peer Review and Recommended Program Modifications)

50:47 I get to where I'm going on time.

52:32 So it feels very successful to keep in Colorado.

Packet Pg. 379

1.F.1.b

52:36 And I think that if if we're reducing it, it's already with it's already limitation.

52:44 You only have to use one step per one step per ride.
52:47 So it's already to be restrictive.
52:49 I've gone over my 60 rights multiple months and have to pay, you know, out of pocket for when I run out to
to thought of reducing it seems humiliating and demoralizing for for me and I just want you to take into
consideration as a single mother with with with children, they cannot also use access a ride.
53:14 So it then it leaves us in a very big pickle and financing in depth.
53:23 Thank you.
53:37 We have Linda up next.
53:42 Hi, my name is Linda Brown.
53:44 I have a daughter who has Down syndrome and she's 32 years old, born and raised in Colorado, and excess
on demand has changed her life, not only her life, but my life.
53:56 She was not able to manage accessoride.
53:59 She couldn't work that she couldn't do the phone, the waiting, all of it.
54:03 She did not have the cognitive ability to handle that by herself.
54:07 But she has been able to handle access on demand no problem.
54:12 And it's changed her life for the better.
54:14 It's it's an equity issue, folks.
54:17 And please, I agree so much, put the money with what's working.
54:21 And I think you're getting a really overwhelming message here that excess on demand works.

54:39 This is Ellie and a professional working with people who are blind and low vision and deaf blind here in
Colorado.
54:51 I'm a native working with a lot of natives, but I wanted to point out that Colorado has been voted number
one state in the nation for places to live for people with disabilities.
55:01 And this is largely a part of the access on demand program.
55:04 So the people who are living here prior to the start of this program, like someone said earlier, they were
feeling like second class citizens that they had to wait.
55:12 They had to spend extra time and money to get the same equity of transportation that our sighted and able
bodied folks do here.
55:23 We have so many amazing opportunities for adaptive recreation.
55:26 We've got schools and programs that support people with disabilities and people are choosing to live here
because of them.
55:34 And RTD has been winner years and years, award-winning services and people are here, they're moving
here, they're coming here.
55:42 Other states are looking to us for leadership.
55:44 And I really hope we can find a solution with our government and folks who value the contributions that
people with disabilities make to our state.

57:15 I would love it if Lyft had this thing where you could, you know, you can add more.
57:23 No, they wanted to talk, but more free, more free services like with Lyft instead of charging for every single
thing.

not have to worry about, you know, not being able to afford that, you know, and I would love it if RTD could, if
RTD could, you know, add more funds and money to, to the whole thing, you know, so that people who, who are

Understanding the need for sustainability, I believe the proposed changes will drastically affect participation in the
AoD program and have a significant impact on participants' lives. Perhaps a different approach to managing the
AoD program would facilitate the end goal of sustainability. Rather than monitoring the number of rides and
implementing a cost cap on each, has RTD looked into allocating a fixed monthly dollar amount to each
participant? Once the dollar amount is exhausted within the month, the participant simply must wait until the
following month for their next allocation If there are unused funds at the end of the month, they recycle back into
the Aod program (not roll over or accumulate in the participant's account). It seems this approach would be much
more sustainable, easier to budget for and manage, track, plan for and require less system programming and
maintenance. In lieu of a simplified program management, I question the long term sustainability with the changes
proposed. I believe I heard during one of the public meetings that the average AoD fare is ~$16 to $18, although
most of my fares are lower. It seems counterintuitive to increase the subsidy to $30 while having the participant
pay for the first $4.50 when the average fare is substantially less. Wouldn't leaving the subsidy at $25 (without the
$4.50 payment) accomplish the same thing? Maxing out the proposed changes ($30 x 30 rides = $900 per
participant). Assuming a change in the program as outlined above were considered viable, a substantially lower
per participant allocation would provide cost savings, allow participants to manage their own trips with no 'out of
pocket' expenses and feasibly pull money back into budget for future use. (example: $450 allocation @ $16 per
trip = 28 trips per month)
The current proposed changes will have a negative impact on the lives of many of the participants, some of which
rely on the AoD program for commuting to work. Of concern is also imposing the Access a Ride boundary
limitation to the Access on Demand program. With more medical offices moving out of the Denver to surrounding
areas (Littleton, Lakewood, etc.)this limitation could affect a participants ability to medical care.
I ask that you heavily weigh the value of the AoD program against the negative effects the proposed changes may
have (isolation, health, the freedom afforded to those that can't drive). Long term financial sustainability is
understood, but perhaps making some rudimentary changes to the manner in which the program is managed
rather than implementing drastic changes could provide the sustainability desired. Please consider the above
changes suggested as a catalyst for departmental discussion and brain storming.
thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback.

30 trips a month is not enough, maybe 45 trips a month.
My son uses uber daily to go to work. However we live more than a mile from the bus stop. This sounds like it
would limit his ability to use Uber. That would be devastating for him and his independence. In addition, he is
looking at moving to the Grove in Broomfield which is also more than a mile from a bus stop. Please reinstate the
no limits to access on demand services

Changing the boundaries for Access-on-Demand will have a significant negative impact on my ablility to get to
where I need to go and where I can work and decreasing the number of trips per month could leave me stranded.
It will have a negative impact on where I can live and also have a negative impact on my meager income. It will
have a negative impact on my time as it takes so long for Access-a-Ride transportation with the wait windows and
how long trips take where there are multiple stops. Being disabled is hard enough, these proposed changes will
make it even harder! I respectfully request NO changes be made to the current benefit that has been life
changing.

As a professional serving adults with intellectual/developmental disabilities. It is critical that this very low-income
population maintains access to transportation as it is their greater barrier to community integration due to not
being a driving population. Understanding where this population lives, such as the future development called The
Grove at Cottonwood, located at 1355, 1374, and 1394 Cottonwood Street in Broomfield, is critical to ensure they
are in the Access-a-Ride service area. Expanding Access-a-Ride access to neuro-inclusive housing locations
and/or affordable housing developments that include people with disabilities. This would ensure residents retain
access to both the Access-a-Ride and Access-on-Demand programs, which are heavily relied on for
transportation to shopping, events, work, etc. We appreciate your support in fostering equitable and accessible
transit options for this vital community.
I respectfully request that RTD consider including the future development called The Grove at Cottonwood,
located at 1355, 1374, and 1394 Cottonwood Street in Broomfield, in the Access-a-Ride service area. This 40-unit
development, breaking ground this year, will serve adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities who
could greatly benefit from RTD services. Expanding Access-a-Ride access to this location would ensure residents
retain access to both the Access-a-Ride and Access-on-Demand programs, which are heavily relied on for
transportation to shopping, events, work, etc. We appreciate your support in fostering equitable and accessible

I also have access to Metro Taxi through the CIH waiver. While I appreciate the availability of this service, I have
some concerns about the cleanliness and modernity of the vehicles and safety of the passengers like myself who
do not need a wheelchair lift.

I prefer using Uber when possible and hope that this option will remain available.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

The City and County of Broomfield is undergoing a transit study to help improve transit access for people of all
ages, abilities and incomes. As part of the study effort, we held a focus group with service providers and
advocates that work with individuals with disabilities. In the focus groups we heard about the challenges faced by
this community, specifically related to the time-consuming trips and coverage gaps of Access-a-Ride in
Broomfield. The Access-on-Demand program was highly regarded as a way to circumvent the gaps in Access-aRide coverage in Broomfield and allow people more independence and freedom. Currently, there are 71 daily
Access-a-Ride boardings in Broomfield. We don’t have data for Access-on-Demand, but the number of daily
boardings for this service is likely higher. This indicates a high demand for service for individuals with disabilities
in Broomfield, despite the fact that much of Broomfield is not within the Access-a-Ride service area. The proposed
changes to the Access-on-Demand program will have a significant impact on this community in Broomfield and
will negatively impact their quality of life.
Broomfield encourages RTD to consider allowing a deviation from the ¾-mile fixed-route service area boundary in
order to serve the future Grove at Cottonwood development at 14th Avenue and Cottonwood Street in Broomfield,
which will break ground this year. The project will be constructed and managed by the Broomfield Housing
Alliance (BHA) to provide housing priority for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and lies
only a few hundred feet outside of the ADA paratransit service area. While there will be a van onsite for group
trips, many of the future residents work and need consistent transportation options. Access-a-Ride and Accesson-Demand service is critical to these future residents.
Additionally, Broomfield staff has the following feedback regarding the other proposed changes:
Reducing the total number of trips by half seems like a drastic change. This would effectively only allow for 15
round trips per month. Please consider a more conservative reduction.
Adding a $4.50 fare to each trip while also increasing the subsidy from $25 to $30 dollars per trip is confusing. It
seems that most trips would still be zero cost to the customer, so increasing the subsidy while adding a fare would
only add complexity. We urge RTD to reconsider this fare structure to retain simplicity and not implement costbarriers to transportation.
Aligning the Access-on-Demand service hours with fixed route schedules similarly overcomplicates the service.
The fixed-route schedules are variable based on time of day, day of week and location within the district. Aligning
with these schedules would make it more difficult for customers to plan trips. This change would also decrease
the likelihood that the Access-on-Demand could be used in an emergency situation when someone has missed
the last bus or train and has no other way to get home. Please consider implementing consistent hours of
operation for the service or, preferably, retaining the 24/7 availability.
Thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to provide input.
Sincerely,
The City and County of Broomfield

Access on Demand is much much easier for our 2 DD young adult daughters than Access A Ride, which they
could not do on their own. We recommend putting AAR(which is almost impossible to use without setting aside an
entire day) money into AAD (which is much more user friendly and convenient and would not cost RTD nearly as
much as AAR buses, drivers, maintenance, insurance, etc.) That makes so much more sense economically for
RTD and for the users!

I find the Access-on-Demand program to be very liberating. I would propose reducing the number of rides to
around 45 or 40 like Boston. Another idea is to charge more for rides 31-45. Thank you!
Elderly & disabled population continues to increase in our area! The greater the availability, ease of access, and
extending services, etc...will increase ridership immeasurably
Those changes will make it more difficult for both of my daughters with intellectual disabilities to be as
independent as the current system which has been so beneficial for them.
I have two persons who use these services, one access a ride only the other access on demand only. The
changes above mentioned will truly impact their lives and mine. Not sure if the people who came out the idea of
the changes have ever sit on a blizzard waiting for access a ride after the building has close and they are running
late. Or wait an hour for the bus when access on demand is there in 5 minutes. Now why charge the $4.50 most
people give $5.00 tip per trip?
I am 77 yrs now and I am very pleased to use everyday bus and Access a Ride and $25/-coupons.
Thanks you RTD
The 3/4 mile boundary constraint moved my sister from Access-a-Ride - which she had been using for several
years via a grandfathered-in neighborhood address and despite continual service issues - to Access-on-Demand
when Access-a-Ride dropped her route with no explanation. She uses AoD maybe 8 times a month, so hardly
abusive of the privilege. If RTD implements the 3/4 mile boundary for Access-on-Demand rides, she will be SOL
for any RTD accessible services. This seems a grave disservice in a major city like Denver. Are we going
backwards or forwards in our support of the physically and cognitively challenged community?
Limit service hours to reflect current fixed-route service hours.
This is problematic because it rules out the need for emergency rides. I have use it to get to/from emergency
rooms. I sometimes have to go to Erie and the current bus service is only twice a day so this item would rule out
my trips to my doctor there.
The reason I need assistance with getting to and from places is because I have MS and cannot drive far
distances. This is a problem with getting to and from doctors appointments, jobs or classes that are spread all
around the Denver Metro area. When I applied for Access-a-Ride, I was told my only option was Access-onDemand because of my distance from public transportation. With these suggested changes, I will now have to
pay to get to and from appointments, classes and work. I am on disability so have a fixed income & this feels
more like a punishment than a viable solution to RTD's financial problems. You are focusing on the wrong group
and the wrong problems. The general public should be charged more than the disabled community is, unlike now
where we are charged more & have less options. The Access-a-Ride also is an unpredictable system that
requires notice too far in advance, the rides are typically late and inconsistent. This makes it nearly impossible to
maintain a job or get to appointments on time. If the cost of using Access-on-Demand is too much of a burden,
has RTD looked into a creating a ride share program, like your own Uber/Lyft? If you provide a better wage &
employment options you might be able to get drivers from those two companies. Please try to think outside the
box & stop your focus on penalizing those of us who are already dealing with so many physical, mental and
financial hardships each day.

Access On Demand has increased my ability to travel around the Denver Metro Area. I go to places and events I
haven't been able to in the past. Basically, this was an effective program that people want to cut out due to it
costing too much. It should not be the full responsibility of the transit authority to increase the accessibility of a city
in this way, and money should be sought from additional sources.
I work in a location with a dangerous, uncontrolled crossing in order to get into the neighborhood where it is
located. It is almost exactly 1 mile from the closest bus stop. Changing the parameters to 3/4 of a mile will either
limit my ability to get to work or will force me to cross, blind, a relatively busy, uncontrolled street, with a highway
running parallel to it.
Access On Demand has allowed many disabled people to travel more "normally" and it doesn't make sense to try
and give everyone the "same" services. Everyone with different disabilities has different needs. If an area is
wheelchair accessible, someone using a chair can find the right door to an establishment, whereas I can't see to
find that correct door. On the other hand, a place might be covered in snow or have rough ground and I can
navigate over that if I know where I'm going, but someone in a chair might not be able to do that. Don't pretend
this is about giving everyone the same services.
One more thing is that I live in Boulder and go to Lafayette for 1 hour appointments at least twice a week. If I can't
use Access on Demand, I'll use Access A Ride. Which do you think costs more? My taking a ride share back and
forth? Or you sending a bus and driver up to Boulder to drive me out to Lafayette and then pick me up an hour
later and drive me back into Boulder? That's silly.
I am the mother of a woman with Down syndrome who has had a new life because of Access on Demand. Access
a Ride did not work for her. She could not book the rides, it was a cumbersome process, and not always reliable.
Just TOO MUCH for a person with an intellectual disability. Access on Demand has truly been a godsend. She
can book herself! It is well run, safe, and on time. Also, she lives in Arvada which has a bus 'dead zone" whatever
that means so I'm not sure how this would affect her being picked up by Access A Ride. Access on Demand has
truly. been the best thing the state has done in a long time. Please keep it viable, especially for people like my
daugher who can not handle the intricacies and EXTRA WORK that Access A Ride has always been. I didn't
answer your questions because if access a ride is still difficult, she would be stranded. I am fine with the base
increase. why cut down to 30 rides per month. This means she can only go one way if she needs to leave the
house every day. Keep the limit to 25 instead, Perhaps some people can maneuver Access A Ride, but people
that use Access on Demand have a NEW LIFE because of the simplicity of use compared to Access A Ride.
Thank you.
There are other reasons to use Access-On-Demand (AOD) Service for trips that requires a specific pickup
window and can't be in a situation where the location being dropped off or picked up results could occur before
the location is opened or it closes before being picked up, which means the person will be left outside to wait by
themselves which is not safe. Also what if the person needs to be at a location for 3 or 4 hours and using AAR
requires scheduling that wouldn't necessarily allow to arrive or leave at the correct time due to the windows
currently offered. Using AOD allows for a more precise pickup and drop off times, and a safer option.
I don't know who's idea it was to make these changes to this program but it's not a good idea it really isn't u can't
make this program just like access a ride because it's not access a ride it's access on demand it's a better way for
people for disabilities to get around town & making all of these changes is going to make lots of people not want
to use your services anymore so if I was the ceo of rtd & access a ride I wouldn't make these changes to access
on demand & I would just keep it the way that it is right now.

We need Access on Demand in order for our daughter to be safe and active in the community. She uses this
service to go to activities that are not accessible or reasonable by access a ride. These are shorter trips that are
time sensitive and do not allow for the waiting, unpredictability, or extra commuting to pick up other riders that are
associated with access -a-ride. This change would remove so much of the freedom and independence that she
SO deserves and has the right to. She uses the service to get to and from a couple of volunteer positions in the
community as well as other necessary locations.

The problem is I work & having access-on-demand allows me to go to my Dr appointments, treatments & return to
work having to wait on access-a-ride & hoping they arrive is stressful.
I've been left a few time & crying trying to find a ride either home or back to work.waiting for 2 if not more hours.
Scheduling does not try to replace drivers for return trips.

Access the rain is a very important part of many people’s lives. All the people that use it do so because they can’t
afford anything else. Keep the cost low, please!
Based on my experience, I think it would be a huge help to limit the options for access on demand. So, instead of
having all options like priority pick up or Excel, it would be good to only include the standard since it cost less
compared to the other options and include 60 trips instead of 30 trips per month. Also, I would appreciate you
considering lowering the cost. People who do not have disabilities can drive independently, and they do not pay
the same amount of money when driving. To provide equal access, I think it is crucial to put that into consideration
since life is getting expensive, and most people won't be able to afford to pay. I would consult with other programs
in the country to see what they have done as well when it comes to the budget. I know that in New York, for
instance, they charge three dollars per a trip. I am not the expert here, but I just wanted to share what I have
learned from some of my friends to see if consulting with other departments would save some money. Finally, it
would be helpful to bring back the access a cab since it gives people with disabilities equal access to fully
participate in life activities like anyone else. Thank you so much for your consideration and for everything you do
to provide equal access!
I am just out of the boundary of the access a ride boundary. Access on demand has allowed me to get to and from
my day program indepedently and has made a huge difference in my life. Please don't change this aspect of the
program. I think it is reasonable to charge as you would for an access a ride ride ( $4.50 per trip) and limit the
trips per month a well. With the changes in the bus routes in recent years, being able to use access a ride has
made it impossible for me to use access a ride as I am just out of the boundaries due to the bus route change
near me. If this changes for access on demand I will not have the ability to get to and from my programs . Thank
you for your consideration

I need the access-on-demand as part of my normal daily life routine.

I have often said RTD does not take the lives of people with disabilities seriously, and these proposed changes
prove my point. While I agree with the fare structure, and the $30 subsidy, 30 trips a month is simply not realistic.
Contrary to what RTD and its board of directors believe, people with disabilities lead normal lives like anyone
else, and therefore, need more than just 30 trips a month, one trip per day. People with disabilities work, have
active families, and active social lives, and 30 trips a month simply is not enough to sustain anyone. Also, the 90
day period of using access-a-ride before access on demand kicks in is ridiculous, considering how unreliable
access-a-ride has become. People should not be forced to wait for incompetant schedulers and drivers prioritizing
everyone else first before they get dropped off or picked up from their destinations. No where, in fact, do I see any
changes or work being done to fix access-a-ride’s many inadequacies. The lack of disabled representation in
these strategy meetings is appalling, and RTD should be ashamed of its poor operation and its treatment of
people with disabilities. 40 trips a month would still be a doable number, but 30 is too few.
I only use Access on Demand when I'm denied service on AAR. Sometimes, I need to get to the pharmacy before
it closes and my fault for not reserving far enough in advance. I also feel like you should let the cab wait for less
than ten minutes while I pick up my prescription rather than calling for another.
I appreciate RTD so very much; thank you.
The Lyft and Uber keeps charging when my rides are less than $20.00 so I don’t have information to contact Lyft
or uber for the charges. I been trying to take off my debit card but then I can’t get Lyft or uber when I need it that
what my concern is. I like on Demand Access a ride because I can leave when I need to at the time.
I would like to address a concern I have with Access on Demand: I realize many of the Uber /Lyft drivers use their
own vichichels when driving, there have a couple times that I requested a ride and the driver shows up in a
different car completely or different color altogether. Is there any way that a larger decal could be placed on the
side the cars like Metro Taxi even though I'm comfortable with the safty feaures in the app. This would make it
easier to identify the correct vehicles without putting additional strain on me to look for the license plates and
make and model of the vehicles. Avoid the cancelation fees if a driver shows up in an alternate vehicle other that
what is displayed in the app.
N/A
What is the average trip cost across users? Most of my trips are between $10-$15. Have you considered a lower
base fare and
Access on demand is what I use to get to places, like work and school. By making these changes I won't be able
to use this servis. I won't be able to get to the places I need to be in time because I will have to take the buss and
lightrail which can taake lots of time out of my day and make me late to my apointments.
My concerns are with the with the Access on Demand following the active bus routs. As there are some
passenger's lining outside of the service area who use Access on Demand to get to a spot where the Access A
Ride can pick them up, also some areas have bus routs that stop running in early evenings and not on weekends.
This would limit the passenger from shopping or other needs on week ends and also some medical appointments
in the evenings.
Also if we are paying the co pay and the Live passenger's get the discount, is it possible to employee discount as
well?

I am not a paratransit rider, but I have a son who is. Limiting the rides to 30 a month and charging for them will
very much limit is ability to function in life. He does not have much money each month and he will not able to pay
for rides and have much money for other things, and 30 rides is not enough in a month. A person who does not
have transporation needs access to transporation for work, errands such as grocery shopping and shopping for
other needs, and social activities. Access a Ride is unreliable. Access a Ride on Demand has worked very well.
He can be picked up outside his residence and be taken to where he needs to go. Riding the bus does not work
well for him often times as it takes too long, he does not have a phone with service, so needs to have wifi and that
is not available at RTD stations, he is impulsive so riding the bus is not always a good situation for him. The 60
rides a month at no cost to him as worked well. If these options decrease, he will be very much impacted
negatively.
My 20-year-old son uses Access on Demand. He tried Access a Ride but it was not reliable. He can be impulsive
and so riding the bus has not worked well for him often in the past. Access a Ride on Demand works very well for
him. To decrease this benefit to 30 times a month will very much impact his ability to be more independent. A
person with a disability is not different than a person without a disability. In order to be independent, they need
transportion. They need to be able to go to work. They need to be able to go to the grocery store. They need to be
able to go to appts. They need to be able to go to social activities. I think 60 rides a month works well. 30 rides a
month will limit people with disabilities ability to be independent and a fulfilled life. The will only be able to go to
work and then how are they going to do other things in their life with no transportation.
One of the best advantages of AOD program is that I can travel beyond the AAR boundary. My mother lives in
Longmont and I in Denver, and my daughter in Castle Rock. I am wheelchair bound and AOD allows me to visit
my mother and daughter. I feel like the stipulation of being enrolled and using for 90 days before AOD is available
is a bit arcane. Perhaps simply being enrolled for 90 days is sufficient… I try not to use AAR/AOD unless I need
to, and I try to find alternate transportation through caregivers so I am not overburdening, overusing, or over
costing RTD. I need AAR/AOD when I cannot get my mother or caregiver to drive me (daughter is also disabled),
but I try not to use it unless I have to. I try to treat it as a privilege, so holding back service because of light usage
is a disappointing choice for trying to recoup costs. Perhaps targeting the over users would yield a better revenue
outcome as well.
Understand the tremendous need to cut back severely because of extreme costs that excess (sic ;) on demand
particularly has become unsustainable however given the fact that routes that have been cut back and even my
address which is in central Denver area only a couple miles outside of City boundaries would under this proposal
not be eligible for any Access a ride versus services. That is very problematic for people that don't have other
alternatives and should definitely not be the case for people that are centrally located. This is also affected by so
many route cuts that make more people outside of the area. I feel very strongly that this should not be
implemented with such boundaries and there should be a procedure for exceptions to be made for extreme
circumstances because of severe handicaps or income. It is also especially important that some sort of demand
service even if it's just a taxi subsidy should be available to get people to a location where they can get Access-ARide even if they're a few miles away from the boundaries... Unfortunately disability type services tend to be much
less available than they should and I think more thought and study needs to be going into this even though I
realize that they probably over promised and even over delivered with the excessive demand of the demand
service but it would be very unfortunate if RTD were to go to The other extreme and cut back too much. Much
more study and looking at getting money to help from other sources other than RTD needs to be carefully looked
at

I personally don’t like the fact that Access-a-Ride doesn’t stop at any local gas stations if someone desperately
needs to use the restroom especially if there on medicine that helps them go to the restroom easier. I think that
they should allow this to anyone that may need to use the restroom badly especially when there on board of an
Access-a-Ride Bus. It’s not fair to the customers that actually need the restroom in my opinion.
I would suggest going for $25 down to $20 approved amount. I would also suggest not changing it from 60 to 30. I
would keep it at 60 because that is the to and from for 30 days. I would also work on getting it to be harder to be
approved when it comes to, getting accepted and keeping the acceptance so that people that get abused that will
be taken out of the system.
If I may suggest is that I have a approved destination list so like have someone go and get the address is the
different from the grocery stores and medical centers and stuff like that and if it’s on the approved list, then you’re
not gonna worry about the price of the ride to get there however, if they want to go somewhere, that’s not on the
approved list then you’ll limit to $10 a trip
I appreciate and greatly rely on this on demand service. I am late if I take the accessa ride service which delays
my healthcare. I have no relatives in the area and have multiple medical needs/ appointments. I suggest that you
limit access to on demand services to clients that are ages 55 and over with multiple disabilities and implement a
cost to each ride, rather than limiting everyone. Consumers under the age of 55 may be eligible depending on
medical need/ abilities

I use Access-a-Ride for doctor appointments. Can it be used for other things? Grocery shopping?
Thank You for Access-a-Ride On Demand!
Dear RTD, a sincere gratitude for the Access-a-Ride On Demand service provided by RTD. This program has
been incredibly reliable, especially compared to the Medicaid program. I can't thank you enough!
I truly hope RTD can continue to fully subsidize this program for those of us who rely on it. If cost-cutting
measures become necessary, I believe reducing the number of monthly rides from 60 to 30 would be preferable
to increasing the per-ride charge. A $4.00 fee per ride is simply not affordable for many.
Thank you again for this valuable service.
Sincerely,
Lexi
I feel like reducing the number of trips by half and increasing the covered amount per trip is not fixing the problem.
30 trips a month is not enough for someone to go to & from work as well as utilize the AoD for appointments,
classes, etc. I currently live outside of the AaR area because the closest pick up location is over a mile from my
house, so I have to use AoD to get around. I am not sure if changing the boundary will affect my ability to use
AoD, & I hope it doesn't and I'm just reading it incorrectly. I have MS & am on disability so I have a fixed income
and I think that maybe instead of increasing our rates RTD should increase the regular fares for the people
without disabilities who are able to have full time employment. I just checked and a 3 hour pass is $2.75, but it is
going to cost us $4.50 for 1 ride. It seems like the priorities aren't on saving this program, it's focusing RTD's
financial problems on the disabled community instead of looking into where else they can get their money to
cover the services that they offer to the disabled riders.

These changes to Access on Demand are going to make life much more difficult for people who rely upon it to get
to and from work. In my case, because you're proposing to limit rides to during fixed-route service hours, I will be
forced to use rideshare without any subsidy to get to work. That's anywhere between $30 and $50 per trip,
depending on the surge pricing currently in effect. This will significantly reduce my net income per week.
You refer to Access on Demand as a supplemental, premium service. If this is the case, it should not be bound by
the same rules as Access-a-Ride. This goes for the service area and hours as well as allowing multiple stops per
trip.
Overall, your recommended policies are going to push more riders to Access-a-Ride, which is much more
expensive per trip than Access on Demand. If you're trying to save money, this would seem to be antithetical to
your goal. The rationale to make the program more sustainable also does not jive with your recommendations to
reduce the service area and hours, as the number of riders who rely upon that is likely relatively small. So, you're
not saving much money by doing this, but you are making the service less useful to people who really need it. So,
please, reconsider the area and hourly restrictions. Instead of hamstringing Access on Demand riders, why not
improve the Access-a-Ride service by expanding the service area and hours so that more people can go more
places, which is RTD's mission?
Lastly, cutting the trips per month in half is downright draconian. People have built their lives and livelihoods
around this service, and this would be devastating. I realize that the number of trips needs to be reduced to save
money, but hopefully we can moderate this drastic cut and go with 45 trips per month. Again, if saving money is
the goal, pushing riders to Access-a-Ride is not going to accomplish it. Please share with the Board how much
operating costs would change if x amount of riders started taking more trips on Access-a-Ride rather than Access
on Demand. My guess is that this will indicate that your proposed reforms won't save as much money as it may at
first seem.
Thank you for your consideration.

I have multiple disabilities including vision and balance issues. I wish the max rides would be 45 rides max as I
need this service to get around. My experience with the access a ride service has not been pleasant and never
timely to appointments -I would be happy to pay a little more ($6.50?)to be able to use it

1. Provide safe, pre-installed car seats with seamless adjustments for growing children.
2. Eliminate trip caps and penalties for multi-stop rides to meet unpredictable daily family needs.
3. Reduce systemic triggers for CPS involvement caused by logistical challenges.
4. Support parents with disabilities through driver training and flexible, technology-driven solutions.
The Problems We Are Solving
1. Transportation Inequity:
• Parents with disabilities face significant barriers in accessing reliable and safe transportation.
• These barriers disproportionately affect blind and visually impaired parents, who face challenges like properly
installing car seats.
2. Child Safety Risks:
• 59% of car seats are improperly installed, increasing injury risks by up to 70% (NHTSA). Repeated installations
exacerbate errors.
• For parents with disabilities, tasks like adjusting harnesses for growing children (like Malcolm’s quick growth!)
are particularly complex without consistent support.
3. Systemic Discrimination and CPS Reports:
• Parents with disabilities are 1.5–2 times more likely to face CPS reports based on perceived neglect (National
Council on Disability).
• Transportation challenges—missed appointments, delayed travel, improper car seat use—are often
misinterpreted as neglect.
4. Growth and Changing Child Needs:
• Children grow quickly (like Malcolm, who may hit 6’4” thanks to all the cuddles and care!), requiring frequent car
seat height and weight adjustments.
• Parents need adaptable solutions that keep pace with their children’s development without logistical burdens.
5. Inflexible Transportation Systems:
• Current systems (like RTD’s Access-a-Ride) impose trip caps and penalties for multi-stop rides.
• Families need flexibility for daily life: childcare drop-offs, errands, medical appointments, and co-parenting
exchanges.
The Family-Centered Ride Program: Proposed Solution
1. Pre-Installed, Adjustable Car Seats
• Vehicles are equipped with car seats appropriate for each child’s real-time height and weight.
• Parents can easily update child profiles in the program’s app, ensuring seats are adjusted as children grow.
• Car seats are pre-installed, reducing the burden of repeated installation and eliminating misuse risks.

problem also with the cap on trips due to how

on money. My mom and dad took I’m going to
guesstimate about 50 trips PER WEEK just to go on
errands, pick up Grandma’s medicine, take me
and brothers to various school functions. The sixty
or even forty trips also demand we have a family
support network, not always possible.

Thank You for Access-a-Ride On Demand!
Dear RTD, a sincere gratitude for the Access-a-Ride On Demand
service provided by RTD. This program has been incredibly
reliable, especially compared to the Medicaid program. I can't
thank you enough!
I truly hope RTD can continue to fully subsidize this program for
those of us who rely on it. If cost-cutting measures become
necessary, I believe reducing the number of monthly rides from
60 to 30 would be preferable to increasing the per-ride charge.
A $4.00 fee per ride is simply not affordable for many.
Thank you again for this valuable service.
Sincerely,
XXX

Hello
I want to convey how much the program has meant for me in my
life.
I recently received my RTD access-a-ride eligibility and have
started using the on demand curb to curb through Lyft.
This has been a total game changer in my life!!!
I am gaining a significant level of independence getting to places /
appointments on my own! Not having to be limited by my family's
availably, and burdening them with my scheduling needs all the
time.
This is also having a wonderful impact on my levels of confidence
in leaving the house on my own, which prior I hardly ever did.
Thank you for such a wonderful program!
I am very grateful to have access to these services.

Access-A-Ride Paratransit Advisory Committee,
As a dedicated user and advocate for the community, I would like
to offer a few suggestions for the improvement of the Uber
Voucher Program to ensure its sustainability and effectiveness.
1. Voucher Amount Adjustment: Consider reducing the approved
voucher amount from $25 to $20. This change could help make
the program more financially sustainable while still providing
essential support.
2. Maintain Voucher Allocation: It is crucial to retain the current
allocation of 60 vouchers per month, rather than reducing it to 30.
The 60 vouchers accommodate 30 round trips, which are
necessary for daily needs.
3. Enhanced Approval Process: To prevent misuse, I suggest
implementing a more stringent approval process. This could
involve a thorough review of applicants and ongoing monitoring to
ensure that only eligible individuals benefit from the program.
4. Approved Destination List: Introduce an approved destination
list that includes grocery stores, medical centers, and other
essential locations. For trips to these destinations, there should be
no price limit. However, for non-approved destinations, impose a
$10 trip limit. This approach ensures that vouchers are used for
necessary trips while maintaining flexibility for users.

I would like RTD to know that for the first time since I was put in
a wheelchair over twenty years ago Access on Demand has given
me a sense of freedom and the ability to go places and be with
people. I understand the current model is fiscally unsustainable,
but there must be alternatives that will allow those who have
mobility issues to preserve their dignity and live lives as the nonhandicapped do. Thank you for this gift. I am a retired executive

need.

As a person who can't travel without my electric wheelchair, I
want to say kudos to the RTD for making their program accessible
for all. It is not perfect but it is far better than it was at the turn of
the century or 15 years ago. It's better than it was a year ago!
Thank you for all your efforts and keep at it! I will hopefully be at
the Virtual Feedback Meetings.
In response to January 7, 2025 12:00 open for a meeting

Greens my name is XXX 90914.

1 during the meeting, it was mentioned that they might tie access
on demand to fixed routes around the individual meaning if I was
to take access on demand the nearest Stroud is 72 and it would
work. I was a fixed route rider for 15+ years transition to Access
Ride and then to Access on demand. The main reason for
transitioning I found it too difficult to get Access a ride
reservations if my route did not begin any earlier than four or 4:30
AM I believe it was tied into the start time of that particular route.
For example, the zero route on Broadway, the 15 on Colfax have
way earlier start times then say a 72 or a 52 limiting the time you
can access a ride
2 1 quart issue that I had with Access a ride was the limited
information that was given to the writer you weren’t allowed to
inquire about the ride until it was deemed past the window, which
is somewhat aggravating when going to a fixed time meeting it
just seemed like information was available, but wasn’t divulged
and I can understand being pestered by individuals who are
inquiring about their Ride. I’m sure that’s where this evolved from.
3 as a writer, a great majority of my Ride I had taken, I could
overhear the dispatcher and the driver, indicating that they will
not be able to make their next pick up on time or might have to
pass it to another driver. I believe that data can be accumulated
and studied
Thank you for your time and consider

From:

Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO

Re:

APTA Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps

This memorandum serves to update the Board of Directors about RTD’s recently completed Paratransit Peer Review
— facilitated by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) – outline the panelists’ observations and
recommendations, as well as communicate staff’s next steps for engaging with stakeholders and customers. Included
with this memorandum is the final peer review report, which was transmitted to me on Wednesday, August 7, 2024,
and relevant page numbers are cited herein.
Background
On Tuesday, February 27, 2024, I commissioned a peer review of RTD’s paratransit service delivery, to be conducted
by subject-matter experts (see p. 14, Peer Review Report). APTA convened the peer review panel, which included a
geographical representation of panelists from across the country. During the course of the months-long thorough
review, the panelists leveraged their expertise and professional experience to assess both RTD’s Access-a-Ride (AaR)
service, the agency’s complementary American with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit service, and RTD’s Access-onDemand (AoD) premium supplemental paratransit service.
The overarching goal of the peer review was to help the agency better understand strengths and opportunities, with
respect to both ADA complementary paratransit and premium supplemental on-demand service, and to note potential
improvements that support long-term sustainability. The panel conducted a review of RTD’s paratransit operations to
identify (1) best practices employed by similar transit agencies, including for demand-response programs; (2) model
program parameters, including responsible cost controls and sound customer-facing processes; and (3) software,
hardware, or other tools to ensure optimal service performance and program cost-effectiveness (see p. 2).
The on-site portion of the review was conducted between May 20 and 24, 2024. In advance of the on-site visit, RTD
provided the panelists with documentation for their edification. While on-site at RTD facilities, the panelists assessed
RTD’s paratransit operations through further documentation review, field observations, and a series of briefings and
interviews with agency staff, contractors, paratransit customers, and community stakeholders. The final report,
included herein, formalizes the panelists’ observations and recommendations.
Observations and Recommendations
The report outlines several observations and recommendations for RTD’s consideration (see p. 4). It is important to
emphasize that the agency must first individually assess each recommendation and determine its viability within the
agency’s operating environment. Any policy changes related to RTD’s paratransit service delivery will be brought to
the Board for its consideration. Operational modifications will be communicated for the Board’s awareness.
The peer review panelists recommended three overarching initiatives to strengthen RTD’s paratransit service (see p.
1).

Develop a clearly stated vision for paratransit as a whole to guide priorities in the AaR and AoD services
Refresh the AoD program structure to create a financially sustainable option that serves customer needs
Leverage technology and process improvements to streamline daily work to improve staff efficiency, reallocate
staff to more impactful work, deliver better service, and reduce costs

Additionally, the panel recommended multiple actions to enhance RTD’s paratransit services. The following list is a
recommendation summary which is included in the full report:
1. Empower RTD staff and contractors to set boundaries on the AoD service in alignment with the service mission
2. Create a technology and data strategy; add internal IT staff
3. Reduce compliance exposure by evaluating service area “donut holes;” reevaluate enabling legacy
customers/addresses outside the ¾-mile fixed-route service area; and review fare policy to Denver airport
4. Evaluate AaR reporting standards for on-time performance and conduct regular checks on data/parameters

FINDINGS OF THE APTA PEER REVIEW PANEL ON

ACCESS-A-RIDE AND ACCESS-ON-DEMAND
PARATRANSIT
AT

DENVER REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
May 20–24, 2024
Executive summary: The APTA Peer Review Panel was convened at the request of Denver RTD General

Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson to review the agency’s paratransit services: the traditional paratransit
service, Access-a-Ride (AaR), and the Access-on-Demand (AoD) service. The review was held May 20–24,
2024, at RTD’s offices and facilities through a documentation review and interviews with RTD management,
staff, contractors and community stakeholders. The peer review panelists have experience and expertise
regarding paratransit and on-demand operations at their agencies (Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority, New
York City Transit and Orange County Transportation Authority).
RTD requested a top-down review of the agency’s paratransit operations and specifically asked the panel to
1) identify best practices employed by similar transit agencies, including for paratransit demand-response
programs; 2) identify model program parameters, including responsible cost controls and sound customerfacing processes; and 3) identify software, hardware or other tools to ensure optimal service performance and
program cost-effectiveness.

Peer review is a service of the American Public Transportation Association, performed by the North American
Transportation Services Association, a wholly owned subsidiary of APTA.

Access-a-Ride and Access-on-Demand Paratransit
at Denver Regional Transportation District
1. Summary of panel recommendations
The panel recommended three high-level strategic initiatives to strengthen RTD’s paratransit service:




Develop a clearly stated vision for paratransit as a whole to guide priorities in the AaR and AoD
services.
Refresh the AoD program structure to create a financially sustainable option that serves customer
needs.
Leverage technology and process improvements to streamline daily work to improve staff efficiency,
reallocate staff to more impactful work, deliver better service and reduce costs.

The panel then recommended a number of actions to address RTD’s needs for paratransit service including:








Empower RTD staff and contractors to set boundaries on the AoD service in alignment with the
service mission.
Create a technology and data strategy; add internal IT staff.
Reduce compliance exposure by evaluating service area “donut holes;” reevaluate enabling legacy
customers/addresses outside the ¾-mile fixed-route service area; and review fare policy to Denver
airport.
Evaluate AaR reporting standards for on-time performance and conduct regular checks on
data/parameters used for key performance indicator reporting.
Identify an “empowered owner” of paratransit who can get into details and lead on policy.
Implement software that can automate tasks like enforcing trip caps across all AoD providers to
reduce manual oversight of the AoD program.
Review contractor management processes and requirements to improve service and streamline
operations.

The full report contains many more observations and recommendations. The panel hopes these
recommendations will help to further strengthen RTD’s paratransit operations and service.

2. Methodology
This APTA peer review was requested by Denver RTD General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson in a
February 27, 2024, letter. The letter requested that the APTA Peer Review Panel provide an independent
review of RTD’s complementary paratransit service, Access-a-Ride, and its Access-on-Demand program, to
help the agency better understand its strengths and opportunities with respect to paratransit service delivery
and to identify areas for potential improvements.
The letter from Ms. Johnson requesting this peer review is attached as Appendix A.

1.F.1.f

A panel of industry peers was assembled. The panelists arrived in Denver on May 20, 2024, and the peer
review was conducted on-site at RTD’s facilities May 20–24, 2024.
In advance of the on-site review, RTD provided the panelists with relevant documentation for review. While
on-site at RTD facilities, the panelists conducted their assessment of RTD’s paratransit operations through
further documentation review; field observations; and a series of briefings and interviews with staff,
contractors and paratransit community stakeholders.
The peer review team presented preliminary findings to RTD on May 24, 2024. This report formalizes those
findings.

2.1 Scope and objectives
The APTA Peer Review Panel was asked to provide an independent review of RTD’s Access-a-Ride program
as a whole, including but not limited to:







the program’s overall structure;
the contracted service delivery model;
service performance monitoring and audit processes;
the program’s service performance and cost-effectiveness, including a review of per-boarding
subsidies, average fare costs, annualized program costs and future costs based on projected growth;
cost controls and contract structures; and
adherence to federal guidelines related to complementary paratransit service programs.

The panel was also asked to review the agency’s Access-on-Demand program and specifically to consider:






whether the program is cost-effective and structured properly (including fares and subsidies);
the immediate and long-term impacts of providing service outside the ¾-mile service area mandated
by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA);
whether the program has created a new demand for services, and if so the impacts of that demand;
whether audit and program controls currently in place are adequate and proper for the program; and
whether the pilot program should be modified and adopted as part of regular service delivery modes,
and if so how.

The agency asked for this review in order to do the following:






Garner a thorough, top-down review of the agency’s paratransit operations.
Determine adherence with federal paratransit requirements.
Identify best practices employed by similar transit agencies, including best practices for paratransit
demand-response programs.
Identify model program parameters, including responsible cost controls and sound customer-facing
processes.
Identify software, hardware, and any other tools to ensure optimal service performance and program
cost-effectiveness.

2.2 Interviews, field visits and document review
In accordance with APTA’s peer review methodology, the panel conducted a series of briefings and
interviews with RTD staff, contractors and community stakeholders. The agenda of panel interviews and field
visits can be found in Appendix B. A list of the key personnel interviewed can be found in Appendix C.
In addition to the interviews and field visits, the panel was provided with multiple documents in advance of
the visit relating to the AaR and AoD programs and was provided with additional information upon request

during the week. These materials included a written overview of both the AaR and AoD programs and the
results of a 2023 customer survey.

3. Background on Access-a-Ride and Access-on-Demand
RTD and its contractors deliver multimodal transit services across a 2,342-square-mile service area, including
bus, light and commuter rail, and microtransit, as well as paratransit in accordance with the requirements of
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This peer review focused on the paratransit services, specifically
AaR and AoD. Below is a summary of these two services based on material that the Denver RTD staff
provided to the peer review panelists.

3.1 Access-a-Ride service summary
Access-a-Ride—complementary paratransit service as required by the ADA—is a shared-ride public
transportation service for those who are unable to use RTD’s non-commuter bus and light rail services for
some or all public transit trips. Service availability on AaR is determined by proximity to non-commuter
fixed-route bus and rail services, available within ¾ mile of RTD’s non-commuter bus routes and light rail
stations. Reservations must be made one to seven days in advance. When schedule and route adjustments
occur on the fixed-route service, Access-a-Ride services must change to meet these changes of fixed-route
service.
In 2020, in response to the pandemic, the RTD board requested that there be no paratransit service contraction
in response to changes in fixed-route service during the pandemic; the service would continue to expand as
needed when new non-commuter bus routes or rail service was added. While the intent of the policy was to
ensure no reduction in AaR services to legacy paratransit service areas during the pandemic, legacy services
have remained since the end of pandemic service changes in May 2023.
RTD uses the following contractor structure to provide the AaR service:






Contract with Medical Transport Management (MTM) to provide eligibility certifications and travel
training.
Contract with Transdev to operate the call center.
Contract with Transdev to provide ADA paratransit service using RTD-provided dedicated vehicles.
Contract with Transdev to provide ADA paratransit service using non-dedicated vehicles through
subcontracts with local cab companies.
Contract with MTM to provide ADA paratransit service using RTD-provided dedicated vehicles.

3.2 Access-on-Demand service summary
Access-on-Demand is a subsidized curb-to-curb service using taxi and rideshare companies that provides a
premium service to the complementary paratransit service. Since 1997, RTD has provided on-demand opt-in
service through taxi companies; this service was formerly branded as Access-a-Cab. In October 2020, a
review was provided to the board of directors for the paratransit program to expand the Access-a-Cab service
to include transportation network companies (TNCs). In November 2020, a request was made to the former
(Interim) RTD GM/CEO to pilot Uber as part of the Access-a-Cab on-demand services to determine its
efficacy in providing a more responsive service platform for paratransit customers.
Under this pilot program, customers residing in four zip codes (selected for the concentration of customers
residing there) could take up to 60 trips a month when traveling to or from their home address between the
hours of 6 and 9 a.m. and 2 and 5 p.m. In April 2021, the Uber pilot added the capacity to perform trips for
those requiring wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs). In June 2021, the service area was expanded to add
three additional zip codes. In January 2022, the service area was opened to include all AaR customers, and the
time-of-day restrictions were eliminated.

1.F.1.f

In January 2023, the Access-on-Demand program was expanded beyond its pilot stage to the four-provider
model currently in place. RTD contracts with Metro Taxi, zTrip, Uber and Lyft to provide AoD services.
Customers with eligibility for Access-a-Ride service may take up to 60 trips per month between all four
providers. RTD pays up to the first $25 of each trip cost, and the remaining portion is paid by the individual
through the provider’s payment platform.

4. Observations and recommendations
The APTA peer review team provides these observations and recommendations with the aim of helping RTD
ensure the long-term sustainability and efficacy of its services, make continued improvements in its service
operations, and reduce potential compliance exposure. The panel also has provided several resources to
accompany its recommendations; these can be found in Appendix D.

4.1 High-level observations
The panel commends a number of aspects of RTD’s ADA paratransit services. The following observations
highlight these practices.

4.1.1 Ongoing initiatives to improve and innovate
The panel commends RTD for its efforts toward operational improvements and innovations, such as using
TNCs to supplement the AaR service and developing an agency portal. The panel commends these efforts, as
they indicate RTD’s commitment to continuing to evaluate its programs and make changes or try new
approaches as needed.

4.1.2 Contractor staff commitment and camaraderie
The panel observed that the contractors displayed a true commitment to providing high-quality service to
RTD and its paratransit customers. The panel was impressed with their commitment to providing safe,
reliable and accessible service to the paratransit community.

4.1.3 Consistent level of service among contractors operating RTD-owned vehicles
In its interviews with paratransit community stakeholders, the panel heard praise for drivers providing the
AaR service through the RTD contractors. There were compliments for the drivers, many of whom have been
serving for many years. They were described as courteous and conscientious. In addition, community
advocates indicated that the service provided was consistent across the various contractors. These findings are
supported by the results of the 2023 Customer Excellence and Community Value Surveys conducted by RTD
on the AaR and AoD service.

4.1.4 Permanent eligibility and medical verification
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) permits agencies to require recertification of the eligibility of ADA
paratransit–eligible individuals at reasonable intervals. RTD reported that, as of 2022, its system no longer
requires a medical verification form on recertifications for customers with permanent or non-fluctuating
medical conditions. Further, customers are eligible for permanent certification when going through their third
certification and found to have unconditional eligibility. The panel commends RTD for adopting these
customer-friendly practices in the recertification process.

4.1.5 Ability to operate call center functions at other locations
The panel learned that call center/scheduling/dispatch staff can now be remote if needed with the recently
implemented cloud-based QRyde software. This capability was displayed earlier this year when call center
offices were not available due to scheduled facility power outages. The ability to operate remotely if needed
gives the service resilience to maintain operations in the event of interruptions to the call center facility.

Packet Pg. 438

1.F.1.f

4.1.6 Dispatch functions
The panel finds it to be a best practice to have a dedicated resource to AoD trips requiring wheelchairaccessible vehicles (WAV), as well as integrating certification trips with AaR trips.



Active oversight of WAV resources maximizes AoD on-time performance and decreases customer
wait time.
By comingling certification trips with AaR services, RTD achieves a better economy of scale by
reducing overhead and RTD staff resources, as well as increasing efficiency.

4.1.7 Improvement of on-time performance from use of VROOM
On-time performance (OTP) percentage improved from the mid-70s to the low 90s after an employee in
RTD’s IT department worked with RTD’s legacy software provider RouteMatch to integrate the Vehicle
Routing Open-Source Optimization Machine (VROOM), an open-source software program. The outcome of
this integration provided consistent improvements to OTP which were integrated into the new QRyde
software product. The panel commends this RTD employee for his initiative and ingenuity in modifying the
paratransit software system to improve service levels and urges RTD to consider additional staff to support
data and technology improvements (included later in this report as a recommendation).

4.2 The RTD challenge
In considering the long-term sustainability of the paratransit and on-demand service, the panel identified the
fundamental “problem statement” for RTD as follows:
RTD needs to contain costs while providing ADA complementary paratransit and
continuing to offer premium service.
In the view of the panelists, addressing these three areas successfully requires executive sponsorship of seven
initiatives:
1. Define paratransit’s mission internally and externally.

•
•

This will help RTD in making internal decisions about AoD and AaR service investments.
It will also help in agency communications and outreach to the board, elected officials and
advocacy organizations.

2. Restructure AoD premium service for long-term service sustainability.

•
•
•

The goal for AoD is to augment traditional AaR and offer a higher level of flexibility and
spontaneity.
RTD should refresh its program structure; possible options are provided.
RTD should develop a communications and outreach strategy for this refreshed program.

3. Establish clear program boundaries that uphold RTD’s paratransit mission.

•
•

The paratransit mission statement should guide policy enforcement and establishment of
boundaries.
Boundaries ensure that service remains viable, equitable, and available for all of RTD’s
customers.

4. Reduce compliance exposure.

•
•

RTD should examine and address areas of potential exposure.
This will ensure that RTD feels comfortable that it is following FTA requirements when there
are customer complaints or challenges.

1.F.1.f

5. Create a technology and data strategy aimed at RTD’s paratransit mission.

•
•

RTD should look at technology spending as investing in efficiency, with a concrete return on
investment.
Technology can streamline workflow, which will improve staff efficiency and allow RTD to
reallocate staff to more impactful work, deliver better service and reduce costs.

6. Review processes for contractor management.

•
•

RTD should streamline or modify processes where possible based on feedback from
contractors.
This may improve program effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

7. Review AaR program and contracts.

•
•

RTD needs a clearer delineation of key performance indicators (KPIs) among call center,
reservations, scheduling, dispatch and transportation providers.
RTD should evaluate call center contract structure.

The following sections dive deeper into each of these seven initiatives.

4.3 Defining paratransit’s mission
As a first step in shoring up the service, RTD must create a clear mission statement. This is a first-order task
that will serve to guide RTD decisions on paratransit. A clear mission statement can help in both internal
decisions about service and in external communications.
A sample mission statement would be:
To provide high-quality ADA complementary paratransit service with a financially
sustainable flexible travel option and the following goals:
• customer satisfaction goal/KPI
• OTP/customer experience KPI
• budget goals
A clearly defined mission statement can better inform external stakeholders about the federal mandate
surrounding paratransit service—what it entails and its purpose—and how RTD is fulfilling, and sometimes
exceeding, this mandate with premium services like AoD.
It allows RTD to set boundaries and focus on fulfilling its mission by prioritizing requests within the mandate,
ensuring optimal service delivery to customers. It also enables impactful, focused investments in paratransit.
Finally, it focuses stakeholder discussions on the mission rather than individual issues.

4.4 Restructuring Access-on-Demand
4.4.1 AoD sustainability
AoD operates with significantly different policies from AaR in terms of the following:





Fare: AoD does not have a fare associated with the service.
Service area: AoD operates beyond the ADA-mandated RTD service zone.
Span of service: AoD operates 24/7 which is beyond fixed route service hours.
Eligibility: AoD has a different set of rules around conditional eligibility.

These differences confuse external expectations. In the panel’s view, AoD is more accurately understood as a
“premium” service given the way the service is operated.

FINDINGS OF THE APTA PEER REVIEW PANEL

Packet Pg. 440

1.F.1.f

The peer review panel believes that shoring up the long-term sustainability of AoD should be a top-level
priority for RTD. Below are the panel’s observations and recommendations to support this goal:







AoD as currently structured is a replacement for AaR for most customers. Customers’ perceptions of
the program may be misaligned to its true purpose, which is to be complementary to the AaR
program.
The high trip limit of 60 trips per month drives cost escalation.
The panel believes that RTD needs to define for itself what its vision for AoD is. The vision will then
lead to intentional design of the service.
The panel recommends that RTD present the AoD program as “complementary” to AaR, not as an
entirely separate service offering.
RTD should conduct a ridership analysis that would guide development of an appropriate structure
that aligns with the vision RTD creates.
Creating a communications and education strategy will be critical for successful transformation of the
program.

4.4.2 AoD program change examples
The panel strongly recommends that RTD restructure the AoD program to ensure its long-term sustainability.
Table 1 provides examples of how to think about restructuring the program, based on the panelists’ own
experience of designing effective and sustainable on-demand service. Note that these two examples are
intended only as demonstrations of different approaches that could be taken, not as recommended options.
The panel urges RTD to go through an internal process of developing a vision, collecting data to help guide
decisions around potential changes to AoD program elements, and evaluating what program would work best
in its service environment.



Instituting a base fare for the service. (As noted above, currently there is no fare associated with
AoD.)
Increasing the per-trip dollar cap. Currently RTD pays up to the first $25 of the trip cost, and the
remaining portion is paid by the individual through the provider’s payment platform. Both examples
feature raising the cap to $35. The panel’s expectation is that this would not represent a significant
cost increase since most of the AoD fares may be under the $25 cap, and would offer an offsetting
benefit to customers, who would also be asked to start paying a base fare under these proposals.
However, RTD would need to do an analysis of its actual trip costs to determine whether this is an
accurate assumption.
Aligning the service area to the ADA requirement: fixed route + ¾ mile. Currently RTD is providing
AoD beyond the RTD service zone, exceeding ADA requirement. The panel recommends that RTD



do the analysis needed to determine the percentage of trips that start or end outside the ¾-mile area to
understand the impacts of making this change.
Aligning the hours of service to be comparable to the fixed-route service. (As noted above, currently
AoD is a 24/7 service.)

These options are intended as examples of how to restructure the AoD program so it can better fulfill its
mission and remain financially viable. RTD must do its own internal analysis of program options.

4.4.3 Communications and education strategy
An outreach and communication strategy will be absolutely critical for successful implementation of an AoD
program restructure. The panel recommends the following steps:
1. Develop RTD-preferred AoD program structure with room for negotiation.

•

It is important to create a plan that includes some room for negotiation with key stakeholders.
This will enable RTD to “give” something to stakeholders to create buy-in and can help
arrive at a final plan that can provide reasonable satisfaction to all parties.

2. Brief key stakeholders one-on-one (board members, elected officials, advocates, customers).

•

Create a schedule to brief stakeholders in advance of rolling out any proposed changes in
one-on-one meetings. This will help build understanding of the reason for and impacts of
proposed changes. It will also enable RTD to understand potential issues and respond to
questions and concerns on an individual basis.

3. Refine proposal, brief interested stakeholders and bring to the board for approval.

•

•

Based on these meetings, RTD will refine its proposal, brief stakeholders on this revision and
then bring the proposal to the board. This level of up-front preparation before making a
presentation to the board is key to building support. This support will also help RTD in
rolling out the plan to its customers; if the board and elected officials understand the plan and
support it, RTD will be better positioned to make these changes and remain committed in the
face of customer opposition.
Expected timeline for this plan is three to five months.

Two key points to keep in mind in presenting the proposed restructure:



Present AoD transformation as part of a broader AaR strategy.
Emphasize benefits for most customers and the financial sustainability of the program.

4.4.4 NYC and PSTA experiences
The panel is providing its own examples to help RTD think about how to restructure its AoD program, what
goals to use in developing the proposed restructure and how to conduct outreach campaigns.
New York MTA: In New York, the MTA sought to contain exponential on-demand “E-Hail” trip growth in
order to maintain the financial sustainability of its paratransit service. The agency launched a pilot program
for an on-demand service that offers participating Access-A-Ride customers the opportunity to book trips in
real time through five taxi or for-hire vehicle service providers.
Under “Phase 1” of MTA’s E-Hail program, for the price of the base paratransit fare (which equals the fixedroute fare), 1,200 pilot customers were offered unlimited on-demand trips with no cap on the trip fare. This
led to costs exceeding $100,000 per year for the top 6% of E-Hail customers. With over 175,000 Access-ARide customers, MTA concluded that E-Hail Phase 1 was financially unsustainable, and it would have been
impractical to continue the program as is for the 1,200 pilot customers, or to expand the program further.

Packet Pg. 442

1.F.1.f

To rein in costs while offering customers the benefits of an on-demand program, MTA created a new program
structure that is currently in operation called “E-Hail Phase 3.” (Note: Phase 2 operated for one year as an
interim program and has essentially the same elements contained in Phase 3). Under Phase 3, 1,600 customers
are enrolled in the E-Hail program, after 10,000 were invited (the other 8,400 did not sign up). E-Hail Phase 3
customers are offered 25 or 40 trips per month, depending on their prior E-Hail or traditional Access-A-Ride
usage, Customers pay a minimum of $4 per trip, and the remaining fare if their trip exceeds $60. Customers
must pay the full fare if they exceed their monthly trip allocation. This new structure has enabled the MTA to
serve about twice the number of active riders (only about 650 of the 1,200 Phase 1 customers were active) at
one-third the total monthly cost versus the unlimited Phase 1 program.
If E-Hail Phase 3 continues to demonstrate financial sustainability, MTA will continue to expand invitations
to the program.
Following the pilot program’s rollout and extensive outreach to a wide range of stakeholders, the MTA board
approved the next phase of the program.
Pinella Suncoast Transportation Authority: PSTA provided data showing how paratransit ridership has
been impacted by implementation of an on-demand program. As shown in Figure 1, PSTA saw a significant
increase in overall paratransit ridership following the deployment of Mobility on Demand (MOD).
FIGURE 1
PSTA Paratransit Ridership

4.4.5 Other AoD program recommendations
In addition to the overall program sustainability, the panel made additional observations and
recommendations regarding the AoD service:




The panel understands that RTD faces challenges due to limited availability of wheelchair-accessible
vehicles (WAVs). Advocacy groups have reported that customers using wheelchairs are sometimes
denied trips because of a lack of WAVs. This is an equity concern.
The panel recommends that RTD work to add WAVs and, importantly, to train the dispatch staff that
they cannot deny trips. The staff may need to indicate to the customer requiring a WAV that they will
have a significant wait time for a ride, but the agency must provide them with the ride.
The panel observed that there is a lot of manual oversight of AoD. For example, suspensions and trip
caps across the multiple providers must be done manually. The panel recommends implementing an
API or software that can enforce caps across providers and collect data, streamlining the process
(which currently is manual).

1.F.1.f



During the interviews, there was some discussion from internal staff and advocacy groups about a
call-in option to book a ride. Because not everyone is comfortable using a smartphone, the panel
recommends that RTD look at adding a call-in option with the third-party service provider reservation
contract.

4.5 Enforcing program boundaries
The panel encourages RTD to feel comfortable enforcing the paratransit program’s policies with its
customers. Doing so will help with the program’s long-term sustainability and ensure compliance with FTA
regulations. Specifically, RTD should do the following:


Be crystal clear on paratransit’s mission and resourcing. This will naturally follow on the

recommendation in Section 4.3 to define paratransit’s mission.










Ensure that the board, elected officials and advocates are aware of the mission. Similar to the

education campaign advised for the AoD service transformation, this will require regular outreach
with elected officials and advocacy groups and an internal communications strategy.
Ensure that the Reasonable Modification (RM) review and approval process follows FTA
guidance. RTD should follow guidelines specified by the FTA when accepting RMs.
Enhance AaR and AoD suspension policy. The panel learned that AaR suspensions are cleared at

the beginning of the year. Instead, the panel recommends a rolling-year review of rider infractions to
more effectively correct rider behavior. Because AoD is a premium service, riders should be expected
to follow service guidelines closely or lose the ability to use the service. The panel recommends
introducing a stricter policy.
Develop a customer education strategy. RTD should introduce or reintroduce a quarterly
newsletter to customers that provides information about changes to policies, changes to services, new
technology and tips on how to use the service. RTD could also develop welcome or how-to videos
and perform in-field community outreach. (OCTA is preparing to roll out a “Welcome to OC
ACCESS” video; a link to the video will be shared with RTD once it is available.)
Introduce methods for engaging customers without impacting service operations. The panel
heard that in some cases, excessive comments or complaints resulted in a road supervisor having to
attend to the trip. This is burdensome for the agency in terms of managing its staffing. RTD should
find less intensive methods for addressing issues like these.
Invest time and resources according to mission for maximum impact. Continuing the theme of
keeping focused on the mission statement for paratransit, RTD should invest its resources (human and
financial) toward those elements that provide the greatest return on investment for the mission.

4.6 Reducing compliance exposure
The panel observed areas where RTD may have exposure to noncompliance. Below are some observations
and recommendations to consider:


Evaluate current standard operating procedures for approving service area “donut holes.” The

panel heard that donut holes of between 1 and 10 miles exist in the system. FTA Circular language
references covering areas in 1½-mile swaths. RTD should account for these donut holes.


Implement mechanisms to track and evaluate appointment-based on-time performance as
required by the FTA, and update third-party contracts as needed to enable this performance
tracking. During interviews and the call center site visit, the panel learned that trips, including those

scheduled for drop-off, were only being monitored for pickup. Additionally, the panel understands
that the business requirements in the QRyde contract do not include language asking for this
performance measurement. RTD should evaluate whether the QRyde system parameters are set to
meet the requirements to measure on-time performance for pickup and drop-off based trips in
accordance with FTA requirement and, if not, add this capability.

FINDINGS OF THE APTA PEER REVIEW PANEL

Packet Pg. 444

1.F.1.f









Evaluate reporting standards for Missed Trips to ensure compliance with FTA standards. The

FTA requires transit agencies to document and analyze missed trips with the expectation that there
will be a minimal number, as missed trips are considered capacity constraints and the FTA has a
prohibition against a pattern or practice of having a substantial number of missed trips. Through
interviews and in review of contract language, the liquidated damages language does not match FTA
requirements. With the implementation of QRyde, RTD should ensure that reporting data meet FTA
requirements.
Evaluate if service delivery compliance is impacted by having legacy customers/addresses
exist outside the ¾-mile service area, and develop standard operating procedures for travel time

comparability. Measuring travel time comparability beyond ¾ mile can be challenging for most
systems. Implement measures that limit “excessive ride times” when traveling outside the ¾-mile
service area and educate riders that this level of service is premium.
Review fare policy for travel to Denver International Airport on AaR. The panel observed that an
existing bus route from 120th and Highway 85 to Denver International Airport costs only $2.75, but
AaR service costs $19, well above the FTA regulation of no more than twice the fare. However, the
panel recommendation is to review the characteristics of this service, since limited-stop service routes
do not apply to the paratransit service unless it also provides some level of local service. RTD should
determine whether this airport service is subject to this FTA regulation or not. Additionally, the FTA
requires that a case-by-case assessment by the transit agency is needed to determine whether a
specific bus route meets the definition of commuter bus service. During a complaint investigation or
other oversight activity, the FTA may require an agency to substantiate how a particular service meets
the definition.
Evaluate enforcement of conditional eligibility practices. The use of conditional eligibility is
optional. As described in the FTA Circular, properly applying conditional eligibility means
identifying the specific conditions under which each applicant is ADA paratransit-eligible and
communicating these conditions to the applicant. In evaluating RTD’s enforcement of environmental
conditional eligibility, the panel observed that the call center team uses downtown Denver weather
data to enforce the 80 °F standard across the service area. Performing a review of Boulder and Parker
against downtown Denver, the panel found that there can be as much as a 9 °F difference between the
areas, thus leading to possible compliance concerns if a trip is not accepted due to using inaccurate
temperature conditions from where the trip is occurring. In addition, the panel learned that conditional
eligibility isn't enforced on AoD trips. The long-term vision for RTD paratransit should have
enforcement be similar for both programs.

4.7 Creating a technology and data strategy
The panel recommends that RTD create a technology and data strategy; such a strategy can be seen not just as
a cost, but as a way to generate ROI.
Below is a list of items or areas that RTD should consider implementing. Most of these items would be addons or improvements to the recently implemented QRyde system and are based on issues that the panel heard
were challenges either from contractor staff or advocates:




Operations dashboard. Allow providers to see real-time or same-day KPI information and see where
their vehicles are in real time.
Ability for customers and agencies to see trip information and where their vehicle is.
Improved Driver Alert display. It was reported that it is currently difficult for drivers to see these, as
they have to switch screens while driving to do so. This can result in drivers missing out on alerts
related to rider pickup details.

FINDINGS OF THE APTA PEER REVIEW PANEL

Packet Pg. 445

1.F.1.f



RTD should continually check parameters/settings within QRyde (traffic, pickup windows,
measurement of KPIs) and not assume that the settings are correct. This will help RTD avoid missing
its own KPIs due to information not being accurate. The panel recommends spot-checking trips to
ensure that KPI settings in QRyde are accurate.

Other technology and data recommendations:




Add additional IT staff who can provide innovative solutions to address gaps or challenges, as has
occurred with one IT staff person mentioned to the panel who significantly improved QRyde with an
open-source API.
Implement Google API, which will help with fixed-route travel time comparability.
Ensure overall data integrity. There should be a single source of truth about the service performance
and compliance.

4.8 Enhancing AaR service and operations
The panel makes the following recommendations for enhancing or improving the AaR program through new
processes or contract changes:











Perform a vehicle utilization analysis to support the development of a paratransit vehicle procurement
schedule. (An example from OCTA is included in the resources found in Appendix D.)
Consider a single turnkey operating contract with a requirement to subcontract service. (As an
example, see OCTA’s current contract Statement of Work included in the Resources.)
Review current application of liquidated damages to ensure that contractors are not being overpenalized for a similar item.
Review subscription templates every service change, and contact customers when their trip is
unassigned at the start of the window.
Evaluate opportunity to shift AaR trips to non-dedicated taxi service.
Consider increasing eligibility to five years.
Review unrestricted and conditional eligibility determinations.
Implement wheelchair securement inspections.
Implement vehicle pull-out inspections to ensure that the agency does not have a repeat of issues
related to a contractor that did not provide correct maintenance and service to vehicles.
Confirm that staff members have the legal authority to review the results of a contractor driver
background check.

4.9 Improving or updating contractor management
The panel makes the following recommendations to improve contractor and RTD collaboration, to ensure that
RTD is monitoring and managing contractors successfully, to streamline processes, and to create greater
paratransit rider satisfaction:





Hold individual meetings with vendors, in addition to “all team” meetings, and meet with vendors onsite. This will help RTD identify and address any issues with specific vendors.
Introduce a formal agenda to all meetings with vendors, and have focused topics for meetings.
Regular meetings are a good practice, but the panel found that some attendees did not have strong
takeaways from these meetings. Creating a formal agenda with focused topics and action items will
help improve their usefulness.
Take meeting minutes to create a record of discussions and track action items. This can help RTD to
address any contractor issues, by ensuring that there is a formal record of decisions or instructions. It
will also serve to capture institutional knowledge in the event of staff turnover.

1.F.1.f






Reintroduce in-field observations, which were halted during the pandemic. In-field observations can
reveal issues or areas for improvement that may not come to light in meetings.
The requirement to use RTD’s maintenance system is impacting the contractor. The contractor noted
that they have to enter data twice into two separate systems because they are not integrated. The panel
recommends that RTD consider an API to avoid duplicate data entry.
The AoD requirement for vehicle capacity of at least six people for MTM limits the vehicles that can
be used when only one or two people are onboard. The panel recommends that RTD consider
removing this requirement.
To streamline the process of making changes, consider removing the requirement that only the
caregiver can make changes to subscription service. The panel heard from advocates that caregivers
in many cases do not want to be responsible for making changes, and that the facility staff are able
and willing.

4.10 Other recommendations
In addition to the above initiatives, the panel provides the following additional thoughts and
recommendations:





Improve internal organizational collaboration. Introduce cross-divisional meetings/discussions

with Marketing, Government Relations and IT with the goal of improving communication across all
parties, and identifying needs and support of paratransit services.
Evaluate the efficacy of a wayfinding tool. An advocate stated that one factor in not using the
fixed-route bus service is not having the tools to do so, which results in people feeling limited to
using only the route they are familiar with. A wayfinding tool could help with this problem, enabling
more paratransit customers to use fixed-route service.
Perform an operating cost analysis of RTD’s paratransit service vs. fixed route against other
transit agencies. Doing this can help RTD convey the story that the escalating cost of paratransit

service will negatively impact delivery of fixed-route service, and that RTD must maintain a
commitment to serve its fixed-route service customers sufficiently as well.


Evaluate opportunities to purchase paratransit operating base and certification center. Relying

on the contractor to secure an operating base and certification center can create procurement
challenges. An incumbent could potentially get a better deal on the land than someone new coming in
and looking to do business with RTD. It would also help with maintaining or possibly further
decreasing the level of deadhead (currently at 25%). Finally, it may help as RTD plans for a future
zero-emissions fleet, which requires significant facility upgrades for infrastructure.

5. Concluding remarks
The APTA peer review panel commends the Denver RTD staff for its desire to evaluate and seek
improvements in its Access-a-Ride and Access-on-Demand services. The panel hopes the recommendations
presented at the closing presentation and in this document contribute positively to Denver RTD’s efforts for
providing complementary paratransit service to the community.
APTA and the peer review panelists would like to thank Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO of
Denver RTD, for having us on-site to conduct this APTA peer review. We also want to thank Fred Worthen,
Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations, for planning and overseeing the peer review; Joni Hardy,
Business Program Manager, Bus Operations, for organizing the peer review; and the many RTD staff for their
efforts in planning and conducting this peer review. APTA stands ready to assist with any follow-up as
needed.
