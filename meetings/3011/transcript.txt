RTD Board Meeting
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Good evening, everybody. I will now call the Tuesday, June 23, RTD Board
meeting to order. We are convened as a 5:30 PM Mountain Daylight Time. I would respectfully ask
everyone connected to this call to your phones and to set your ringers to silent.
Please note that under current circumstances, the official meetings of the RTD Board of Directors are
being held remotely in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. During this time, meetings will be
primarily audio recorded. The audio recordings, along with the unofficial minutes of the meetings, will be
posted as soon as practicable on the Board's website. Visit rtd-denver.com, and scroll to the bottom of the
page for the link to the Board of Directors page.
If anyone on the phone would like to engage with the Board during the public participation portion of
tonight's agenda, please press star 3 now. You will be placed into a queue, and I will call on you at the
appropriate time. Directors and members of staff, for the sake of the record, if you would like to be
acknowledged during tonight's proceedings, I would ask you to please announce your name and wait for
me to call you before proceeding to speak. Speaking out of turn will only add confusion to the record and
to the proceedings.
Please note that at the appropriate time during our discussion and voting processes later in the evening, I
will call on each director in turn. So please know that your time to speak will come. And if possible, please
hold your comments until that time. This evening, we will dispense with the Pledge of Allegiance. Ms

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Present
BARBARA MCMANUS: 15 present, zero absent. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. At RTD, safety's our core value. And I'd like to begin the
meeting by just announcing, as you may have heard, our governor has extended the state of emergency
beginning June 19, which was yesterday. And it will be in effect for 30 days.
I'll mention again, if anyone on the phone would like to engage with the Board during the public
participation portion of tonight's agenda, please press star-3 now. You will be placed into a queue, and I
will call on you at the appropriate time. There are no retiree awards this evening. And now it is time for
our public participation. So this is our public participation period, which is open up to anyone who wants to
speak.
As it is our custom, we allow any of our elected officials present to speak first so they can get back to their
meetings and attend their business. If you've indicated that you'd like to speak to the Board by dialing
star-3 on your phone, I will call your name in which you signed up. Each speaker is allowed three
minutes. And also, please know that by participating in this process, you are being audio recorded. So if
you do not wish to be audio recorded, then your comments will have to be submitted in writing, and you
will not have the opportunity to speak this evening. If any speaker has documentation or reference
materials for the Board, please email those materials to the Board Office at the following email address-Board.office@rtd-denver.com.
The public participation period is not the appropriate venue for back and forth discussion amongst
speakers and the Board. Please do not anticipate that the Board will respond to questions or comments
at this time. For this reason, it is important that you state your name and address so that someone may
follow up with you at a later time.
For anyone just joining the call, if you'd like to speak to the Board, you can press 3 on your phone now.
And you will be placed into a queue when it's your turn to speak. I will call you by name. And our first
speaker is Dale Ambrioso. Mr. Ambrioso, Could you please state your name and address for the record?
DALE AMBROSIO: My name is Dale Ambrosio. My address is 9906 East Arizona Drive, number 1016. I
am an EVO official of the Local 1772 ATU, and I'm concerned about a few things here. The front door
boarding is wrong without the shields in place. And I think that it's really wrong of RTD to place our union
brothers in such dire straits, as 53 of our union brother drivers have died from COVID 19.

How many more must die before transit agencies, like RTD and its contractors, install the protective
shields we have requested for months now? Frontal boarding is wrong without these shields in place, and
place drivers of extreme risk of getting COVID-19 when they place drivers in close contact with riders less
than a foot away. Why does RTD not comply with the state orders of no gatherings of more than 10
people, and have done so since rear door boarding started, again placing drivers in extreme risk?
Many riders say masks should be mandatory to ride any RTD service, as the riders express concern over
overcrowding puts them at risk. Why doesn't RTD enforce mask wearing, as 90% of businesses do
around town here? And why no hazard or hero pay for the compensation of these front line drivers who
keep RTD in business? These were concerns of mine, the concerns of passengers.
And I believe RTD needs to address this before we begin this front door boarding, and have these shields
in place before they begin the front door boarding. We've been requesting PPE such as this for months
now and just get ignored. Are we that expendable? That's all I have to say.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Next, we have Gregory Duncan. Mr. Duncan.
GREGORY DUNCAN: I'm here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Would you state your name and address for the record, please?
GREGORY DUNCAN: My name is Gregory Duncan. I live at 7169 West Frost Drive in Littleton, Colorado.
And the gentleman before me covered a lot of things that I have concerned with.
My first question is, why have we not gotten hazard pay, which I understood there was $232 million sent
by the federal government to RTD for essential workers. My second question is why are they waiting two
months to put in protective fields when they're opening up on July 1? That's all I got.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Next, I have Roy Harmeal. Mr. Harmeal.
RAY HARMEAL: Yes, my name is Ray Harmeal. I am president of Local 1772. My question is, why has
RTD waited so long to install plexiglass in the buses? We are opening the front door of these buses in
July 1 without protection to our drivers.
My view is that you have sent our frontline workers out there in a war without any protection. Our drivers
are out there 365 days a year, be it rain, snow, blizzard, and now a pandemic. What has been done to
compensate and protect these drivers?
Other than closing the front entrance of the bus for a period of time and supplying us with masks and
gloves, I feel RTD has done nothing to protect our drivers. I myself have been working with a couple of
frontline workers, and we have come up with what we feel is an adequate temporary plastic shield for our
transit buses that would protect our drivers until plexiglass is finally put in place. I have turned this
information over to transitive general management to confer with RTD.
What do I have to do to get this shield looked at and approved by RTD, so that when in July 1 comes, our
drivers with Trans Dev will be protected? Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Mr. Harmeal. Yvette Trujillo. Miss Trujillo? Are you on the line?
YVETTE TRUJILLO: Hello?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Hello? Yvette? I think we're having a bad connection. Try to call back in,
because I'm not hearing you. I'll now go to Mr. Scott Ramming. Mr. Ramming, if you could state your
name and address for the record please.
MICHAEL SCOTT RAMMING: Yes. This is Michael Scott Ramming, PhD, PE. I live at 3356 North
Franklin Street, Denver, Colorado. 80205 in Cole neighborhood.

So I'm not representing my neighborhood association, my employer, or political party-- just myself. And I
have some comments on the changes to service in response to the protest, particularly the rail. As a
reminder, the 8 line was shut down west of Central Park Station. BNG was shut down heading in at 41st
and Fox. The C, E, and W went to-- Auraria West, I apologize. And the H line went to 10th and Osage.
And it just strikes me as really fishy that Northeast Denver, again, gets the short end of the stick. Central
Park Station is 6 and 1/2 miles from Denver Union Station. The trains could have continued to 30th and
Block. There's a crossover track about at 33rd Street. And if the other lines were closed 6 and 1/2 miles
from Union Station, the B line's not even 6 and 1/2 miles long. For the C line, that would be Evans, the
southeast quarter University of Denver Station.
The G line would be 60th and Sheridan, and the W line would be Garrison Station. That's much further
than they actually were closed. I had heard some justification that it was to provide transfer opportunities.
The passengers would still be able to transfer at Central Park if the train went further west, and it would
allow transfers at 40th and Colorado to routes 24, 44, and 40.
So at 30th and Block to route 12 and 44. So this just seems to be one of many incidents where we seem
to get less service. So thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Dr. Ramming. Bob Deininger.
BOB DEININGER: Yeah, he, my name's Bob Deininger. I live at 3675 South Hooker Street, Englewood,
80110. And I'm calling to echo the sentiments of many of the previous callers, as well as to mention-while I understand as you said at the outset that this is not the appropriate forum for a back and forth
between callers and the Board, when is it seems like coins tossed in the fountain.
The ripples disappear, and we never hear anything further. These are some very genuine concerns
regarding people's health, their families' health, their neighbors' health, and their livelihood. I would also
like to just mention that there seems to be an ongoing situation whereby the operators for RTD
contractors seem to have a second-class citizenship. RTD has not provided PPE directly to them, despite
the fact that RTD had the buying power of a quasi-governmental entity.
And I would also like to mention that this is a very, very serious time. It's not going to get better. It's likely
to get worse. And proactive moves, such as months ago looking into and providing protective barriers for
the operators, are still a necessity. We're being told that it will be months now, quite possibly until the last
of the RTD buses operated either by RTD and/or contractors will have those protective barriers. It seems
quite a lackluster performance.
Lastly, hazard pay during a time of hazardous duty is only appropriate. The obvious choice of the fare box
coming before the operator is really a sad commentary on where RTD priorities are. And I'll leave it at
that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Next, we have Yvette Trujillo.
YVETTE TRUJILLO: Hello, can you hear me now? Hello?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I can now. Go ahead, Ms. Trujillo.
YVETTE TRUJILLO: My name is Ms. Trujillo. I'm calling with the same [AUDIO OUT].
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Ms. Trujillo, you are-- Ms. Trujillo, you're breaking up pretty badly.
YVETTE TRUJILLO: OK, I work for Amalgamated Transit Union. And I'm calling on behalf of the private
contractors with Trans Dev who are deserving of, and should see, hazard pay through the CARES Act
that RTD is in receipt of.

With the opening up front door service or fare collection on July 1, we think it's crucial that RTD expedite
the process in ensuring that driver shields are placed in all vehicles to help protect the safety of the
drivers, and with that, mandatory masks for all passengers. There are several other transit agencies
throughout the United States that are requiring passengers to wear masks while boarding public
transportation. Not only [AUDIO OUT] 50 other [AUDIO OUT] maintain social distancing in accordance
with the CDC guidelines.
[AUDIO OUT] know that 15 or more [AUDIO OUT], which again is not safe [AUDIO OUT] on those
vehicles. RTD had the privilege of listening to a health expert probably a month ago that explained herself
that this crisis will most likely continue, and possibly get worse. And she stressed the importance again of
social distancing, masks, and again just protecting the employees and the passengers. So we just urge
you to try to get the shields on or delay the fare collection at front door boarding until you can ensure the
safety of the employees and the passengers. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Next, we have Fern Cole. Fern Cole, you're on next.
FERN COLE: Hi. My name is Fern Cole, and I live at 90740 Canary Street in Federal Heights. And I have
concerns of July 1 of us opening up of the, uh, front, the front door and collecting monies for the
passengers, for the shields to be put up for the drivers and for the safety of the passengers. For all
passengers boarding on our buses, please wear them-- to wear masks when they're boarding.
Also for us to have hazard pay. We've been out there on the frontline, like the rest of the frontline workers.
And a few of our brothers and sisters, actually, 53 of them have passed away. And as we go forward and
opening the city, it's still not safe for more than 10 people to be on our buses for social distancing.
The buses are only 40 feet long. And if you stick any more than 10 people, that's less than six feet apart.
And for safety for myself as a driver, and the safety of my passengers, we need to see these
implemented before we open the front door. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Ms. Cole. Next, we have Jenea Covington-Davis. If you could
just state your name and your address for the record, please.
JENEA COVINGTON DAVIS: Sure. Jenea, 80216. My question is why RTD has scheduled several
events, I'll call them, June 24, 25th, June 30, July 1, 7th, 8th, 9th, 14th, 15th, and 16th to hand out
sanitizer and face coverings to the general public without offering any type of hazard pay or any type of
PPE that is worthwhile to its drivers? I'm just wondering how they can afford to pass out face coverings
and hand sanitizer to the general public, and not to their own employees. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. With no other callers in the queue, we will now close the public
participation at this time. Members of the Board, the committee minutes were included in the board
packet. Are there any corrections from the directors? Hearing none, those committee reports will stand as
submitted and will become part of the permanent record. GM Executive Search and GM Oversight and
Performance Management update-- the committee chair Director Catlin, if you would please at this time
share with us your comments regarding the GM Executive Search and the GM Oversight and
Performance Management Committee.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes, we are definitely within our schedule for the selection of
a new permanent General Manager. I'm pleased to report that, based on the RTD website and from ads,
we've received about 25 resumes.
And then in addition to that, our executive search firm has reached out to people and, has about an
additional 15 people worthy of talking to further. He believes that the slate of 40 thus far is a very diverse

group in terms of race and gender and diversity, as well as diversity of experience. He reminded us that
we have 2 and 1/2 weeks to go for this particular effort. So he's pretty encouraged that we have a really
good slate of candidates that the search committee can look at.
I would like to remind the Board that if you do have any additional prospects, please let Greg know via
email, or his cell phone. And he will make sure to make contact with them. With regard to stakeholder
outreach, we talked a little bit about his progress in terms of reaching out to key stakeholders, among
them legislative leadership, the mayor-- actually, several mayors, Kim Day, a number of stakeholders
from chambers to other leadership, as well as national folks. So we are very encouraged by his outreach
efforts.
This schedule has been pretty well finalized, with the first round of reviews of resumes scheduled to be on
the 22nd of July. And then moving forward from there, we hope to have things wrapped up in the August
timeframe. So with that, Madam Chair, I'll entertain any questions. But I would encourage also members
of the search committee to maintain contact with their buddies as they get information. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Any questions for Director Catlin? OK, hearing none, the
approval of the Board Meeting minutes of May 19, 2020, and Special Board Meeting minutes of June 16,
2020. May I please have a motion to approve the minutes from the regular Board meeting of May 19,
2020, as well as the Special Board meeting of June 16, 2020?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
OK, I heard Director Williams as the mover and Director Folska as the second. Unless there is any
discussion, we will proceed with the voice vote. Are there any no votes? OK, I'm hearing no no votes on
the approval of the Board minutes. I will pause one more time just to make sure.
Hearing none, that motion is adopted and the minutes are approved. Next is the Chair's Report. And I
would like to talk about two things. Last week, on June 17, I was able to attend a press conference with
Governor Polis, Senator Faith Winter and Representative Matt Gray to talk about a partnership and
collaboration in an accountability committee that will be convened and appointed by July 31 for one year.
I would really like to, at this time, thank the RTD Board of Directors, and in particular for Director Lynn
Guissinger, who chairs our Communication and Government Relations Committee, for all the work in
putting together and forging this partnership.
I think it's going to be a really great opportunity for us to partner with key folks in the legislature, and in the
governor's office, to really do a deep dive on this agency. So I'm really pleased. So thank you, everybody.
Secondarily, we had a meeting the day after our Special Board meeting with the ad hoc committee for the
code of conduct. We have completely reviewed the code of conduct, made changes, made sure that we
were doing everything that we wanted to present to all of you. You all have a copy of the code of conduct
with the changes that were stipulated by the ad hoc committee. So if you have any questions, or need
any further information, please let us know.
With that, that concludes my Chair's Report. I'd like to now turn it over to General Manager Mr. Ballard for
his report. Would you please share with us your thoughts for the week?
PAUL BALLARD: Thank you, Madam Chair, and good evening to Board members. This is Paul Ballard,
COO and General Manager. And I have a few items that I will update you on today. And the first one is
regarding the north line. I know there's a separate agenda item in the back.

But this is really good news. So I'd like to go with this first. I've been reporting for some time now that we
are prepared to place the north line the end line into service in September. And we are prepared to do
that. I spent a day on the railroad last week, traveled every inch of it from one end to the other.
And it's a project that we can all be proud of. It's in beautiful condition. I'm impressed with the train crew
personnel, their knowledge, their careful attention to duty. So we could all be very, very proud of that. So
we've reached substantial completion.
Parking and platforms are complete. Communication system is complete. Ticket vending machines are
being installed. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been talking about a September date. Well, we've
settled on September 20 for the service change date with the bus system. And it will fit perfectly if we
initiate service the next day, on Monday, September 21.
And so that's the date that we have picked for the implementation of service. And we're all really, really
excited about that. Our communications team is moving forward on grand opening plans. And we'll be
sharing those with you as they come together.
We certainly encourage any input that any Board members might have to share with us. We of course
have to be careful to honor appropriate social distancing guidelines. So they won't be the types of
celebrations you've had in the past. We will be offering free rides along the M line for the whole week.
That will also help to spread out first-time riders. We'll give them a whole week to give it a try, and not just
try to have them out there on one or two days.
We're also coordinating with local governments along the line. The elected leaders of those communities
were notified before this meeting that we'd be talking about that date tonight. And then we have more
communications going out this evening. So everyone can be pleased.
We're ready to go, and we're looking forward to September 21. So I want to thank everyone who's worked
so hard on this project for so long, starting with the Board and the staff. And it's been a great team effort,
and it's a project that we can all be proud of as it goes into service.
A second item I'd like to report on is another effort that's been ongoing for some time. And that is the
effort to move Greyhound into the Union Station bus concourse. And I'm pleased to report that we have
reached agreement with Greyhound for that very, very important move out of their antiquated facility into
our facility.
These negotiations have gone on for a long time. Our team has worked hard. Bill van Meter, Heather ,
and then in our legal department Amy Beckwith and Jenifer Ross Amato have worked countless hours
getting this done.
But we have reached an initial five-year agreement that will pay us $3 million, or $600,000 per year. This
is actually significantly higher than their last offer. But through some skillful negotiations of the folks I just
mentioned and Greyhound compromising, we've got a wonderful settlement. It's the right thing from a
policy perspective to do to get them into our facility. And now Denver will have all of that ground
transportation focused on one facility. So I'm real pleased to report that.
Another item, my third issue that I've been working on the last couple of weeks, is we have a very
aggressive asset management program that we've been developing. We have a small team that's been
focused on that. I participated in a session this week with our SL Team members, as well as the asset
management team. And this is going to allow us to significantly improve the management of all of our
assets, not just our fixed facilities, but significant maintenance parts, and so on and so forth. And we
believe in the long run, this will result in efficiency, reduced expenses, and increased efficiency.

So I won't get into a lot of details on that. But just to let the Board know that, in spite of everything else
going on, we have some dedicated staff members who are working very diligently and very hard on the
important and critical matters of managing the business and managing our assets. And that work goes on
in spite of everything that's going on outside that we can't control. And the last item I'll mention today-and we've talked about this quite a bit in the last week or two, is the task force that I appointed two weeks
ago has been working very diligently under Bruce Abele's leadership. They're meeting three times a week
The gathering data all of the senior managers have provided in-depth analysis of their respective
departments, in terms of programs and personnel and scope of what we're doing. And the committee the
task force is working very hard. And we look forward to sharing that information with the Board members
next month and getting all of your input, so that we will have a good base of information and data for you
to work with as you address the issues and the financial issues that we're dealing with at RTD.
So Madam Chair, those are the four items I thought I would share with the Board this week. There are
four top items that we've been spending time on. And I appreciate the Board's attention. Thank you,
ma'am.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Are there any questions for Mr. Ballard?
VINCE BUZEK: Buzek.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Ballard, when the Greyhound discussion topic began in
earnest last year, the Board was informed that ultimate approval would come before the Board. I presume
that's still the case?
PAUL BALLARD: No, sir. I've been advised by a legal counsel that, because it is a lease, that that is the
General Manager's authority.
VINCE BUZEK: That's not what we were told last year. And I'm definitely opposed to the contract. Thank
you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Anyone else?
NATALIE MENTEN: Menten.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes. Apologies, Director Buzek, but I do recall that that was up to the General
Manager. And the reason I remember that is because it made me-- I was hoping it would come back to
the Board. And especially I would like to note that now we that it's in place, I hope that we will be setting
aside some of the money coming from Greyhound to account for the capital expenditures that may need
to be done because of the addition of those passengers and the load on the system.
So I did mention that at least twice when we had the Greyhound discussion. And I'm adding to that again
that I would be fearful that we take the money and it goes to something else. And then we're left with
capital repairs, maintenance, whatever that needs to be done when it should appropriately be coming
from the Greyhound revenue. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Menten. Anyone else? Hearing none, there are two
items under unanimous consent agenda this evening. The first one is the RTD Boundary Certification and
Director District Designation, and the 2019 CAFR and report to governance. If anyone has a change to, or
questions on, these items, please feel free to advise the chair at this time. And we will, of course, be
happy to pull the items from the unanimous consent agenda for consideration under recommended
action.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]
I'm sorry. Is there someone who wants to make a change? OK, just everybody make sure you have your
phones on mute, please. Hearing none, may I have a motion to approve the consent agenda?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
OK, I have Whitmore as the movement. And who was the second?
BOB BROOM: Broom.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Broom. Any discussion? OK, hearing none, I'd like to ask everybody if
they're a no vote to please state that.
Hearing none, unanimous consent is approved. OK, this evening we have three recommended actions.
The first one is listed as 12 action C through E and your agenda. The first one is C parking structure
management agreement at Old Town Arvada Station. Do we have a motion?
SHELLEY COOK: Madam Chair, Shelley Cook, so moved.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you-PEGGY CATLIN: Madam Chiar, second. Catlin.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Is there any discussion on this motion?
NATALIE MENTEN: Menten.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah, I just want to explain the no vote is that I'm uncomfortable with the fact that the
money that Arvada will take in has somewhat of an open window on what they can spend those monies
for, which might include hiring certain individuals to do contract positions that would not be related to
maintenance of that structure.
And my preference would be that we would have a tight scope of what they could use that money for. So
with that, that's the reason I'll be voting no. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. I'm going to now go through the rest of the Board to see if there
is any discussion. Director Broom?
BOB BROOM: No discussion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: No discussion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: No discussion. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Cook
SHELLEY COOK: Yes, thank you. Just briefly to respond to Director Menten's comments when she had
first raised this issue, I think she'd talked about restricting it to capital. And for one thing, I'm worried about
that. Because first of all, it's not likely, they'll have extra money. They planned to be using this for
maintenance, and the maintenance costs with that garage are pretty high. But in the event they could, the
use is restrained according to purposes that further transit goals and RTD controls-- that piece in the
contract.
But if we restricted it to capital, which is what Director Menten had suggested, we may forego an
opportunity that are better identified to, for example, partner with the last and first mile provider, and use
the moneys from that to support that effort. So I'm glad we're leaving it as recommended by the staff, and
appreciate all the work that everybody's done to get this forward.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Folska?

CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: No thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: No thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Mihalik?
KEN MIHALIK: No questions or comments.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: No comment. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Nothing for me. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Whitmore?
TROY WHITMORE: No comments. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: No, no comments. I'm happy to see this partnership.

JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: No.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Whitmore?
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And Chair, yes. I have 14 yeses, one nay, being Director Menten. That
motion passes. The second recommended action is the adjustments to the 2020 budget. The
recommendation supports the following GM goal, and its core number goal 3, strong financial
management. Do we have a motion?
SHELLEY COOK: Shelley Cook, so moved.
KATE WILLIAMS: Second, Director Williams.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is there any further discussion on this motion
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Madam Chair, this is Heather McKillop.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please, go ahead McKillop.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Part of the motion was for me to give an update on where we are in identifying
the additional $7.4 million that brings us to the more conservative estimate I the worst case scenario. And
I just wanted to give you a brief update on that, if that's appropriate to do now.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please, proceed.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So we were tasked with identifying an additional $7,425,000 in either additional
payroll reductions or other cost reductions. We've been working on that. Some of them you heard from
the SLT members. But we have reduced the paratransit contracts, as was identified at the last meeting.
We were able to defer-- actually, eliminate, not just for the Southwest Plaza driver relief station project.
That's been something I had on hold, not knowing if we were going to be able to do anything with that
property that we wanted to access around the old Sears. And instead we have moved the relief area to a
different part of that intersection. So those funds are no longer needed. We have made some adjustments
to the claims budget based on current information.
And then we have also, as you know from last meeting, implemented the non-represented portion of the
furloughs to make up the original $7.4 million. So I just wanted to give you an update on that. These will
be specifically identified in the board packet for the amended budget at the July 14 meeting.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. Is there any discussion? I'm going to go ahead and go in
reverse order. So get your phones unmuted. Director Williams, do you have any comments or questions?
KATE WILLIAMS: I have no comments or questions, Madam Chair. I will be a yes vote.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: I have no more comments. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: No questions or comments. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale?
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I do have a couple of comments I'd like to make here
specifically I'd like to bring our attention to the draft COVID budget reduction principles that Director Cook
prepared and circulated to the Board for discussion. I think it's appropriate that we refer to those in this
context. And let me give you the background.
These draft COVID budget reduction principles, in the first instance, are intended to apply to the
preparation of the 2021 budget. But I submit that they are very useful in informing our discussions of the

2020 budget and the amendments that we discuss here tonight. They are also of utility in consideration of
any further or future 2020 budget amendments that we may consider later in this calendar year. So I
wanted to put them on the table now not for action, not for adoption, but for information-- for context.
Now, there's a second reason to do it now in the discussion of this recommended action also. This Board
has, in recent months, begun traveling down a slippery slope, allowing substantive discussions on
important issues in the context of other matters in our monthly Board meetings. That is not our practice.
And it is, I submit, a dangerous precedent, where items are acted upon outside the ordinary course of our
business, and without the proper information and discussions that deserve and that each Board member
deserves.
So these budget reduction principles can and will, I know, be brought forward in the next finance
committee, and will be fully vetted there. And nothing that I've said herein changes that, as I have
carefully articulated. Now I have mentioned them only in this discussion for information and for context.
But I believe they do help to inform the discussion, and hopefully will yield an affirmative vote on this
resolution, which I intend to give. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Tisdale. I do want to share with the Board that Director
Cook did share this with me, and will be speaking on it later on. So thank you very much. Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: No questions or comments for me.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: A question for Heather, just so we can have it on this text transcript. Those
adjustments with the Southwest Plaza restroom, the insurance claims adjustment, what do those amount
to?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Madam Chair, this is Heather McKillop.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So the amount for the driver relief station was, I believe, right around $2.1 million.
And the amount related to the insurance claim adjustments was around $500,000. Then there was $4
million or so related to the paratransit, and then we had other miscellaneous things that take us above the
$7.4. And again, I'll itemize those in the amended budget separately from the ones you've already seen.
So you can see those specifically.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK, and I apologize. You may have stated it, but let me ask-- give a little more
information, please, on the paratransit effects of this whole budget amount adjustment.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Madam Chair, this is Heather McKillop again.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, please.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: So as was mentioned, I believe, at the meeting where we went through the
presentation-- I think was on June 4. I think Mr. Ford mentioned that, through the pandemic process,
we've seen a reduction in service in paratransit. And we amended those contracts to reflect those Now,
not all of the funds were taken out due to the reduction, because they are allowed to keep a certain
amount of extra board operators etc. But as a result of those contract amendments, we were able to
save, I think, around $4 million.
NATALIE MENTEN: All right, thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. All right. Thank you so much. Director Lubow?
JUDY LUBOW: Thank you. I wanted to thank Heather McKillop for giving us a good summary of what
staff is doing to come up with that extra $7 million reduction. And I wanted to say personally that I was

gratified that the actions did not involve layoffs, because personally I think there should be the last thing
that we go to. But anyway, I wanted to thank her. That's all. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you so much, Madam Chair. I have a few things to say. And to Director
Tisdale's point about the principles that Director Cook fought for. I'm excited to see us operating from that
lens, because I know many of you might recall that I quite annoyingly encouraged us to put forward
principles that we might be able to apply as we were making decisions-- particularly as you heard in our
public comment with the PPE, with the plexiglass, with the hazard pay.
And I think that would have been a really great opportunity to do so. I'm going to vote in support of this
budget, not because I want to, but because I think we need to, considering the financial state of the
agency, while also sharing my disappointment that we did not take the tiered approach. And I thought that
was a great opportunity.
And I also hope that, as Director Lubow said, we are not looking to furlough-- looking to lay off our
frontline employees who really carry the burden, and who have given their own personal safety to operate
our services. And so I do hope, even in the application of these principles, that we might be able to revisit
these conversations around the PPE needed for our operators, the hazard pay that our operators so
deserve-- and deserved so many months ago, as I think those would really be beneficial to our workforce
and employee morale, quite honestly. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lewis. Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you. Just a question for Ms. McKillop to make sure I understand. The first
$7.4 million comes from the nine furlough days that we had decided on. And then it sounds like you've got
$6.6 million roughly towards the second $7.4 million out of the Southwest Relief Station, the insurance
claim, and the paratransit adjustment [[AUDIO OUT], is that right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So just to clarify, of the $7.4 million related to furloughs, we've only come up
with a portion of that, because we've only done a non-represented employee. We still have to come up
with the rest as it relates to the represented employees. And that hasn't been resolved yet. But we'll just
show it as a reduction in payroll costs for now, till that gets resolved.
And then the second $7.4 million, yes. There are other items that I didn't identify because they were small
amounts. But it does get it's above the $7.4 million.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK, thank you. I will support these budget adjustments and appreciate the work
you've done. I share some of the comments. I appreciate all the work that Director Cook has put in. I think
moving forward where we're making these decisions based on principles, and we have maybe some
tricky decisions to make again in the future.
And I think it's just really important that they be based on principles, and that we're taking those out to our
partners in the government and the union, and everyone else, to personalize them. I share Director
Lubow and Director Lewis concern for our frontline operators. But I will be supporting these budget
adjustments. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Folska?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No comments. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: No comments on the budget amendment itself. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Catlin.

PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I had two questions, both of which were answered by
questions of previous directors. So thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: No questions. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: No questions. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I have no questions. I, too, would like to thank the staff for working
diligently on this. This is tricky to say the least. I also share all the concerns with my fellow Board
members about really taking a deep dive in looking and making sure that we're working to the best for all
of our employees. So thank you.
Hearing no other discussion, because we've gone through everybody, I'm going to call for the vote. But
this time-- let's see, I am still going in reverse alphabetical order. So Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Sorry, I'm trying to get on mute now. Hi.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead. I think I hear you. All right I'll go to the next person, and then I'll
come back to you. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Aye.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Cook
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Catlin
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.

KATE WILLIAMS: I'm sorry, Madam Chair. I'm here. Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And Chair, yes. We have 15 ayes and no no's. That motion passes what I'd
like to do before I go to the next action item for the evening is, I'd like to turn it over to Director Cook to
talk about her draft COVID budget reduction principles. Director Cook?
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you, Chair. And, yeah, so first of all, I wanted to acknowledge the remarks that
Director Tisdale had made. I think it was appropriate to take this up in the context of that amendment.
For one thing, the motion was amended to provide for them by Director Buzek. So entirely apropos there.
And appreciated, too, the comments so far about offering a lens. Now, we don't have, at this point,
finalized COVID principles. Our original intent-- well, let's say an ideal process, would have allowed us to
meet with a facilitator in the way that you normally develop these things. But obviously, with remote callins and things like that, that's not possible.
But we weren't even able to, say, rely on Survey Monkey. That wasn't viable, plus it's not that transparent.
It provides for those kinds of virtual discussions to happen outside of the public view. And that's not in
keeping with what the people are pledging in part through this to remain transparent.
So just to give you a sketch of where we are, we had the model from UCD. As a way to consider what this
might look like, we adapted that for RTD, and then got input from each Board member, and also from
Bruce on the part of the task force. And then there was some discussion. I will reflect that the main part of
that-- and I'm sure we'll get comments about it, had to do with workforce issues and our employees in the
regard, and so forth.
But generally, I think we've got a group of principals as Director Lewis called it a lens. But what we don't
have yet is a finalized set of principles. The problem, however, is that Bruce's task force, as Mr. Ballard
described, is already underway. And we have work that Heather McKillop in finance are working
potentially on additional amendments this year. So to the extent we can do it tonight, to reflect how and
whether we agree mainly, and there are areas of concern, to highlight those.
So with the staff in considering these as our draft principles between now and the July 14 finance
administration and audit meeting and the July 21 adoption, hopefully, they can still use this as some
guidance. So the request, again, is to see if you can reflect in the comments, if the chair goes around,
your sense of whether mainly or if there are parts that you want to see us look at for changes as we take
it up formally in July.
And then I just would say secondly, the idea is not just for this to be for staff. But I hope it will be useful
and something that we can hark back to to compare when we're considering decisions we're making, and
when we're reviewing the recommendations of the staff as well. So I'm hoping it's a two-way thing here.
So that's all I have right now, Madam Chair. And of course, if there are questions about any particular
thing that's come up, I've had a chance to talk to every Board member-- some of them multiple times. And
I really do appreciate the thoughts that have gone into this so far.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Cook. Are there any questions for Director Cook? I'll
just go through the list. And we'll go reverse alphabetical order. Director Williams do you have any
questions?
KATE WILLIAMS: I do not. Thank you, Madam Chair. I do not have any questions. I appreciate the
thought that everybody has put into this. I would like to see it-- I believe I told Director Cook that I see it as
a preamble to some actionable items. I think it's a great start, and I am for proceeding. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Whitmore.

TROY WHITMORE: Yes, I truly appreciate the scope and the dedication involved with Director Cook and
numerous other leaders on our Board. I wholeheartedly agree with the words of Director Williams. That's
all I have. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Walker?
JEFF WALKER: Hi. I don't have anything right now. I appreciate the intent and the effort. That's it. Thank
you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Tisdale, do you have anything else to add?
DOUG TISDALE: No, Madam Chair. I think I made my comments earlier. And I'm appreciative of the
opportunity to get this on the floor. And then we'll put it through the process next month. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: Thank you, Madam Chair. Nothing to add right now
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: Sorry-- nothing. [AUDIO OUT]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes. Thank you. I also wanted to thank Director Cook and the-- especially her, but also
others that have worked very hard in putting these principles together. I think it's an admirable idea to
have our thoughts in order about what the principles that should be applied to the budget cuts.
I sent around something, because I just felt there was one area that needed more delineation. And that
had to do with the employees and our actions towards them, and in terms of the budget cuts. And
basically, I just wanted to acknowledge a few additional points. In addition to the fact that we support and
value all of our employees, which I think is accurate-- and I thoroughly support that.
But I wanted to particularly also acknowledge our frontline employees for the reasons that we've been
talking about for a long time, and also those of our fellow employees at the lower wage end because of
concern for humane working conditions, and also to take into consideration other budget issues, payroll
issues, prior to going to employment termination. So those were the issues that I felt we should
acknowledge, in addition to the generic that we support all our employees. So those were my comments.
Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I received this about 5:00, and so haven't I haven't had the
opportunity to look at this document prior to this conversation. I would say that I appreciate Director Cook
putting these together. And she and I have had a number of conversations and Lynn as it pertains to how
I make my decisions is really thinking about those that are most vulnerable-- those that are on the
margins, as Director Lubow has also said succinctly on this.
I appreciate this. I'll take a look at this and provide some feedback. And I do appreciate the direction of
having principles. And I am hopeful that, as long as we are applying the principles to our decision-making,
we will have much more favorable outcomes that really uplift and center the voices, the experiences of
our frontline employees of our workforce.
I know folks have been feeling quite undervalued. And so I'm excited about the opportunity to turn that
ship around. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I think I stated my comments earlier that I appreciate this. And I support moving
them forward and having further discussion. Thanks

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No comments. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Cook, do you want to make any other comments?
SHELLEY COOK: No, thank you very much. And thanks, though, for the input. And just an indication here
that there are more discussions to come on, especially that item. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I wanted to acknowledge Director Tisdale's comment about
needing to have this discussed in a more open and transparent forum, which I look forward to next month.
I also think that this good work is a great starting point for the discussion, and I wanted to thank Director
Cook for her efforts on this. And it certainly has got me thinking about a lot more items. So I appreciate it,
and thank you very much.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to concur in thanking Second Vice Chair Cook for
her hard work and her transparency in moving this forward. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: No questions or comments. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. And then I would just lastly like to say, I'd like to thank Director
Cook for her work on this. This has not been an easy task, and I know that it has taken hours and hours
going through this. This is not a new idea from her. She's been talking about this since she was elected
last year.
So thank you, Director Cook. And I, too, look very forward to our additional discussion as we look at this
very, very important issue in the next month or so. So thank you.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
Thank you. All right, we are at the last action for this evening. And it is e, award of group 30 contracted
fixed route services. Is there-- so this particular award of the 30 is two things. It's the core goal number 1,
successful delivery of transit services, and core goal 3, strong financial management. Do I have a
motion?
VINCE BUZEK: Buzek, so moved.
KATE WILLIAMS: Second, Director Williams.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Got it. Is there any discussion on this?
JUDY LUBOW: This is Judy Lubow.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Thank you. I appreciated the information from the staff indicating that this contract was
actually cheaper than what the staff ourselves could do in-house. And that's been useful for me in
deciding that I support this. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. I will now go through the list to see if anybody else has any
comments. And I'll start with Director Broom. Director Broom, do you have any comments your
questions?
BOB BROOM: No questions. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: None, Madam Chair
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Catlin.

PEGGY CATLIN: Thanks, Madam Chair. I, too, want to echo the fact that I appreciated the extra
information provided by Fred Worthen. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Cook?
SHELLEY COOK: No, ma'am. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Folska. All right, I'll come back to you. Director Guissinger?
LYNN GUISSINGER: No thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: No.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: Just agree on interesting that subcontractor does that for less money than in-house,
which would spur on the agency, I would think, to find more of those alternatives, especially with shared
ride services. And hopefully, we'll get some results as we move forward-- especially since in last two
board retreats, we did want to look into transit vouchers.
And I've spoken about what I would view as a real transit voucher, and how that would be a better benefit
for the riders, and also for the taxpayers. That's it. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Mihalik?
KEN MIHALIK: I'll just second what Director Menten said.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: I concur in the remarks of Director Lubow, and have nothing further. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker?
JEFF WALKER: Nothing from me. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: I have nothing to add. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: I also have nothing add. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you Director Folska?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Sorry. I couldn't get to my mute. I'll support this action so you can blow by me on the
next round.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, great, because now I'm going to go to the vote. So Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Folska, yes. Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lubow.

JUDY LUBOW: Yes
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I am a yes. So we have 15 votes for yes and zero for no. So this moves
forward. Our next item is executive session. And I know you guys will be disappointed, but there is no
executive session this evening. And is there any old business to come before the Board?
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Madam Chair, this is Heather McKillop.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: I just wanted to give a very quick update on Via.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: If that's OK? I sent an email up to the Board. Fred and I have had meetings with
Via over the last week or two. I had another meeting with them yesterday. I think we have come to a
realization, that there was miscommunication going on.
And we're very close to being on the same page right now. And I'm going to have an update item for the-we're working on contract terms now, and I'm going to have an update at the FAMA Committee meeting
in July as to where we are at that time.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, thank you.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Is there any new business to come before the Board?
JUDY LUBOW: This is Director Lubow.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Thank you. I don't know if it's new or old. I've never been able to figure out where these
things fit. But I just wanted to make a comment that, in the comments to the Board, there were quite a few
operators indicating that they would really love to see the shield put up before we had front boarding. And
I'm very sympathetic to that concern, because it's a concern for safety and health.
And I just want to say that. I would urge us as much, as we can, to get those shields up before we start
collecting revenue. That would be my personal preference, although I understand that there are real
financial concerns. I'm just concerned about the health of our drivers, and also the public. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lubow. OK, anyone else?
BOB BROOM: Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. Director Broom?

BOB BROOM: While I still served on the Aurora City Council in 2015, we set aside about $20 million to
make improvements to the R Line. And one of the items that I got into that budget was for restrooms at
the Peoria Station. And not only restrooms, but that the city would then continue to maintain and clean
those restrooms.
And for whatever reason, this thing has been bouncing back and forth between our staff and the Aurora
city staff. And it's never been completed. So if I might request an update on what's happened. The project
was called Portland Loos at the time.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Portland loose?
BOB BROOM: Loos. Right.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, OK. Mr. Ballard?
PAUL BALLARD: Madam Chair, we're drawing a blank here at Blake Street. Maybe Henry-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
--can help.
HENRY STOPPELKAMP: Yeah, this is Henry Stoppelkamp. If I may, I could address this issue.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
HENRY STOPPELKAMP: OK, so yes, we've been going back and forth. So it's a Portland Loo, which is a
hybrid toilet. It's not fully enclosed, ventilation through there. But we have identified the location of the
park and ride. But it's still sitting with the city staff as far as how they want to deal with it.
So we have no problem with the installation. We have no problem with the location, and the tie-in. But it's
up to the city staff to wrap it up. And what I suggest-- well, what I would like to do is have a quick white
paper put together for you guys. I can probably have that done by the end of this week, first part of next
week as an update for all the Board members.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
BOB BROOM: That would be very much appreciated.
SHELLEY COOK: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. Oh, hold on, Director Cook. Does that conclude-- does that do it for
you, Director Broom?
BOB BROOM: Yes, thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: I just wanted to offer, if it's helpful, there is a Portland Loo at the train or adjacent to the
train station platform in Old Town Arvada. It's been there over a year. So if there's any interest or concern
about how they operate, or whether they're effective, et cetera, then that might be a resource for you,
Henry.
HENRY STOPPELKAMP: We are aware of that. But where we stand right now, it's still sitting in the City
County, not the City and County, with Aurora. So we have been working with them. We're OK with it. And
we hooked up most of the terms and conditions.
And now it's just a matter of wrapping it up. So I'll get a report to the entire Board, like I said, the end of
this week, first part of next week.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Mr. Ballard, would you mind addressing Director Lubow's issue
about the shields in the buses, and what the timing is for that?
PAUL BALLARD: Thank you, Madam Chair. Michael Ford has done a great deal of research on that, and
actually, covered this last week to a certain extent. So I would ask him to elaborate on the issue, ma'am.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you. Mr. Ford.
MICHAEL FORD: This is Michael Ford, COO. Yeah we are actually putting the covered facial place
guards on our more heavily traveled buses right now. In addition to that, we have face shields that we will
be adding for our operators that will give them additional protection. I did report that at the last meeting.
We have those available.
We do have plenty of PPEs in stock-- gloves, spray, and also face coverings en masse. And if anybody
has special needs, we can also work with them in getting them additional protection. So I just wanted to
emphasize that I know there are concerns.
And we have been working with not just our internal RTD folks, but also our contractors. We've actually
brought in the union to look at the shields, and to get their concurrence and opinions about how we put
these things up, and the materials and everything else. We do have materials on order. Some of them are
backlogged. We're trying to expedite everything we can to ensure that we get these shields up as quickly
as possible.
And we'll continue to work to that end. It will take a couple months or longer. But we are working on that,
and we're trying to put those shields on our more productive routes. So that's where at. I would invite Fred
Worthen to add anything else, if he have any more information.
FRED WORTHEN: Yes, Madam Chair. Fred Worthen, AGM of Bus Operations.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please, sir.
FRED WORTHEN: So I understand and appreciate our frontline employees at a level that many people
really wouldn't understand, because I began my career as a coach operator. So I have really taken it very
seriously that we do everything we can to try and protect our employees through all this. I think that our
safety record has actually shown that the things we're doing are working.
We only had a handful of positives, although I'd prefer none. We've been very fortunate that we have had
no deaths. But the things that we've been doing have been working. But we actually began looking at the
barriers as soon as the COVID broke out.
When we looked at the barriers, we looked at external sources to look at what was available. All of our
external sources that we contacted, they were several months in backstock, and the cost was very, very
prohibitive. So we began looking at manufacturing these products in-house.
And unfortunately, we can't use just any product on these barriers. We have to meet Federal Motor
Vehicle Safety Standards. So we can't use products like plexiglass. The products have to be impactresistant, and they have to meet safety standards.
When we began mocking up these barriers, we actually ran into a wide variety of configurations of buses,
which meant that it wasn't easy just to develop a shield that we could just cut and paste on every vehicle.
With all the different configurations, we had to figure out how to engineer and design for each bus. The
union requested that drivers be included in the development process. So we spent two weeks actually
field testing and asking drivers for feedback.
And there were many things that we had to consider in final design-- not only the operator feedback. But
we also had to consider things like glare-- making sure that operators could physically see the mirrors. So
we went through several iterations of the barriers before we came to a final design. It will take over 6,000
labor hours to produce and install.

This is not a small endeavor. And in the interim, we also have to maintain vehicles for service while we're
producing barriers. We're short 33% of our vehicle maintenance body shop technicians.
We have actually contacted the union and requested that they allow us to use general repair mechanics
to help expedite the installation process. Unfortunately, the union has declined that request. But we are
still working on a plan that we can put it, do installation as quickly as possible.
I'd also remind you that the fleet of new GILLIGs that are beginning production next month will come
equipped with the barriers. Most of the individuals that you heard speak tonight were contracted services
individuals. And almost all of these vehicles will be going to our contracted services contractors.
Also, as Michael mentioned, we do have an adequate supply of PPEs at both RTD and our contractors.
We have spit shields. We have nitrate gloves, hand sanitizers, facial coverings. So we're doing everything
that we possibly can to protect our employees through this process.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Mr. Worthen. I guess the question that comes to my mind is how
many of our buses will have these shields in them on July 1 And then how many more do we have to get
to bring it up to 100%.
FRED WORTHEN: So we only have a handful of buses that will actually have shields by July 1. We were
limited to the product that we had on hand. That is polycarbonate nature.
We are actually expecting delivery of polycarbonate next month. We're going through the process. We've
already issued a PO, and we have ordered the polycarbonate. We expect it to be delivered next month.
As soon as we begin receiving the polycarbonate, we'll actually begin production immediately. We intend
to install by fleet type, with the Artics (Articulated bus) being the first to be installed since they have the
highest number of passengers, and they have the highest boarding activity. And then we'll work our way
through each one of the fleet types until we are completely installed. We're also working with our
contractors to develop installation plans and train them, too, so when they receive barriers, they'll be wellequipped to be able to do a full installation quickly.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you, sir.
JUDY LUBOW: This is Judy Lubow. Can I ask another question?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please, go ahead, Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Thank you. I appreciate all the work that's gone in to create these things. It sure seems
like by July 1, we won't have that many in place. I'm just wondering, I think you mentioned that we do
have a lot of-- I think there's face shields. Is that accurate and could that be used in lieu of the body
shields?
FRED WORTHEN: Yes, ma'am. We have actually procured well over 1,000 spit shields. And we've also
distributed samples to our contractors. I know Transitive-- which many of the employees that you heard
were Transitive contractors this evening.
Transitive was actually one of the very first to adopt the spit shields for their employees. But all of our
contractors have access to those particular spit shields. I know that Transitive and First Transit have both
looked at them, and made them available to their employees.
JUDY LUBOW: So theoretically, everybody has them that wants them?
FRED WORTHEN: We have availability to be able to give them to operators that want them.
JUDY LUBOW: That would be great, because it sure seems like there are people out there that feel very
uncomfortable. And it might be useful if they were aware that they could get these things.

FRED WORTHEN: Yes, ma'am. We actually have distributed many, many reminders of all the PPEs that
are available to employees and how to get those PPEs. And I know that Aaron Vallejos, our manager of
competitive services, has been sharing all of our communications with our employees. And our
contractors have been mirroring similar communications to their employees.
JUDY LUBOW: OK, thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Madam Chair, this is Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please, Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you. I just want to qualify-- Fred Worthen, you're saying that the cost is the
reason that we aren't able to be able to put these shields in place-- or the plexiglass in place on all of our
services before opening for fare paying customers on July 1?
FRED WORTHEN: No, ma'am. I did not say that. What I said is that when we looked at using external
sources, there were extensive lead times to actually procure products. And of course, they came without
installation. And they were very costly. Providing these in-house is actually significantly cheaper. It's really
a matter of resources. I am short 33% of my vehicle maintenance body shop technicians.
And as I stated, I have to balance between producing the barriers and actually maintaining our fleet so
that we can keep services on the road. We're redeploying as many resources as we can to the
production. But part of it has been product availability, too.
Because we're using the specialized polycarbonate, we can't use a regular plexiglass. That's in high
demand right now. The product is very, very scarce. And we're not looking for a small quantity. It takes a
very large quantity to be able to equip over 1,000 buses.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Sure, and are you saying that each one of-- so our buses would all require a different
design, and [INTERPOSING VOICES]?
FRED WORTHEN: The different fleet types do you require a different design. They would be similar cuts.
But because there's different-- like the stanchions that the fare boxes connect to, some of them are
located differently than others.
The entry into the drivers area is different. The stanchions behind the drivers may be a further distance
apart. So we had to custom engineer the different designs for the different fleet types so that they will
work. It wasn't just that we could say here's one plexiglass cut, and we can just start cutting that and
installing it on all of our vehicles.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK, and when you-- and also, when you say a few months, are you talking about one
to two months that we would be able to have our vehicles at 100%, or are you talking more long term than
that?
FRED WORTHEN: Well, as I said, it's about 6,000 hours to produce and install these barriers. So that's a
pretty significant effort. It will probably take two to three months at a minimum to be able to do this.
My hope is the shorter end of it. But a lot of it depends on making sure that we don't have delays in
product delivery, and things like that. The quicker we can get product in, the quicker we can get this
installed.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK, So I know Director Lubow brought up the face shields. And I've heard from
operators that the face shields produce a glare. And I'm sensitive to that because I wear glasses. And I'm
curious if you've heard this concern from operators.

FRED WORTHEN: No, ma'am, we have had it field tested. We have a number of operators that are using
them. We've had our training staff that have been out, including individuals that use glasses. I have not
heard that as a concern.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK, and then finally, I'm trying to reconcile instituting the rear door boarding and the
suspension of fares to protect our operators, and then have a front door boarding for fare collection
although we know that we don't have the proper PPEs to properly be able to protect our front line
workers. And I feel like this is a conversation we've continued to have since March as it pertains to
proactive protections for our workers. And I'm just concerned about that. Can you all tell me how you're
thinking about what feels like to me prematurely opening in July, when we don't have the proper
protections-- and we've long not had the proper protections for our operators, and what message that
sends to our front line staff?
FRED WORTHEN: So I guess I would respectfully disagree with your statement that we don't have
proper protections. I do believe that we have adequate PPEs. Again, our safety record shows that the
things we've been doing have actually protected our employees and kept them safe.
We haven't made any policy decisions lightly. I'd have to defer to Mr. Ballard with regard to final policy
decisions. But I believe that we're doing everything we can to actively protect our employees.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Well, that's fair. I think it makes sense in the context of rear door boarding. But if we
take away that barrier, then it does beg the question, what are the additional measures we would take to
ensure the safety-- or to whatever degree that we can, the safety of our front line staff?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Does that conclude your questions, Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: I would like to know the answer to the question, because we're instituting-- but the
rear door boarding came about because we were concerned about the safety of our employees. And now
we're saying we only have a handful of shields.
But we're going back to a decision that we instituted because of the safety of our employees. And I'm
trying to reconcile that, because it feels like we're not-- I mean in the principles, it says we care about all
of our employees, or we value all of our employees. And this feels in conflict with that.
FRED WORTHEN: So I would state that one of the things that is very different than when we first started
the rear door boarding is we did not have adequate PPEs when we first started rear door boardings.
Masks were very hard to come by. Hand sanitizer was very hard to come by.
The face shields were not an option at that time. Now we have adequate supplies of all of those types of
products, which were not available at the time when we moved to rear door boarding. Now we have
adequate supplies of that, and they're becoming more and more available every day.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK, thank you. If you could, Mr. Worthen-- or someone on SLT-- provide to the Board- or maybe just to Shontel, which I'm totally comfortable with, the number of COVID-positive tests that we
see after July 1 amongst our front line staff?
MICHAEL FORD: Michael Ford. We can make sure that happens. I would also just add that we continue
to track our inventory, and make sure that we continue to look months ahead so we have enough. We
understand the duration of some of the masks and other things that we use.
So we've really done a Herculean effort in working with the procurement folks, and projecting what else
we might need in the future. And we've got a lot of orders that are out there that we're waiting to have
come in. But we're doing that and tracking this in a very comprehensive manner to ensure that we don't
run out, and that we can stay ahead of this continued COVID epidemic.

SHONTEL LEWIS: Thanks. I appreciate that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. OK.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Guissinger. I just-- to follow up, the question I hear most from constituents-- and
that we've gone over this before many times, I know, is why doesn't RTD require masks? And I think as
we try to encourage people to come back, that is a step that many other agencies are taking, and really
does make a difference in terms of people's comfort level.
And now if we're going back to front door boarding, I understand the concern we don't want drivers to
have to take any unusual measures to enforce it. But if we're going back to front door boarding, it's a sure
seems easy to have the divers just say you need to cover your face-- pulling you t-shirt up if you need to,
something like that. I wouldn't expect them to go any further. But I think we would go a long way towards
reassuring our riders if we were requiring masks, and just asked our drivers to the extent they're
comfortable to mention it.
MICHAEL FORD: This is Michael Ford, COO-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Mr. Ford.
MICHAEL FORD: Yes, I'm sorry. We do have signage up. We have announcements that are made. And
it's a requirement now. Enforcement is yet another issue. If we have problems in particular areas, then we
allocate or reallocate resources that can help enforce that message. But we don't want our operators,
obviously, involved in that process.
But we have automated announcements. We have signage. And it's a requirement. We are very clear
about that on our rail and our bus. And I just wanted to add that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So it's not just a please use them, but it's a requirement?
MICHAEL FORD: Yes.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you, and I appreciate that.
SHELLEY COOK: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, go ahead, Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Just to piggyback on that, I think some of our messaging, then, is ambiguous. In some
places, it's highly recommended. In other places-- I do hear and appreciate the announcement on the
commuter rail trains, indicating that it's a requirement. But I wanted suggest that we reconcile those
pieces. And noted that today, another of our sister agencies-- the ones that we participate in for cross
transfer of information, Valley Metro has initiated a firm mask requirement.
And agreed with Director Guissinger. As you know, these masks-- the masks we all wear, afford others
the greater protection. So to the extent we can increase the number of passengers-- especially if there's
going to be boarding in front and seating closer to the driver, then that just speaks volumes about taking
that added precaution to help them, too. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. Anyone else?
NATALIE MENTEN: Menten.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: I am not for required masks. Just speaking up on that. I think everybody's heard the
term "Karen." I don't want a "Karen" environment on all of our buses. And there are so many people that
are healthy, don't have it, and that mask creates health issues for them.

There's just too many people that cannot-- and even myself. And I just wanted to share my thoughts. I
don't want the bus driver having to police that.
They got their hands full enough. I don't want passengers tattling, filling up our TIC with, "I saw this guy
and I got a picture, and he wasn't wearing a mask. I want you to boot him." I would rather not see us go
that way.
And then just on a little lighter note, I guess, while I do have four sewing machines, which helped produce
the masks when we were in a bind, I do want to mention that I have a lot of tools geared up. And I'd be
happy to help put in those polycarbonate, if you get to that point and you need some extra help. That's it.
Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Menten. Anyone else? OK, I'd like to end this by asking
Ms. McKillop, just speak about the upcoming special study session. Ms. McKillop.
HEATHER MCKILLOP: Yes, this is Heather McKillop. So I believe Barbara sent out the future calendar
that we put together. Bruce and I worked on that. And we got input from a lot of other different people that
are doing various other meetings between now and the end of the year.
And so based on that, I've got a copy of that. And we are going to be working towards that with the first
study session workshop next Tuesday from 3:00 to 4:30. That's going to be focused on ridership
modeling and results of the cost per passenger, passenger per hour, as well as discussion from the
Advisory Committee and the Technical Working Committee that was held for Reimagine. So that's next
week from 3:00 to 4:30.
And then on July 7, we're going to have-- and we haven't determined the time that Barbara is going to
work with, I think, the chair on that, whether it's an afternoon or an evening meeting on kicking off the
midterm financial plan in-depth discussion, and bringing forward preliminary work that has been done by
the COVID-19 Internal Task Force that Bruce is leading. So those will all be dovetailed together.
And so we'll be dealing with that. And then we've listed the rest of those in subject matter combination of
Operations Committee, Finance committee, and additional workshops throughout the year, taking us all
the way to adoption of the System Optimization Plan, the midterm financial plan, and the 2021 budget in
the November timeframe. So a lot of work ahead of us.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Wow. OK, thank you. And everybody does have a copy of that calendar. So
you can take a look at it. And thank you, Ms McManus, for sending that out. All right, seeing no other
business before the Board, I would like to entertain a motion to adjourn.
PEGGY CATLIN: So moved.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Whoa, whoa. Who was it that said first?
PEGGY CATLIN: I think I did. This is Director Catlin.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Was it you, Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes it was.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, so I have a movement of Director Lewis, a second of Director Catlin.
Any noes? OK, hearing none, we are adjourned as of 7:11 PM. Have a good night, everybody.
