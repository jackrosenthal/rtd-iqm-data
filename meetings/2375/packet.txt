Subject:

A and R Line Bus and Rail 2016 Service
Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the A and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan package as summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost of approximately $16,948,000, exclusive of A-Line Operating and Maintenance
costs, and further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as
necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
BACKGROUND
As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail service in the Denver region, the upcoming East
and I-225 rail lines also known as the A Line and R Line respectively will represent significant milestones
in achieving improved connectivity and travel times for RTD customers. The A and R Line Bus and Rail
Service Plan (East and I-225 Corridor Service Plan) contains recommendations for developing a
restructured bus network capable of meeting the demand and mobility needs generated by the expansion
of commuter rail and light rail services. Recommendations in this proposal were formulated based on a
comprehensive assessment of existing conditions, service area demographics, transit market research,
route performance and analysis, and stakeholder input.
The study area of this proposal is defined by 104th Avenue to the north, Tower Road and DIA to the
east, Hampden Avenue to the south, and downtown Denver to the west. The study area includes the
cities of Aurora and Denver.
The A Line is a new 22.8-mile electrified commuter rail line that will operate between Denver Union
Station (DUS) and Denver International Airport (DIA) with connections to adjacent employment centers,
neighborhoods, and development areas in the City of Denver and Aurora. The A Line will serve seven
stations, including Denver Union Station, 38th/Blake, 40th/Colorado, Central Park, Peoria, 40th Ave &
Airport Blvd/Gateway Park, 62nd/Pena Boulevard, and DIA. Total travel time between Denver Union
Station and DIA is projected to be approximately 37 minutes. The A Line, by the nature of its alignment
and planned services will replace SkyRide Routes AF, AS and the downtown Express Route 47X.
The R Line is a new 10.5-mile light rail line extension within the City of Aurora that will provide key
regional connections to the existing East and Southeast Rail Lines with stops serving major activity
centers including the Aurora City Center, Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Center and DIA, the latter
through a transfer at Peoria to the A Line. The R Line extension will serve nine new stations along the I225 corridor, including Peoria, Fitzsimons, Colfax, 13th Avenue, 2nd & Abilene, Aurora City Center,
Florida, and Iliff Avenue, along with current stations at Nine Mile, Dayton, Bellview, Orchard, Arapahoe,
Dry Creek, County Line and Lincoln. Total travel time between Nine Mile and Peoria is projected to be 32
minutes, while the travel time of the entire R-Line from Peoria to Lincoln is projected to be 57 minutes.
The R-Line light rail alignment will connect the existing Nine Mile Station with the new Peoria Station
and A-Line commuter rail service. Existing light rail service in the I-225 Corridor is currently provided on

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

the H-Line from Nine Mile Station to the 18th/California Station in downtown Denver operating on a 15
minute all-day frequency. Under the proposed operating scenario, the H-Line would be extended beyond
the Nine Mile Station to serve the two future R-Line stations at Iliff and Florida. Service on the R-Line in
its entirety will operate between Peoria Station and Lincoln Station on the Southeast Corridor. The new
R Line is22 miles long in its entirety (Lincoln to Peoria) and travel time from Peoria to Lincoln is
estimated to be 57 minutes.
DISCUSSION
The critical goal for the A and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is to build a simple, easy-to-use network
that is comprised of a family of bus and rail services, all focusing on delivering the overall network
experience desired by existing and potential customers.
Significant investments have been made in new rail alignments to improve regional mobility. The East
Corridor offers new fast regional train service between downtown Denver and Denver International
Airport (DIA) and provides new network opportunities. The I-225 Corridor Rail completes the connection
between the East and the Southeast Corridors and also opens new network opportunities for both rail
and bus transit. As a result, the adjacent or intersecting bus routes have been considered for
realignment to serve the new rail stations, resources of duplicative bus service reallocated, and bus route
alignment changes made to refocus network coverage. Through these actions, an integrated transit
network is proposed that will attract riders, reduce operating costs, and strengthen regional and
community mobility.
The following route design strategies were used in the development of this proposal, which focus not
only maintaining high operating efficiency, but providing an improved customer experience that will
attract more riders and operating revenue:
Route Streamlining
The East and I-225 Corridor Service Plan calls for limiting deviations to areas that can justify the
additional travel time and costs by high ridership on the deviation – areas such as rail stations,
transit hubs, and major destinations in order make individual routes, as well as the transit
network, more productive and attractive to riders. In cases where the deviation was providing
needed lifeline coverage, alternative service was proposed while also proposing streamlined
corridor bus transit.
Short-Lining
Routes often vary in terms of ridership and performance along the length of their alignments.
Generally, areas with higher population and employment densities generate more ridership than
areas with lower densities. Providing higher levels of service along segments of the route, short
of the entire length of the route efficiently directs resources to areas with higher demand along a
route.
Corridor Segment Consolidation
In some instances where multiple routes serve the same corridor at different points, it is more
intuitive for the customer to have one streamlined route that serves the corridor continuously. If
general travel patterns on the corridor show a higher degree of through travel relative to local
mobility, routes that link complimentary origins and destinations together were consolidated to
increase rider convenience by eliminating or reducing transfers required to complete their trip
along a natural transit corridor.
Route Segmentation

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

In contrast to the segment consolidation strategy, where routes exhibited a very high proportion
of rider transfer activity at a single point, the benefits of separating those routes into two distinct
routes at that point to improve schedule adherence or scheduling efficiency was evaluated. This
was primarily due to the low number of riders remaining on the bus and traveling through the
point in question. These actions also results in routes with more balanced service levels on either
side of this midpoint based on demand.
Low Performing Service Replacement
If a route or route segment performed poorly and the potential to improve performance appeared
to be limited within the existing configuration, then alternatives to fixed route service were
considered.
The A and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is slated to be implemented with the beginning of the April
24, 2016 run-board, after the opening of the A Line on April 22, 2016. The R-Line is currently expected
to open later in the Fall-Winter of 2016. The East and I-225 Rail Corridors Preliminary Service Plan was
completed on July 1, 2015. Stakeholder meetings to review the preliminary plan were held between July
8 and August 10, 2015. A review of the preliminary plan was presented in the August 11, 2015 RTD
Board Operations and Customer Services Committee meeting, resulting in revisions to the preliminary
plan prior to the public meeting process. Public comments were taken up to October 9, 2015, along with
subsequent meetings with municipal and community organizations leading to an update to the RTD
Operations Committee, provided on October 20, 2015.
The Final A and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is proposed herein is as result of an extensive study of
the area conducted by RTD Staff and consultants; ongoing interactions within RTD (Board Members and
staff), and with community and municipal organizations and individuals. This proposal can be viewed as
a starting point for a continued effort to improve overall transportation mobility and increase transit
market share in the Eastern Metro area, through a multi-modal integrated transit network.
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Eight public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between September
21st and October 9th of this year. There were over 100 in attendance at the public meetings and more
than 81 comments heard through RTD’s service change website. Letters from the municipal, civic and
community organizations were also received both in support and showing concern for the proposal.
Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this
report. Letters received are contained in Attachment C.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the A
and R Line Bus and Rail service change:
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited: proposed change delayed until Fall-Winter 2016
Route 12 – Downing Street/North Washington: re-route to serve 38th&Blake Station
Route 20 – 20th Avenue: proposed change delayed until Fall-Winter 2016
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: route service retained on weekdays
Route 37 – Smith Road Industrial: extended to Central Park Blvd. Station
Route 42 – Central Park/Montbello/Green Valley Ranch: rerouted in Green Valley Ranch

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

Route 43 – Martin Luther King/Gateway: proposed peak frequency increase rescinded
Route 45 – Gateway Blvd./Green Valley Ranch Boulevard: rerouted in Green Valley Ranch
Route 47 – Maxwell Place/Parkfield: combined with the Route 121
Route 73 – Quebec Street: extended to serve Belleview Station
Route 121 – Peoria Street: combined with the proposed Route 47
Route 157 – Aurora Metro Center/CCA/Buckley AFB: Buckley AFB service adjusted
Route 483 – Lincoln/Parker/Nine Mile: rerouted in Parker and increased peak freaquency
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system cost impact of the A and R Line Bus Service Plan is estimated to be $348,000
annualized exclusive of the A-Line Operating and Maintenance (O&M) costs and the R-Line O&M costs.
The operating and maintenance costs of the A Line are a part of the Eagle P3 availability payments
funded by FasTracks and are difficult to disaggregate. The cost impact of the R Line (and H Line
extension) are also FasTrack budget items and are projected to cost an estimated $16.6M annualized.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed A and R Line Bus and Rail Service
Plan service changes do not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income
populations.

Route Recommendations

Route 3L – East Alameda Limited – Implement January 2017
• Service east of Aurora Metro Center Station (Centrepoint & Sable) to Ohio/Buckley
will be discontinued. Ridership east of Sable Blvd. averages 34 passengers/day, or
5 passengers/trip. Excellent service is available via Route 133 with 15 minute peak
frequency and 30 minute frequency at all other times of the day, and provides
convenient connection opportunities at Aurora Metro Center Station.
• This change will be implemented with the opening of the R-Line in late 2016.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue SPLIT
• Route 6 is proposed to be split into two routes, Route 6-East 6th Avenue and Route
19-North Pecos: Route 6 will terminate at 12th/Larimer at the Auraria Campus.
Route 6 routing will otherwise remain unchanged.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
• It is proposed to discontinue Route 10 service east of the Community College of
Aurora to Buckley Air Force Base. Route 10 service to Buckley will be replaced by
proposed new Route 157. The new eastern terminal location for Route 10 will be
the Community College of Aurora – CentreTech Campus.
• Connect with R-Line light rail at the 2nd & Abilene Station by deviating by
Potomac, 2nd Avenue, Abilene Street, 4th Avenue, and Billings Street.
Route 12 – Downing/North Washington
• Revised: Service will deviate via the 38th & Blake Station for connections with ALine commuter rail service.
Route 19 - North Pecos

west of 30th & Downing to downtown Denver will be served by existing D-Line
Light Rail and extended Route 43, operating via Stout and California Streets.
• Route 34 will operate via Holly Street and Smith Road to Central Park Station, in
order to serve the Denver Rescue Mission homeless shelter at Smith/Kearney.
Current Route 38 passengers between Holly and Quebec on 38th Avenue may use
Route 34 on Smith Road or Route 43 on Martin Luther King Blvd.
Route 37 – Smith Road Industrial NEW (Replaces Route 153 on Smith Road, Route 44 on
40th Ave, and Route 40 on 49th Ave.)
• New Route 37 will provide peak period access to the industrial areas along Smith
Road, operating between the Peoria Station and Airport & 40th Station via Smith
Road, Sable, Moncrieff, 32nd Avenue, Airport Blvd, and Salida St.
• Revised: Route 37 will be extended west from Peoria Station via Smith Road, the
Denver Correctional Complex, Havana Street, 40th Avenue, and Central Park Blvd.
to Central Park Station. From Central Park Station it will replace current Route 40
service via Quebec Street, 48th/49th Avenues and Colorado Blvd. to the 40th &
Colorado Station. This segment was originally proposed to be operated by Route
44. Proposed Route 37 frequency and span of service will be similar.
Route 38 – 38th Avenue SPLIT
• Route 38 service east of downtown Denver replaced by new Route 34. See Route
34 for full description. Route 38 service on West 38th Avenue will remain
unchanged.
Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard
• Route 40 will be rerouted via 40th Avenue and Jackson Street to serve the 40th &
Colorado Station for connections with A-Line rail service.
• The peak period branch east of Dahlia Street to Central Park Station (Stapleton) will
be discontinued. Service along 48th and 49th Avenues through the Stapleton
Industrial area will instead be provided by selected peak trips of the Route 37 from
Colorado to Central Park Station.
Route 42 – Central Park/Montbello/Green Valley Ranch NEW (Replaces Route 43 east of
Central Park Station)
• New Route 42 will replace existing Route 43 east of Central Park Station to
Montbello and Green Valley Ranch. Route 42 will operate via Central Park Blvd.,
46th Avenue and Willow Street, serving the Shops at Northfield, then via the
current Route 43 alignment via 47th Avenue, through Montbello via Albrook Dr.,

12:00 noon
The meeting began at 12:00pm with12 members of the public present and 6 RTD staff
members. After a description of the purpose of the meeting, comments concerning the
service change were heard. Most of the comments were in the nature of questions going
after specifics on the service changes as follows:
- a current customer who often takes very early flights from DIA – often around 6:00 am
and was concerned whether the new rail would be operating early enough to get him to
these flights on time.
-concerns about how the changes to Route 10 would affect service on routes 10, 40, 43
& 73
-a person who works as a transportation coordinator for the Aurora Public Schools is
concerned about the accessibility for students to many of their education facilities if the
Route 10 is cut back. The additional service proposed for routes 157 and 169 were
explained to her, but we will be in further contact to work out as many details as need be
and resources can provide.
-a customer who lives in a Senior Citizens High Rise near 26th & Newton was concerned
that our proposed changes to the route 28 would cut her service on the west side.
-a customer who has recently moved to the Park Hill neighborhood, partly because of the
availability of bus service, is concerned about the discontinuance of this route in this
neighborhood. He lives in-between the route 20 and the route 43. He said that he could
use the route 20, but often has found that he’s had to wait past a “bus or two” because
these buses being overloaded with, what he presumed to be students going to East High
School. He wanted to know that RTD’s “philosophy” was regarding getting people from
their cars: whether RTD wants to provide bus service that would be accessed from their
homes or whether RTD wants them to drive to PnR locations.

RTD Director Ton Tobiassen
I am sending you my thoughts regarding the schedule change on the 130H. I am a
resident at Heather Gardens, visually handicapped, retired; and work part time
and like myself, there are others at HG who depend on public transportation on a
daily basis. In order to ride the 130 it would require a walk of up to one mile which
would be difficult for some seniors and riskyespecially during inclement weather.
I would also point out that cancelling route 130H will not add ridership, but will
drop those passengers using the service through heather Gardens on Marina Drive.
Putting the bus out on Yale for one mile to Peoria accomplishes nothing as this line
is already served by the 130 and 131. Please reconsider the proposed change.
Thank you for your consideration

The Stapleton Foundation for Sustainable Urban Communities, in partnership with residents, Denver
Health, and several local community organizations, as part of an Racial and Ethnic Approaches to
Community Health (REACH) grant award from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) hosted several
Community forums and Stakeholder meetings with community members from Northeast Park Hill,
Greater Park Hill, Stapleton, Northwest Aurora and Montbello neighborhoods in the Spring of 2015. The
most recent Stakeholder group (17 people) meeting brought together community residents and
members of RTD staff to discuss the proposed service plans for the new Commuter Rail line. During this
meeting the following was discussed:
Transportation Stakeholder Meeting
Wednesday, August 5, 2015, 6:00p
7350 E. 29th Ave., Suite 204, Denver, Colorado 80238

Transit users expressed concerns with the proposed discontinuation of the Route #28 East of
Downtown in the Northeast Park Hill neighborhood. Although the ridership may be low, there
are frequent users during peak times. Many students use the Route #28 to get to better schools
outside of their neighborhood and if it is discontinued it will place an undue burden on the
community. Also, one transit user rode the #28 to the meeting catching it from downtown at
5:30 pm and noted that the bus had 30 passengers on the trip. The majority of these riders are
commuters traveling home from work. Although there is a proposal to expand services along
MLK, Stakeholders expressed concern for the older demographic that utilize transit not being
able to walk the additional distance to access this route. Stakeholders would like to see the
route revisited to identify ways to maintain the route for students, seniors and weekday
commuters. Would like to connect RTD with DPS regarding concern about student transit users.
When RTD starts public meeting process a number will be provided for public comment.
Residents have also inquired about accessibility to bike paths and B-Cycle expansion to cover the
new A-line commuter rail stations.
Residents of Montbello expressed concern over the consolidation of routes in the Montbello
neighborhood. The proposed changes will have a large negative impact on the community and
greatly increase the walking distance between routes. Consider that while decisions are made
based on ridership. If only, 4% this low percent could impact 12,000 people.
Montbello Residents also needed clarity around the proposed closure and relocation of the 40th
and Albrook Park-n-Ride to the Commuter Rail station at Smith Road and Peoria. There is a lot
of confusion around the Park-n-Ride is closing. Be careful about how communicating. It is
important to communicate that the Park part is closing but there will still be bus ride service at
that location. Although the bus service will still service the 40th and Albrook location, residents
are concerned about the safety of moving all bus boarding to Albrook. An alternative put forth
is to maintain the off-street turn around for the busses while moving the parking to the
Commuter Rail station. Residents are also willing to discuss additional alternatives that will
make boarding the bus at 40th and Albrook safe for all.
Residents requested that information be communicated better to the public about fare zones.
Stapleton residents charged RTD to look for more affordable solutions for bus passes (i.e.
income based bus passes) so one would not have to go through Department of Human Services
or some community agency.

The Stapleton Foundation for Sustainable Urban Communities, in partnership with residents, Denver
Health, and several local community organizations, as part of an Racial and Ethnic Approaches to
Community Health (REACH) grant award from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) hosted several
Community forums and Stakeholder meetings with community members from Northeast Park Hill,
Greater Park Hill, Stapleton, Northwest Aurora and Montbello neighborhoods in the Spring of 2015. The
most recent Stakeholder group (17 people) meeting brought together community residents and
members of RTD staff to discuss the proposed service plans for the new Commuter Rail line. During this
meeting the following was discussed:
Transportation Stakeholder Meeting

Transit users expressed concerns with the proposed discontinuation of the Route #28 East of
Downtown in the Northeast Park Hill neighborhood. Although the ridership may be low, there
are frequent users during peak times. Many students use the Route #28 to get to better schools
outside of their neighborhood and if it is discontinued it will place an undue burden on the
community. Also, one transit user rode the #28 to the meeting catching it from downtown at
5:30 pm and noted that the bus had 30 passengers on the trip. The majority of these riders are
commuters traveling home from work. Although there is a proposal to expand services along
MLK, Stakeholders expressed concern for the older demographic that utilize transit not being
able to walk the additional distance to access this route. Stakeholders would like to see the
route revisited to identify ways to maintain the route for students, seniors and weekday
commuters. Would like to connect RTD with DPS regarding concern about student transit users.
When RTD starts public meeting process a number will be provided for public comment.
Residents have also inquired about accessibility to bike paths and B-Cycle expansion to cover the
new A-line commuter rail stations.
Residents of Montbello expressed concern over the consolidation of routes in the Montbello
neighborhood. The proposed changes will have a large negative impact on the community and
greatly increase the walking distance between routes. Consider that while decisions are made
based on ridership. If only, 4% this low percent could impact 12,000 people.
Montbello Residents also needed clarity around the proposed closure and relocation of the 40th
and Albrook Park-n-Ride to the Commuter Rail station at Smith Road and Peoria. There is a lot
of confusion around the Park-n-Ride is closing. Be careful about how communicating. It is
important to communicate that the Park part is closing but there will still be bus ride service at
that location. Although the bus service will still service the 40th and Albrook location, residents
are concerned about the safety of moving all bus boarding to Albrook. An alternative put forth
is to maintain the off-street turn around for the busses while moving the parking to the
Commuter Rail station. Residents are also willing to discuss additional alternatives that will
make boarding the bus at 40th and Albrook safe for all.
Residents requested that information be communicated better to the public about fare zones.

1. Station Area Plans - In the Relevant Studies section, it would be helpful to add all CCD station
area plans. CCD stations with completed station area plans relevant to these service plans
include 41st and Fox (Gold), 38th and Blake, Elyria-Swansea Neighborhood, and 61st and Pena (all
East). Many of these plans include bus service other transit related recommendations. Has RTD
reviewed these documents and considered any of the recommendations?
2. The plan and associated maps do not clearly explain what is happening to existing services
within the plan area. It would help if all routes not affected by any proposed changes are
identified in the document. Two examples noted include:
a. Route 48 – This route serves Elyria-Swansea and the Brighton Blvd corridor and it’s
omitted from the service plan. This route currently serves a key portion of Swansea that
should maintain service. Map 9 may show the route, but it is not marked, and map 10
appears to omit the route and others identified on map 9 that are not identified as
discontinued on that map.
b. Route 38 – This route on 38th Avenue is not mentioned in the Gold/NW plan document.
3. Pena Blvd Station (61st and Pena):
a. Please include in all plan maps
b. As the A line begins operations, it might be useful for RTD to monitor utilization patterns
of commuters for both the Pena Blvd and 40th and Airport stations. Potential demand
from residents in Commerce City (Reunion) and Green Valley Ranch may justify service
to the Pena Blvd Station via Tower Road in the near future.
4. All figures showing access to stations do not include bicycles. Several stations, such as 38th and
Blake and 41st and Fox may have a significant amount of access by bike. If data is available,
please include bicycle access in these figures. If bicycle access was not modeled, the plan should
note that omission and discuss how RTD is currently planning to provide bicycle parking at the
stations and willingness to monitor the need to calibrate bicycle parking at stations moving
forward.
5. Are there plans for improved wayfinding for riders to access the rail stations? Example is Route
34 is approximately 2 blocks from the 38th and Blake station but turns south on Downing. Riders
wishing to access DUS from Route 34 could alight at the Bruce Randolph/Downing stop and walk
to the 38th and Blake station if given notice of that opportunity.
6. Call-n-ride service is mentioned multiple times as a way to close gaps in the service area. It
would be beneficial if the plan details RTD’s current and future ability to provide enough
shuttles to meet this service demand (either through RTD or third party providers)
7. The first/last mile connection topic is gaining momentum in regional conversations. While RTD
has policy and funding limits on what can be implemented for the first/last mile connections for
other modes of travel in station/stop areas, it would be helpful to add in a general statement to
the service plans, in addition to alternative transit for first/last mile section, about what RTD is
able to implement to contribute those connections for other modes (bicycle, pedestrian, etc.),

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: November 4, 2015

From:

John Tarbert, Acting AGM, Safety, Security
and Facilities

GM

Date:

November 4, 2015

Board Meeting Date: November 17, 2015

Subject:

Authorization to purchase additional software
maintenance and new software licenses for
eFORCE

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to amend an existing contract with
IntelliChoice (Contract 10DH020) exercise up to two additional option years for software
maintenance and to purchase new software licenses for the eFORCE Transit Fare Enforcement
Software and Records Management Software. The software maintenance is essential to maintain
the existing software. The new software licenses are needed to operate the software on a new
hardware device. This will increase the authorized amount by $600,000 from the current contract
value of $884,300 to a total authorized amount of $1,484,300.
BACKGROUND:
eFORCE is the current Citation and Records Management Software (RMS) for the Transit Police in the
Security Command Center (SCC). It is a webhosted solution that does not have central software or
records management at RTD facilities. This software has been successfully in use for the past four
years and contains RTD’s associated historic citation records. The eFORCE mobile (handheld) software
integrates with the eFORCE hosted software. The mobile handhelds provide the officers with immediate
access to a rider’s prior citations and allows an automated mobile process for citation issuance. The
eFORCE hosted software provides data warehousing and reporting capabilities.
The software
maintenance contract for this software expires on December 6, 2015 and needs to be renewed. There
are two option years for software maintenance in the existing contract.
RTD currently uses Motorola MC75 handheld units as handheld smart media readers (HSMRs). The
MC75 units are loaded with Xerox fare validation software, which enables RTD personnel to validate
fares and eFORCE citation software provides for, issuing of citations, if passengers are traveling without
valid fare. These handheld units are obsolete and it is nearly impossible for RTD to get replacement
units or repair parts. Another consideration is these units frequently freeze in the field when RTD
personnel try to switch between the Xerox and eFORCE software.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD plans to procure new HSMR devices to replace the obsolete Motorola handheld units. Additional
HSMRs will be procured to address fare enforcement for FasTrack expansion. Windows CE Embedded is
the operating system for the current software. It is no longer fully supported. Therefore, updated fare
validation and citation software will be needed for the new HSMR devices from both IntelliChoice and
Xerox.

Packet Pg. 39

1.B.2

Based on an assessment of RTD’s needs, peer agency review and a market review of potential devices,
RTD has identified Apple iOS based devices as the future corporate standard for HSMR devices. The
unit cost for each iPhone with peripherals is about $1000 less than the initial cost of the Motorola
handheld units. Because we plan to purchase 175 units, this is $175,000 in savings. For other
agencies the vendor, eFORCE has also developed an iOS based fare enforcement software application
and RTD is planning to procure and implement this on the new HSMR devices.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding of $290,640 for the two years of software maintenance options is included in the 2015 and
2016 expense budgets for Safety, Security and Facilities. Funding for the new eFORCE software
licenses is included in the 2016 SBP.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to amend the contract with
IntelliChoice (Contract 10DH020) to exercise up to additional two option years for eFORCE
software maintenance and purchase new software licenses for the eFORCE iOS Transit Fare
Enforcement Software. This action grants authority to amend the contract in an amount not
to exceed $1,484,300. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to amend the contract with
IntelliChoice (Contract 10DH020) to exercise up to additional two option years for eFORCE
software maintenance and purchase new software licenses for the eFORCE iOS Transit Fare
Enforcement Software. This is not recommended because RTD Transit Police would be
unable to provide automated fare violation citations or records management for fare violators.
RTD’s historical citation records with IntelliChoice would need to be obtained and archived for
records management.
