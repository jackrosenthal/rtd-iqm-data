#### 1. University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail 2016 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the University of Colorado A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plan package as summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $17,078,000, exclusive of University of Colorado A Line Operating and Maintenance costs, and further, to authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, introduced Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, Jeff Dunning, Senior Service Planner/Scheduler – East Team, and Michael Washington, Title VI Manager.  He explained that as has been RTD’s standard practice, whenever a rail line is opened the bus service is redesigned in order to feed the rail stations while at the same time maintaining bus service to meet local service needs.  He stated this is done by redeploying RTD’s existing resources to provide access to an integrated system that provides service to many more destinations in the metro area.  He shared that this had been done for all of RTD’s prior openings.

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that the University of Colorado A Line (A Line) would be opening April 22, 2016.  As a result of this opening, the normal runboard that would normally take place in May of 2016 will be moved to April 22, 2016.  He explained that as a result of this accelerated date, everything in the normal service change process would be accelerated by one month as well.  He said that normally staff would present their initial service change recommendations in January with request for final approval in February.  Due to the accelerated schedule staff will present the initial service change recommendations in December with a request for approval in January.  He stated that because the service changes associated with opening new rail lines can be overwhelming and daunting, staff is presenting these to the Board separate from the normal runboard changes.  He noted that there is a great deal of behind the scenes work for staff and approving the service plan for the A and R Lines now will allow for the time necessary to complete those changes.

Bruce Abel recognized that there has been a great deal of conversation from the Montbello Organizing Committee regarding the perspective service plan for their community.  He knows that the Board received a letter from the Montbello Organizing Committee requesting there be a 6 month delay before any changes are recommended; however, it is not staff’s intent to recommend a delay.  Staff is requesting approval of the A and R Line service plan for implementation of the A Line changes on April 22, 2016.

Bruce Abel asked Jessie Carter to walk through the process staff had gone through to get to this point because it has been quite a process.  He said he would also like Jeff Dunning to highlight the proposed service changes.  He stated that despite some assertions made by the Montbello Organizing Committee, staff firmly believes that the recommended service plan offers improvements to service in Montbello and Green Valley Ranch.

Jessie Carter reminded the Board that the preliminary service plan for the A and R Lines was developed in July of 2015.  He shared that stakeholder meetings were held between July and August.  At the August 11, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee staff presented the service plan to the Board before taking it out for public comment.  He said between September and October there were eight public hearings.  He noted that there was also a great deal of written feedback.  He explained that those meetings and feedback have been incorporated into the final service plan before the Board today.

Jeff Dunning commented that some of the changes to the service plan since it was first presented to the Board are noticeable.  These changes include retention of Route 28 through the Whittier, North City Park and North Park Hill neighborhoods; the integration of Route 47 in Northern Montbello into Route 121, which will save many passengers a transfer; increases to Route 483 to have 30 minute peak period frequency; and revisions to Route 42 and 45 in Green Valley Ranch for better neighborhood coverage.

Jeff Dunning stated that the largest changes in the service plan involve the Montbello and Green Valley Ranch neighborhoods.  He noted that the Montbello Organizing Committee has been questioning how the new service will work.  He said that an explanation was provided to the Montbello Organizing Committee earlier in the day.  He explained that currently Montbello had 4 local routes running east/west that are spaced about ¼ and ½ mile apart.  He said that even in a dense urban area staff does not like to have routes any closer than ½ mile and in most suburban areas 1 mile apart.  He shared that what staff has found in Montbello is that the very southerly and very northerly routes do very well (Route 43 and 153); however, the two middle routes (Routes 44 and 45) are too close and are cannibalizing each other.  He shared that even without the changes for the A Line staff would probably propose discontinuing some of the service anyway.

Jeff Dunning explained that staff’s recommendation is to reduce the number of routes from 4 to 3.  In this proposal no one would be further than 1/3 mile from a route, which is a generally accepted industry walking distance standard.  He said that by combining the two middle routes staff can justify a higher frequency of service as well as expanded service hours.  He stated that Montbello will have a level of service that is provided in only a handful of neighborhoods in the rest of the District.

Michael Washington reminded the Board that any time there is a major service change, especially the opening of new fixed guideways, transit agencies are required to evaluate the changes for equity impacts.  He explained that the best way to evaluate equity is to look at the average number of local trips in the area and the minority and low income populations in that area.  He said that Montbello and Green Valley Ranch have a higher minority and low income population compared with the rest of the District.  He stated that as far as Title VI is concerned the proposed service plan is considered to be a proportionate impact and benefit to minority and low income populations.

Director Francone inquired if this service plan includes the November 3, 2015 request from Douglas County to increase service on Route 483 to every half hour.  Jessie Carter stated that the service plan had been updated to include 30 minute service frequencies on Route 483 during peak periods, which is consistent with their request.  Director Francone asked if ridership figures support this level of service.  Jessie Carter said that ridership figures support the level of service currently provided on that route, which is the service level that Douglas County is requesting RTD maintain.

Director Lubow shared how much respect she has for the staff that worked on this and Director Deadwyler for her involvement.  She said it seems like an enormous amount of time and effort went into creating increased transit and really good service levels in this area.  Nonetheless, she expressed how upsetting it is to receive letters from people feeling aggrieved.

Director Lubow remembers eliminating bus service as part of the W Line service plan and then having to reinstate some of that service due to public pressure.  She imagines that staff can distinguish this service plan from what happened on the W Line.  She asked staff to explain how the two are different.  Bruce Abel explained that the first difference came from lessons learned from the W Line opening.  He said the changes during the W Line were a classic example of textbook planning.  When a rail line is open textbook planning says that parallel bus service should be eliminated; however, in using that method of thinking staff did not see the disparity of fares that was created.  When that was brought to staff’s attention, staff made the recommendation to the Board to resume a higher level of bus service.  One of the lessons learned was that staff does not just look at the parallel service but also the impact on fares.

Bruce Abel shared that another aspect of this service plan is that staff tried to err on the side of conservatism.  If there were bus routes that were staff thought might not perform well but were borderline, staff left those routes in the plan.  He said that if ridership does not materialize those routes will be eliminated at some point in the future but there would be actual ridership data to support the elimination.

Bruce Abel pointed out that one of the issues staff has heard in the conversations with Montbello is the focus on going from 4 routes to 3.  He said the simple math tells the community that they are losing a route; however, the real issue is that there are too many routes in the area and therefore they are not getting a high level of service frequency on those routes because ridership does not support it.  He stated that by consolidating two of the routes RTD can provide service at a high frequency with a longer service day.

Jessie Carter noted that if the Board remembers back to 2012 RTD had to make a very large service cut, which was the same time staff was planning for the W Line.  He said that because of this, staff was very frugal in the bus service they were willing to invest in.  He believes RTD is in a different spot now.  He pointed out the Route AT and 169L, which do provide duplicative service but staff recommended keeping those routes when the trip time was considered.  He said if this was 2012 staff would not be making those recommendations.

Director Tobiassen expressed his appreciation for all the work done by staff and the public outreach.  He also appreciates staff’s recommendation to maintain the Route AT and 169L.  He believes there were good lessons learned during the W Line opening and is glad to see them implemented.  He shared that he met with the Heather Gardens Association last Thursday.  He said there was some grumbling about elimination of the 130H but believes it is generally being accepted.  He stated that he is very excited about the changes to Route 157.  He noted he met with Buckley Airforce Base and the security group is very happy to no longer have a bus coming through the 6th Avenue Gate.  Jessie Carter stated that he would meet with Director Tobiassen offline regarding the gate staff would like to use as staff thinks 6th Avenue may still be the better Gate.  Director Tobiassen noted Buckley Airforce Base would not be happy so it would be important to have a conversation to determine how to best meet everyone’s needs.

Director Tobiassen commented that the Route 483 frequency is a big plus for Aurora and Parker.  He thinks this is a very positive plan and looks forward to it moving forward.

Director Lasater thanked Director Francone for paying attention to Route 483.  He believes this is a huge step forward for Aurora and Parker.  He shared that he recently had a conversation with Bryce Matthews, Parker Comprehensive Planning Manager, about how pleased Parker is with the change.  He shared that Mr. Matthews also spoke very highly of the RTD staff.  Director Lasater acknowledged that Parker understands they need to bring awareness to this continued service.  He believes there is a huge opportunity for Parker to bring awareness to the people in Aurora of the work opportunities there are in Parker.  He hopes that over time this Route will mature and grow.

Director Solano said he received a letter from Commerce City Councilman Steve Douglas regarding a safety concern related to Route 104X and asked if staff had received it.  Jessie Carter stated that he had been contacted about the last Route 104X trip being cancelled but was not aware of a safety concern.  Director Solano indicated there was concern about moving a concrete bus pad.  Jessie Carter said he would look into it.

Director Anderson stated that she would be supporting the service plan.  She thinks staff has done an excellent job in balancing the old service with the new.  She believes staff is also flexible enough to make changes after the opening if they are needed.  She said it is imperative that the Board approve the service plan as April 22 is very soon.

Committee Vice-Chair Deadwyler noted that both Montbello and Green Valley Ranch are in her District.  She thinks she has given the staff more headaches than anyone.  She asked a lot of questions and said she is totally satisfied that the service plan should move forward.  She recognized that people do not like change because change is hard.  She said she does not expect everything to roll out smoothly; however, she knows that any issues will get worked out quickly.  She believes it would be wrong to delay anything.  Committee Vice-Chair Deadwyler shared that she has talked to many people who are so excited about the service plan because they can now catch the bus late at night.  She does not think the complaint of combining two routes is actually as big of an issue within the community as what the Board is hearing it is.  She thanked staff for being not only patient with the community but with her as well.

Committee Vice-Chair Deadwyler declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Authorization to purchase additional software maintenance and new software licenses for eFORCE

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO or his designee to amend an existing contract with IntelliChoice (Contract 10DH020) exercise up to two additional option years for software maintenance and to purchase new software licenses for the eFORCE Transit Fare Enforcement Software and Records Management Software.  The software maintenance is essential to maintain the existing software.  The new software licenses are needed to operate the software on a new hardware device.  This will increase the authorized amount by $600,000 from the current contract value of $884,300 to a total authorized amount of $1,484,300.

Motion:              Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 17, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bob Grado, Acting Transit Police Chief, explained that eFORCE is essentially the Air Traffic Control for all things security.  It is the current Records Management Software (RMS) with over 30K case reports being entered into the system annually.  The system is also used to report our statistics and information to other agencies.  He said that another component of the eFORCE system is the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system which is used for security officers, emergency medical services, etc.  Finally, the eFORCE system is integrated into the handheld mobile citation devices.

Bob Grado explained that since RTD will be purchasing new citation devices, staff is requesting to increase the eFORCE contract by $600K to purchase new software for the new devices as well as for ongoing software maintenance.  He stated that funding for this request has already been included in the 2015 and 2016 budget.  Additionally, another benefit is that the mobile citation devices will integrate between eFORCE and the Xerox fare enforcement software.

Director Folska asked for clarification if this software would integrate fare enforcement with our Smart Card technology.  Eric Farrington, IT Program Manager, reiterated that this would be for software for the new handheld fare enforcement devices as the current devices are no longer available.  The new devices will be an iPhone platform that will allow both the Xerox and eFORCE software to be on the device.  Director Folska asked if there would be an interface for these two softwares to communicate.  Eric Farrington stated that they do not interface today and will not in the future.  Having both pieces of software on the device allows for security officers to do the Xerox scan and then if someone is violating the officer can more over to eFORCE to write them a ticket.  Director Folska asked if staff anticipates requesting more money in the future to develop an interface.  Eric Farrington stated that is already budgeted for under another contract.

Director Menten shared that in talking with some of the security officers she has heard that they are extremely frustrated with the current system.  She wonders if there is a guestimate for how many people have not been issued a ticket for evading fare because of the difficulties with the system.  Bob Grado noted that was part of the reason we are moving to the new devices.  He explained that generally if there is a problem with the current handheld devices the evader will be issued a paper summons that is later entered into the system manually.  Director Menten asked if staff had surveyed the current security officers as to what they think is needed in the new system.  Bob Grado said that staff is very motivated to solve the security officers issues.  He shared that the new devices are being used at other agencies and staff thinks it will be a much more stable platform.

Director Francone asked for clarification as to the cost of the request.  She pointed out that in the recommended action language there is a request for $600K while in the financial impact section there is a funding amount of about $290K.  Eric Farrington explained that the $290K was for the software maintenance.  The additional funding beyond that is for the software licenses for the new iPhone handheld devices.

Director Anderson shared that her constituents are always very concerned about people riding without paying so she will be supporting this recommendation.

Director Hoy wondered if our security officers were currently supplied with RTD issued cell phones.  He explained that he was asking because he was assuming the new iPhone handheld devices would be functional iPhones.  Eric Farrington explained that they would not be functional for phone call, only for data.  The security officers would still be using their public safety radios.

Committee Vice-Chair Deadwyler declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

### C. Updates

There were no updates.

### D. Other Matters

Bruce Abel said he would like to take the opportunity to introduce Gina Callahan to the Board.  He acknowledged that many of the Board already knew her as she was currently the General Superintendent of Street Operations.  He shared that with Mike Gil’s retirement Gina has agreed to be the Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations.  He thanked Gina for her willingness to act in that capacity.  He believes Mr. Gil will continue to share his experience with RTD on a part time or adjunct basis over the next several weeks.  He recognized Mr. Gil for his service to RTD for many years and expressed that he certainly deserved his retirement.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Vice-Chair Deadwyler adjourned the meeting at 6:13 p.m.
