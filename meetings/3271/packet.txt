GM OVERSIGHT & PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Third Amendment to GM and CEO Employment

Committee Meeting Date:
July 8, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
July 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a Third Amendment to the CEO and GM Employment Agreement to
establish the annual performance appraisal and incentive compensation program for General Manager
and CEO Debra A. Johnson as set forth in the proposed amendment.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Vince Buzek, General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee (“GMOC”) Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board and Ms. Johnson entered into an employment agreement, dated September 29, 2020, which
provides that the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, will adopt a program by which the Board will
annually evaluate Ms. Johnson’s performance. The deadline for the Board to adopt the performance
evaluation program was originally March 9, 2021. Consistent with the anticipated RTD Strategic Plan
development timeline, in February 23, 2021, the Board adopted a First Amendment to the Agreement,
extending the deadline to no later than June 30, 2021. On June 29, 2021 the Board adopted a Second
Amendment further extending the deadline to July 30, 2021.
The Board and Ms. Debra A. Johnson are nearing the conclusion of the strategic planning process to
establish RTD’s mission, vision, values, and success outcomes, including key performance indicators.
The Strategic Plan will establish the objective Success Outcomes and subjective Organizational Values
as well as the goals and metrics the Board will use to evaluate Ms. Johnson on an annual basis
beginning in 2022.
DISCUSSION
The GMOC recommends that the Board adopt a third amendment to the Employment Agreement to
establish the annual performance appraisal and incentive compensation program for Ms. Johnson. Ms.
Johnson will have the opportunity to submit a Self-Evaluation to the Board prior to the issuance of any
final performance appraisal. For the performance period of November 9, 2020 through November 8,
2021, the Board will evaluate Ms. Johnson based upon the criteria set forth in the Job Description
approved by the Board in connection with the 2020 CEO and GM recruitment. For performance periods
beginning January 1, 2022, the annual performance appraisal score will be comprised of 50% objective
Success Outcomes and 50% subjective Organizational Values as adopted by the Board pursuant to the

Packet Pg. 17

1.C.1

Strategic Plan, including any amendments thereto. For performance periods beginning January 1, 2023,
Ms. Johnson shall be eligible for a compensation increase of 15% of the Adjusted Base Salary, of which
the distribution between base and incentive compensation may be adjusted by the Board annually. If
RTD exceeds the Strategic Plan Success Outcomes and Goals by 25%, Ms. Johnson shall receive an
additional 2% Over-Performance Goal incentive payment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact for this recommended action is reflected in the attached agreement and proposed
amendment.
