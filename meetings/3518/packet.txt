BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Sales and Use Tax Forecast

October 3, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fiscal Policy requires that:
RTD will contract with a qualified, independent third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts.
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model reports in March
and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s annual budget and six-year Mid-term
Financial Plan (MTFP). The provision of the Forecast Model Report is followed by a presentation to the
Board by CU Leeds.
DISCUSSION
The March 2023 sales and use tax forecast was included in the 2023 Amended Budget. The August
2023 sales and use tax forecast is included in the 2024-2029 MTFP and is also included in the 2024
Proposed Budget for which final Board approval will be sought on November 28, 2023.
The August 2023 Forecast Model Report reflects a projected increase from the March 2023 forecast in
RTD’s sales and use taxes as follows:

Integrity of
Model
Forecasts

Forecasts may be too high or too low, reflecting uncertainty in the
economy.
Forecasts are generated from theoretically sound economic relations,
modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern econometric time
series analysis.
BRD forecasts do not incorporate “add factors” or other subjective
adjustments of model forecasts.
BRD is independent from RTD with no political or financial stake in the
forecast numbers.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Executive Summary
High excess savings and growing employment and income have supported sustained growth in
consumption, and higher prices have driven up nominal retail sales, both contributing to record sales
and use tax revenue for RTD. RTD sales and use tax revenue grew 19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022.
RTD’s sales and use tax year-over-year decline in the second quarter of 2023 (-2.3%) was the largest
decline since Q4 of 2020.

RTD revenues are collected primarily within seven metropolitan counties (the “district”): Adams,
Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson, as well as a portion of Weld County.
Colorado and the Denver Metro region posted strong, above average economic growth following the
2007-2009 “Great Recession.” RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax growth
averaging 5.9% between 2010 and 2019. The pandemic recession created a drop in GDP, led to an
unprecedented decline in employment, and caused a sharp decrease in RTD revenue. The economy,
labor market, and RTD revenue all have recovered from the pandemic recession, but economic
conditions remain distorted, led by inflation and supply disruptions.
A model was developed to examine fundamental relationships between U.S. and Colorado economic
growth, and between Colorado and the district. It forecasts short-term, medium-term, and longterm RTD sales and use tax revenue, and accounts for economic and demographic (e.g., population
age) shifts over time.
Economic Update
•

•

•

The U.S. economy has proved resilient despite high (but improving) inflation and high
interest rates. GDP, employment, and income continue to growth. Inflation reported in the
Consumer Price Index slowed to 3.2% in July year-over-year.
Other economic conditions continue to indicate expansion: employment growth, wage
growth, personal income, consumption, and wholesale and retail sales. However, adjusting
for inflation, some metrics are recording negative growth.
Moody’s Analytics projects real (inflation-adjusted) GDP to increase 2% in 2023 and 1.3% in
2024 in the baseline scenario.

The personal savings rate spiked to record levels during the recession but fell to near-record
levels in 2022, and the level of excess savings is decreasing, especially in the lower two
income quartiles. With negative real wage growth and decreasing savings, sustained
consumption may come under pressure.
Nationally and locally, employment recovered to new record levels in 2023. As of July 2023,
Colorado employment recorded the 18th-best recovery from the recession. Colorado had
the 5th-highest labor force participation rate in the country in July and the 14th-fastest labor
force growth rate.

Short-Term Outlook

•
•

•
•

•

•
•
•

•
•

RTD sales and use tax revenue declined by 4.1% in 2020 due to the pandemic but rebounded
19.6% in 2021 to total $757 million, and grew 13% in 2022 to total $855 million. Revenue is
projected to increase 1.3% in 2023, impacted by sustained but slower consumption and
elevated inflation. Growth is projected to continue at 6.6% in 2024.
The Q1 and Q2 2023 revenue was squarely within the confidence bound presented in March
2023.
Combined 2023-2024 projected collections are 1.5% lower than projected in March.
Colorado employment is projected to increase 2.1% in 2023 and 1.2% in 2024. Heading into
2023, employment growth in Colorado outperformed most other states for roughly a decade
and a half helped by strong labor force growth and participation. However, published rates
of slower growth emerged early in 2023, suggesting Colorado’s economy may be
normalizing ahead of the rest of the country.
While the sources of personal income shifted during the pandemic, statewide total personal
income notched higher during the pandemic due to government assistance.
The national unemployment rate descended to 3.5% in July 2023, hovering at levels last
recorded in 1969 as the economy reached full employment and demonstrated tight labor
market conditions. The unemployment rate in Colorado was 2.9% in July 2023.
The forecasting model also provides information on uncertainty that is inherent in any
forecast through construction of confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The mean
forecast for 2023 of $867 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $838 million on
the low side and $895 million for the upper bound.
The mean forecast for 2024 is $923 million, with a lower bound of $852 million and an upper
bound of $993 million.
The 67% upper- and lower-bound estimates illustrate the broad uncertainty behind
economic conditions that pose upside opportunities and downside risks to the forecast.
Quarterly growth exhibits more volatility than annual growth, and use taxes are more
volatile than sales taxes. The third and fourth quarters tend to be the largest revenue
quarters for RTD.
Forecasts of national indicators that are used to drive state and district forecasts come from
Moody’s Analytics.
For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 75
times and below the actual revenue 94 times, and a simple average of the error has been 0.9%.

RTD Government Relations reported no pending or recently enacted legislation that would
have a direct impact on RTD sales and use tax collection as of August 25, 2023. Proposition
HH may have an indirect impact on RTD sales and use tax collections depending on the
impact on disposable personal income.
RTD sales tax collections underperformed state sales tax collections within the 7-county
region in April and May 2023 by 1.3% and 2.7%, respectively.

Modeling three economic scenarios helps to accommodate the broad uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. economy. These scenarios may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD
revenue growth over the medium-term period; the greatest variation in forecasts occurs
during the first three years.
Under the baseline scenario, RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 34.7%
between 2022 and 2029, reaching $1.15 billion by the end of the medium-term horizon.
A more optimistic scenario, under which the national economy experiences faster growth,
yields cumulative revenues 2.7% higher than the baseline scenario over the medium-term
horizon; however, the 2029 total is 3.3% above the baseline forecast.
A second alternative scenario in which the national economy experiences slower growth in
the near term yields a cumulative forecast 3.7% below the baseline scenario.
There are higher inflationary pressures caused by excess supply chain disruptions, household
savings, high commodity prices, and a sudden tightening of the labor market.
The medium-term forecast was virtually unchanged from the March 2023 forecast to the
August 2023 forecast.
Climate change is a direct assumption within the Moody’s Analytics scenario. According to
Moody’s, “The baseline forecast includes climate change assumptions that are consistent
with a weighted average of the assumptions underpinning a range of scenarios, including
those from the Network for Greening the Financial System.”

Long-Term Outlook
•

•
•

After revenue growth of 4.8% for the decade ending in 2020 (in current, nominal dollars),
revenue projections for the next three decades average 6.3% (2021–2030), 2.0% (2031–
2040), and 1.8% (2041–2050); the 30-year average is 3.3% (2021–2050).
Despite changes to the timing of the short-term revenue, the long-term forecast is nearly
unchanged from the March 2023 update to the September 2023 update.
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates population growth and shifts in the age
distribution of the population as key factors influencing the rate of growth in output,
employment, and sales.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Project Overview

The BRD collaborates with the RTD administration to forecast sales and use tax revenues, and to
identify the key drivers that will impact RTD’s tax revenue stream. Since project inception, the BRD
research team has been working closely with the RTD administration to better understand the
existing forecast system, to collect and organize relevant data, and to develop the three sets of
projections.
This report presents the revenue projections at the three forecast horizons, with some discussion of
the economic forces driving these forecasts. The model uses vector autoregression (VAR) techniques
in order to capture a mix of long-term, stable relationships, as well as short-term “deviations” from
these long-term trends. These relationships connect RTD tax revenue components to key
macroeconomic drivers, such as retail sales. The methodology is described in detail in the main body
of this report.
RTD revenue data is available through June 2023; state retail sales and state taxable sales are
available through May 2023; and District taxable sales are available through May 2023. Data after
these dates represent forecasts. Additional revenue from medical and retail marijuana sales are in
the RTD receipts. Adjustments to the model were necessary to accommodate the gap year (July 1,
2017–June 30, 2018) in retail marijuana collections caused by Senate Bill 17-267. As such, RTD
taxable sales in this report are based on RTD sales tax revenues excluding retail marijuana taxes.
Therefore, these data are actually RTD taxable sales excluding marijuana sales. However, the
forecasts reported for RTD sales tax revenues include the forecasts of RTD retail marijuana revenues.
This construction was necessary to produce a series without the discontinuity over the period from
July 2017 through June 2018 to produce reasonable revenue forecasts.
In 2016, revenue from Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses (i.e., ecommerce) became a
significant contributor to RTD’s sales tax revenue. Ecommerce accounted for more than 7% of the
total sales taxes collected in 2021.
Given the pandemic recession’s impact on specific sectors of the economy, the BRD began modeling
major components of RTD’s sales taxes (e.g., restaurants, auto sales, ecommerce, grocery, etc.).
Modeling the components of retail sales taxes produces forecasts that accommodate the volatility in
the subcomponents.
The methodology and model descriptions may be found in Appendix A.

In an effort to provide consistent and accurate RTD revenue forecasts, a new sales and use tax
forecasting system was commissioned in 2010. The Business Research Division (BRD) of the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder was contracted to develop a model for
projecting RTD revenues over the short term (2024), medium term (2029), and long term (2050).
This model has been regularly updated and fine-tuned to portray best-available revenue forecasts
that are specific to Colorado’s Front Range economy.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecasts: Short Term, Medium Term and Long Term
Short-Term Forecasts

All equations are estimated using monthly data to produce monthly forecasts that are aggregated
into quarterly or yearly data. Historical data for Colorado and national economic variables were
retrieved in August 2023, with much of the data current through mid-2023. RTD revenue data were
provided through June 2023, and state retail sales and taxable sales data were current through May
2023. All reported data after these dates are forecasts.
The short-term forecast relies on the Baseline Scenario from Moody’s Analytics. These national
macroeconomic indicators drive the forecasts of the Colorado economy.
Colorado Economy Forecasts
As background to the revenue forecasts, data on Colorado economic indicators are presented in
Table 1. Key indicators of Colorado economic activity show the rebound in 2021 and 2022, and the
forecast for 2023 and 2024. The unemployment rate averaged 5.5% in 2021, marking the beginning
of the shift to a tight labor market that drove unemployment rates down to 3% in 2022. The rate is
projected to remain tight at 3% in 2023 but increase to 3.9% in 2024 as the economy slows. Personal
income growth surged during the pandemic recession due to fiscal stimulus, and growth continued
in 2021 (8.7%) and 2022 (6.4%) as other sources of income rebounded (e.g., wage and salary income,
proprietor income). Moderate nominal income growth is projected in the short-term, but real
income growth will be comparatively lower due to inflation. Consumer price inflation peaked in 2022
and is projected to gravitate lower in 2023 and 2024.

Annual Tax Revenue Forecasts
The following table presents the expected changes in RTD base sales tax revenues and the driving
force behind these changes: taxable sales. From 2010 through 2019, district taxable sales recorded
10 consecutive years of growth averaging 6.1%. Taxable sales fell 3% in 2020 but increased 20% in
2021 and 13.7% in 2022. District taxable retail sales are projected to slow, increasing 1.9% in 2023
and 5.5% in 2024. Sales tax revenues change in stride, falling 2.6% in 2020, but rebounding 19.8% in

Summary: Following the Great Recession, RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax
growth averaging 5.9% (2010-2019). The pandemic-induced recession caused RTD sales and use tax
revenue to decline 4.1% in 2020, recording year-over-year losses for nine months in 2020. RTD posted
growth of 19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022, with projections of 1.3% growth in 2023 and an increase
of 6.6% in 2024.

2021 and 13.2% in 2022. Revenue is projected to increase 1.7% in 2023 and 5.5% in 2024. Note that
the model uses RTD sales tax revenue (less marijuana revenue) to impute taxable retail sales in the
seven-county RTD district because retail marijuana is no longer assessed at the 2.9% retail sales tax
rate for the state. However, retail marijuana is taxed 1% for the special districts, leading to a
difference in taxable sales and sales taxes.

The Short-Term Use Tax Revenue Forecast
In this model, use tax revenues are directly related to Colorado use tax collections reflecting the
broader geographical base for the use tax. Households and businesses residing within the district but
purchasing taxable goods outside the district are required to pay a use tax on these purchases at the
same rate as the sales tax. Illustrating the volatility, use tax revenues fell 1.1% in 2015, but increased
7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018 before falling 16% in 2019 and 20.4% in 2020. Use
taxes rebounded in 2021 and 2022, increasing 17% and 9.7%. The forecast calls for a pullback in
2023 (-4.3%) and growth in 2024 (22.6%). The volatility of use taxes is apparent in both annual and
quarterly data.

Upper- and Lower-Bound Estimates for Baseline Forecast
The previous tables present only medium-level forecasts, which should be interpreted as the mean
values within a range of probable outcomes. All forecasting exercises involve elements of
uncertainty, although information about possible forecast errors is seldom presented. Uncertainty
arises from the errors in equation specification and estimation, and from the forecasts of the
national variables that drive the state variables. Although information on the latter source of
uncertainty is not available, the probabilistic high and low forecast bounds that incorporate possible
errors in fitting the equations are presented. The values of the high and low forecast bounds are
computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval
between low and high forecast values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
The following table displays the 67% confidence bounds on total RTD revenues through 2023. The
wide 67% confidence interval reflects uncertainty. The possible range is as low as $838 million and as
high as $895 million for 2023. The 2023 lower and upper bounds range -3.3% to +3.3% relative to the
medium forecast. The confidence bound widens in 2024 with greater uncertainty. The 2024 upperand lower-bound estimates are -7.7% and +7.5% different than the medium baseline forecast,
showing greater uncertainty one year out. This shows that it is not impossible or unrealistic that
revenue could grow stronger over the next year relative to the medium forecast, as well as the
exposure to the downside risk posed by economic threats.

Medium-Term Forecasts
Summary: The BRD short-term forecasting model is extended to produce forecasts over the time
horizon through 2029. Using different assumptions about the future course of the national economy,
three alternative projections are derived from the same equation specifications. Under the baseline
scenario, which leverages the Baseline macroeconomic scenario from Moody’s Analytics, RTD total
tax revenues are projected to grow by 34.7% from the end of 2022 to 2029.

Two alternative scenarios produce variations in the short-term revenue forecast (1-3 years), but
growth rates generally converge in the medium term (7 years). An alternative scenario in which the
national economy experiences a stronger short-term growth pattern yields a 39.2% increase from
2022-2029. Under stronger economic conditions, this scenario out-produces the baseline scenario
nearly every year of the medium-term forecast. In the second alternative, in which the economy
grows more slowly in the short run, there is a 32.1% increase between 2022 and 2029, with slower
growth recorded in the first three years. The differences in the cumulative revenue from 2022 to 2029
illustrate the impact of slower and faster growth in the short run. The optimistic scenario produces
cumulative (2022-2029) revenue $193 million above the baseline scenario, and the pessimistic
scenario produces cumulative revenue $260 million below the baseline scenario. These alternative
scenarios allow for a reasonable degree of uncertainty about possible outcomes for the U.S. economy
and may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD revenue growth over the medium-term period.
The BRD short-term forecasting model is adapted to produce forecasts over the medium-term
horizon through 2029. This time frame has been chosen to conform to the RTD investment planning
horizon for FasTracks. The specifications of the equations for these medium-term forecasts are the
same as for the short-term model, and these are also estimated with monthly data.
Over any medium-term period, the U.S. economy can be subjected to shocks producing outcomes
that are difficult to anticipate. One reasonable way to present forecasts that incorporate the
uncertainty about future policy or unpredictable economic shocks is to develop results for
alternative scenarios. In addition to a baseline case, two alternative outcomes are presented: one
allowing for stronger growth than the selected baseline and the other assuming generally slower
economic growth. As an alternative method of incorporating uncertainty into the forecast, statisticsbased confidence bounds for the baseline scenario are also generated, producing high- and lowforecast bounds based on 67% confidence intervals.
Baseline Sales and Use Tax Revenue Forecasts
Moody’s “Baseline Forecast” represents a baseline estimate for the U.S. economy, constructed with
a 50% probability that the economy will perform better and a 50% probability that it will
underperform.
This scenario assumes that the economy continues to operate at full employment in the short-term.
Oil prices increase in the second half of the year. The bank failures that transpired in the first half of
2023 do not reflect a systemic problem in the financial system, thus do not pose a major threat to
the broader market or economy.
Climate change is embedded in the Moody’s scenario. According to Moody’s, “The baseline forecast
includes climate change assumptions that are consistent with a weighted average of the
assumptions underpinning a range of scenarios, including those from the Network for Greening the
Financial System.”
Real GDP is expected to grow 2% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024, and 2.3% in 2025. Inflation rose an 8% in
2022 and the CPI is projected to increase 4.1% in 2023 and 2.7% in 2024. The 10-year treasury yield
will average 4%, until it pulls back slightly in the second half of 2024. The U.S. dollar remains up from
its pre-pandemic level but has deprecated by 5% since its October peak.

Despite the recession, Colorado retail sales grew 4.9% in 2020 and 17% in 2021. Growth moderated
from 2021 to 2022, but remained strong (9.6%). Moderate growth is projected for 2023 (3%) and
2024 (3.7%); the simple average of 4.2% is projected for the medium-term forecast horizon. In the
medium-term forecast, state retail sales growth outperforms the nation many years of the forecast
period.
Colorado personal income growth is projected to increase 4.2% in 2023. The annual average
unemployment rate in 2023 improves to 3% for the year, and total employment grows 2.1%. The
employment rebound surpassed the prior peak in early 2022. With rebounding employment and
wages, elevated wealth and savings, as well as increased inflation, nominal retail sales continue to
advance.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In this baseline scenario, the mean forecast in the BRD model calls for a 34.7% increase in total RTD
revenues from 2022 to 2029. Allowing for uncertainty in the model estimation and equation errors,
67% confidence bounds can be estimated. These interval forecasts show a lower-bound increase of
19.5% in RTD revenues for the 2022−2029 forecast period and a 49.4% increase in the high-range
forecast.

As an alternative approach to incorporating economic uncertainty into the forecasts, the next
section describes two scenarios that examine the implications of potentially divergent shocks to the
national economy—one positive and one negative—for district taxable sales and RTD tax revenues.

Optimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 1 – Upside” represents an optimistic scenario constructed with a 10%
probability that the economy will perform better and a 90% probability that it will underperform.
Scenario 1 forecasts a rise in consumer sentiment with the strong labor market. Some global risks
dimmish in this scenario. Inflation rates continue to improve, but both inflation and interest rates
remain elevated due to the strong economy.
Real GDP grows 2.2% in 2023 and 3.2% in 2024. The unemployment rate improves to an average of
3.5% in 2023 and 3.1% in 2024. While retail sales remained strong in 2022, growth is expected to
slow in 2023.

In this optimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues reach $1.19 billion in 2029, which is 3.3% above
the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields revenue growth rates faster
than the baseline projections. Total revenues grow by 39.2% between 2022 and 2029. Cumulative

Pessimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 3 – Downside” is constructed with a 90% probability that the U.S.
economy will perform better and a 10% probability that it will underperform. This scenario assumes
that bank failures lead to reduced consumer confidence and tighter lending standards, and that
Congress briefly shuts down government later in 2023. In this scenario, high inflation leads to high
sustained interest rates. The global economy underperforms due to elevated tensions between
China and Taiwan and the persistence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leading to supply chain
issues.
The combination of these presumptions leads the U.S. economy into recession in Q4 2023, which
lasts for three quarters. The weakened economy leads to a rise in the unemployment rate. Real GDP
grows by 1.8% in 2023 and decreases 1.7% in 2024.

In this pessimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues reach $1.1 billion in 2029, which is 1.9% below
the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields revenue growth rates slower
than the baseline projections through 2025, then faster growth rates through 2029. Total revenues
grow by 32.1% between 2022 and 2029. Cumulative revenues from 2022-2029 are 3.7% below, or
$260.4 million lower than the baseline scenario.

Summary across the Three Scenarios
In the Baseline scenario, RTD revenue grows 34.7% to $1.15 billion in the medium term (through
2029). The pessimistic scenario presents slower growth early in the forecast horizon, followed by
faster growth, growing to $1.13 billion by 2029, netting 32.1% growth over the period. The
optimistic scenario records growth that results in an increase of 39.2% over the period, to $1.19
billion, outperforming growth early in the forecast horizon.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Long-Term Forecasts

Synopsis: Coming off a lower base for 2020 but a much stronger 2021 and 2022, the August 2023
long-term forecast reflects moderate growth in the first 10 years of the forecast horizon, slowing in
the final decade. Over the entire 30-year period, RTD’s total tax revenues in nominal (current dollar)
terms are projected to grow by 3.3% per year on average, while the real (inflation adjusted) growth
rate is 0.6%.
This forecast is for three decades: 2021–2030, 2031–2040, and 2041–2050.
National Economic and Demographic Trends
Growth in real output (GDP) is positively related to the proportion of the population that is upper
middle age (30–49 and 50–64) as this group contributes highly productive workers to the labor force
due to their experience and training. Although population shares change slowly, over the period
2010–2030 the proportion of the population in this productive age group is projected to decline,
from 46.2% in 2010 to 44% in 2030, contributing to a slowing rate of growth in real output between
now and 2030. The prime population proportion then increases to 45.3% by 2050. However, total
population growth rates slow throughout the 30-year forecast period, reducing real output growth
rates with each advancing decade.
Figure 3

In addition to a slowing of total U.S. population growth over the next three decades, the differing
growth rates of key age groups will have negative effects on economic growth. Growth rates of the
most productive age group (30–64), as well as the total population, will be slower during the coming
decades compared with the previous 10-year period (Table 22), producing some slowing in the rate
of growth in output. Across the three decades of the forecast period, growth in real GDP slows
considerably during the final decade compared with the periods from 2021–2030 and from 2031–

The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates age shares of the population as a key factor
influencing the rate of growth in real output and in state and district sales that determine RTD sales
and use tax revenues. This model projects annual growth rates in real RTD tax revenues to 2050.

2040. (See the BRD forecast in Table 23; the Moody’s projections are presented only for comparison
with the BRD forecasts and do not play a role in the long-term BRD projections of any real variables
after 2027.) Growth in the current decade was distorted by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, and the strong growth that should follow in the recovery (although from
a markedly lower 2020 base). The demographic drag dampens growth in the final two decades of the
forecast horizon, partially offsetting the positive influences of increases in productivity and human
and physical capital that account for the long-run trend in GDP growth. During the final 10 years, the
share of the productive age group stabilizes, but the total population growth rate continues to
decline. The net effect of these demographic changes is a further decline in the real GDP growth rate
into the final decade of the forecast.

The BRD’s projected rates of growth in real GDP are below the Moody’s growth during the next
three decades. Over the 30-year forecast period, the BRD model projects 1.1% average growth and
the Moody’s model projects 2.2% average growth. The BRD forecast of retail sales growth is below
Moody’s for the forecast horizon.
Growth in U.S. retail sales is driven first by growth in output, which is then moderated by
demographic forces. The BRD forecasts show sluggish growth in retail sales during the last two
decades of the forecast (Tables 23 and 24 report rates of growth in real, inflation-adjusted terms).

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Both Moody’s and BRD forecast modest growth rates in each of the three forward-looking decades.
Notably, retail sales grow at a slower pace than GDP.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy early in the current decade, growth
rebounded for retail sales and taxable sales at the state and district levels. Over the long term, the
national economic environment is reflected in the Colorado forecast. The combined influence of
national economic forces and changing demographics leaves the state and the district with quite low
rates of growth in sales and taxable sales during the final decade of the forecast as shown in the
following tables and figures.
Colorado retail sales growth over the next three decades is slightly higher than for the nation.
Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales also tend to outperform national retail sales growth,
primarily during the current decade. During the final two decades Colorado retail trade growth rates
match those for the US quite closely. Negative growth rates for RTD taxable sales during the final
two decades reflect the persistent slowdown in total population growth in Colorado, and especially
in the district.

Looking at nominal growth rates in RTD taxable sales shown in Table 25, the decade from 2021-2030
and the following decade are expected to produce growth of 6.3% and 1.9%, respectively. The
pattern of growth rates in Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales are both consistent with that
of retail sales growth, with average growth rates for the last decade of the forecast (1.7% for RTD)
being the weakest for all three sales variables. These rates of growth for nominal sales appear in the

Future RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted by multiplying the effective rate of taxation by the

those implied by the reinstatement of the vendor allowance, the rates of growth in RTD sales tax
revenues for 2016 and beyond are identical to those of district taxable sales. Since the use tax base
is not directly observable, it is still necessary to estimate an equation to forecast RTD use tax
revenues. In this equation, RTD use tax revenues are driven by Colorado use tax revenues and

Forecast Evaluation
Actual RTD sales and use tax data are now available through June 2023, allowing for error evaluation
through the second quarter of 2023. For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been
above the actual revenue 75 times and below the actual revenue 94 times, and a simple average of
the error has been -0.9%, with a 4.5% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue swings during
the pandemic recession). The March 2023 forecast for Q1 and Q2 2023 were high by 3% and 4.1%,
respectively, illustrating the slowdown in Colorado ahead of the national retail environment. The
2023 forecast was revised down in August 2023, but the short-term and medium-term forecasts
were nearly unchanged. The average 30-year forecast growth rate in nominal dollars ending in 2050
is unchanged from the March forecast.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Three models have been developed and estimated for forecasting RTD sales and use tax revenues at
the short term (2024), medium term (2029), and long term (2050). All three models consist of
dynamic equations that link RTD district retail sales and sales and use tax revenues to underlying
national and state economic indicators. Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive
the state and district forecasts come from Moody’s Analytics. Population projections that enter the
equations of the long-term model come from Moody’s Analytics and the Colorado Demography
Office. Colorado economy forecasts are derived from updated specifications of the Colorado
Economy Model.

Key Econometric Concepts
The equations of the RTD forecast model rely on modern techniques of econometric time series
analysis. Each equation specifies a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, capturing
both a long-run equilibrium relation and short-run dynamic adjustments toward this equilibrium.
Such equations are called error correction models (ECMs) and are a type of vector autoregression
(VAR) model. Following time series analysis traditions, these equations may embody complex
dynamic behavior that is based on rigorous examination of historical patterns in the data. Unlike
univariate (ARIMA) methods, which are sophisticated representations of trends and cycles, VAR
models include explanatory variables in each equation to allow persistent departures from trends
and possible turning points.
In the error correction model, a long-run equilibrium relation is joined with a short-run dynamic
adjustment mechanism. The long-run relation is called the cointegrating equation, which captures
the common trends in the variables of interest. For example, district taxable sales and state retail
sales are expected to move together as a result of common underlying economic processes; they are
therefore referred to as “cointegrated” variables. Naturally, one will observe short-run departures
from this common pattern, but with a tendency for one variable to adjust back toward the
equilibrium relation. For example, the district economy may lag behind changes in the Colorado
economy, but departures from the common trends governing these two variables will vanish within
several months. These dynamic adjustments back toward the equilibrium relation are captured by
the ECM.
This framework is illustrated with a simplified version of the relation between district taxable sales
(TXBLSALES_RTD) and retail sales of Colorado (TRDR_TTL).
DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD) = - 0.205*LOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.210*LOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) + 0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)) - 0.03745*@SEAS(1) + 0.040*@SEAS(5) 0.033*@SEAS(7) +4.125
Here DLOG( ) transforms any variable into its rate of change, so that the left hand side term is
interpreted as the rate of change in RTD taxable sales. Looking at the first two terms on the right
hand side, one sees that RTD taxable sales respond negatively to the level of taxable sales in the
previous period and positively to the previous period’s level of Colorado retail trade. These two

Appendix A: Models for the Three Forecast Horizons

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

A more complex adjustment back toward equilibrium is embodied in the following three terms on
the right hand side of the equation (- 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) +
0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)). Past rates of change in RTD taxable sales and current plus past changes
in Colorado retail trade also impact the rate of adjustment in RTD taxable sales in the current period.
Additional independent variables, such as the price of gasoline (- 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)), can also be included in error correction equations, and this specification also
contains three seasonal dummy variables and a constant term.
This particular specification of lags and differences is the result of experimenting with various
alternatives and selecting the equation that meets standard diagnostic criteria, such as uncorrelated
residuals and statistically significant coefficients. For example, it is natural to allow all 12 months to
enter into the equation as seasonal variables (the @SEAS( ) terms), but only 3 of these were found to
have statistically significant effects. Similar cointegrating equations and ECMs are developed for the
other key variables in the RTD forecast model.
Since the ECM is expressed in rates of change, this is the natural form in which the forecasts of
district taxable sales can be generated. Given historical and forecasted values of all right-hand side
variables, the ECM produces forecasts of district taxable sales based on the forecasted month-tomonth changes.
Econometrics explicitly allows for random errors in the equations and in the estimation of their
coefficients. These sources of error will be reflected in the model’s forecasts, and the resulting
uncertainty can be estimated through simulation methods. This uncertainty is presented in the form
of interval forecasts given by the model’s mean forecast plus and minus one standard deviation of
the forecast error. The upper and lower bounds of these 67% confidence interval forecasts provide
statistically based high and low forecasts for each time period within the forecast horizon.

Comparisons and Linkages between the Three Models
All three models are grounded in the cointegration and ECM methodology, and all three generate
statistically based interval forecasts of RTD sales and use tax revenues. The short-term and mediumterm models are estimated using monthly data and produce forecasts at that same frequency. These
monthly forecasts of sales and use tax revenues are then aggregated to quarterly series for the
short-term forecasts and to annual data for the medium term.
The specifications of individual equations in the short-term and medium-term models are the same,
and therefore the baseline forecasts over a one-year horizon are identical. Variables and forecasts in
these two models are expressed in nominal values.
In order to forecast district level variables (e.g., RTD taxable sales, use tax revenues), it is necessary
to model and forecast economic variables at the state level. The Colorado Economy Model
previously developed for OSPB provides the framework for predicting state economic variables, such

terms capture the error correction mechanism: if RTD taxable sales are too high relative to the level
of Colorado retail trade, then TXBLSALES_RTD will tend to decline in the following period. In this
situation the relation between RTD taxable sales and Colorado retail sales is out of equilibrium,
requiring future adjustments to restore equilibrium between these two cointegrated variables.

as Colorado retail trade and Colorado taxable sales. These key Colorado variables are driven by
corresponding national variables and related state series, such as personal income. The linkages
between the economic variables at the national, state, and district level are shown in the following
figure:
Figure 8

The primary drivers from the national economy are personal income, employment, and retail sales,
and these contribute to the determination of Colorado retail sales and, in turn, RTD taxable sales.
Given the effective rate of sales taxation, RTD sales tax revenues are then given by a simple algebraic
identity.
Recognizing that large shocks to the national economy are likely to occur at some time over the
seven-year forecast horizon, the possibility of such shocks is incorporated in the medium-term
forecast by the use of two alternative national economic scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. These
alternative scenarios allow for the possibility of faster economic growth in the near term in one case
and for slower long-term growth in the other. These scenarios also provide alternative bounds that
complement the statistically based lower-bound forecasts from the econometric model.
The long-term model equations are fundamentally different from those of the other models, and are
designed to capture gradual structural adjustments in the economy due to changing demographics.
This model relies on population projections from Moody’s Analytics and from the Colorado State
Demography Office to drive the forecasts of all real national economic variables, state and district
retail sales and taxable sales, and RTD sales and use tax revenues. Whereas Moody’s forecasts of
national economic indicators are used to drive the short-term and medium-term Colorado Economy
Model forecasts, BRD researchers have developed equations for key national variables for the longterm forecasts. Only Moody’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast is used for converting forecasts of
real variables into nominal values in the long-term forecasts.
Higher inflation could have an impact on the RTD forecast. Currently, the real-dollar RTD forecast is
constructed as nominal dollars adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For most of the previous
decade, the inflation rate has been low – between 0.5% and 2.0% annually.

However, market disruptions and supply-chain discord associated with current events create
additional risk of above trend and above target CPI. Year-over-year prices grew an average of 8% in
2022 but improved to 3.3% as of July 2023.

A combination of factors have continued to elevate inflation in the economy, some of which are
easing:
•

A disrupted supply chain that is imposing supply shortages and bottlenecks in final consumer
products as well as inputs to production. The Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to place
pressure on the global supply chain, while the reopening of China’s economy from COVID
lockdown is helping ease some supply pressures.

Excess savings by households remain above pre-pandemic levels, but higher costs of
borrowing, high inflation, and negative real wage growth causing consumers to spend down
savings and reduce savings rates.

•

Volatile commodity prices. Several staple commodities, such as oil, gasoline, lumber, and
wheat showed easing prices in late 2022 and early 2023, which should eventually be
reflected in consumer prices.

•

Tight labor markets. The economy swung from a very loose labor market during the
pandemic to one of the tightest labor markets in history. As labor markets have tightened,
wages have increased, but not to the extent to keep consumers on par with price increases.
Wage growth is considered to be the largest contributor to inflation. National and state
unemployment rates are lower than pre-pandemic levels, and many businesses face
difficulties finding qualified and willing workers, and this should place continued pressure on
employers to increase wages, especially for low wage workers.

The RTD forecast model currently incorporates annual U.S. inflation that rose to 8% in 2022, with
Denver metro area inflation at 5.2% in 2023 and 3.6% in 2024. The BRD team will continue to
monitor the situation and may adjust expected inflation when sufficient evidence emerges to
suggest changing inflation expectations.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The Input Data—Sources and Description

National Statistics and Forecasts: National data, such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. GDP figures, track
closely to state indicators. Typically, higher U.S. retail sales indicate higher retail sales in Colorado.
National statistics for GDP and retail sales are published frequently, and several forecasts for these
indicators are available. The Colorado Economy Model that drives the district level variables relies on
these national variables to forecast corresponding state variables.
Some key national indicators are:
•

U.S. Retail Sales: Obviously, this indicator tracks closely to Colorado’s retail sales. This
indicator, along with its forecasted levels, is a central part of the Colorado Economy Model
and the RTD district model.

•

The figure below shows the relationship between U.S. retail sales and Colorado retail sales
over the past two decades. The Colorado sales values are not seasonally adjusted (the U.S.
figures are), but the two series are clearly closely related. The data have been standardized
to show the common movement of the two variables. U.S. retail sales change direction at
the same time as Colorado retail trade. It can also be seen that, over time, the overall level
of trade trends diverge slightly for these two series. In 2000 through 2006, U.S. retail sales
were, for the most part, greater than Colorado sales, but from 2009 to 2020 the opposite
was true. This implies that U.S. retail sales were growing more slowly than Colorado sales
over the past 15 years.
Figure 10

•

National Income: U.S. GDP, personal income, and disposable income serve as common
indicators for the state of the national economy. U.S. GDP plays a key role in the long-term
model. U.S. personal income is a predictor of Colorado personal income, which enters into
the equation for Colorado retail trade.

•

Consumer Price Index and Components: In forecasting sales and use tax revenues, it is vital
to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable expenditures and to consider how the
composition of household expenditures changes over time. In the short run, the proportion

This section describes the data used to estimate equations and generate forecasts from the three
models. There are three levels of data: national variables, Colorado data, and district (RTD) data.

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

•

Population by Age: In the long-term model, the age distribution of the population plays an
important role in the forecasts of retail sales and taxable sales. For example, the rate of
growth in the prime working-age population of the United States is used in the equation for
national GDP. Population projections come from Moody’s Analytics.

Regional Economic Variables: The equations in the forecasting model are based on basic
relationships between corresponding variables at national, state, and district levels. National data,
such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. personal income, track closely to local indicators. While national
level retail trade sales are a reliable indicator of general trends in Colorado retail sales, the inclusion
of state-specific economic variables, such as Colorado personal income, can improve the explanatory
and forecasting power of the model.
•

Colorado and Denver Metro Personal Income: Total wages are obtained on a quarterly basis
by industry (or aggregated) and by county from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally
adjusted). This information is posted online with a six-month time lag in the Quarterly
Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Because the survey only asks for total wages disbursed for the quarter, and not for the
month, we cannot see an alternative method for obtaining monthly data by county. This
survey solicits information from the employer’s location, not from the employees’ residence,
so some wages leak out of the Denver Metro region. Personal income data for the state of
Colorado are sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a quarterly basis. (Data sources:
Bureau of Labor Statistics, www.bls.gov; Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.BEA.gov)

•

State and District Populations by Age Group: In the long-term model, retail sales and taxable
sales at state and local levels are affected by the age distribution of the relevant population.
Data on population by age groups come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s U.S. Population
Projections and Population Estimates, and the Colorado State Demography Office in the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

•

Colorado and Denver Metro Employment: Employment by industry and metropolitan area is
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) is a survey of
employers and is available monthly, with a one- to two-month lag. These numbers are
revised as the QCEW data become available. If county-level data are necessary, the QCEW
employment data are available, but lag six months.

•

Taxable and Total Retail Sales and Tax Revenue Data: The Colorado Department of Revenue
(DOR) is the primary source for taxable sales, sales tax revenues, and use tax revenues. From
the collection of sales tax revenues each month and the knowledge of the effective rate of
taxation, the department computes the value of taxable sales (revenues divided by the tax

of expenditures allocated to taxable items can vary with changes in the relative prices of
goods and services that are tax exempt. Gasoline prices are one example of a CPI
component that fluctuates dramatically, affecting the share of taxable/nontaxable retail
sales. This variable is included in the current specification of some equations in the
forecasting model. The CPI is also used to convert between nominal and real values of
personal income and retail sales.

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

We apply the same DOR data construction procedure to compute RTD taxable sales. Sales
tax revenues collected by RTD are divided by the RTD effective rate of taxation to produce
RTD taxable sales. In addition to providing consistency between the taxable sales and
revenues data, this procedure allows future changes in RTD tax rates to be incorporated
(e.g., anticipated changes in the vendor allowance).
In recent updates of the RTD revenue forecasts, the BRD team has modeled and forecast
specific components of sales tax revenues to improve the accuracy of total revenue
forecasts. This disaggregation of sales tax revenues became advisable during the recent
economic turmoil as various components moved in entirely different patterns during the
pandemic and into the recovery. Important examples of components that are now modeled
separately are online commerce sales, which were unusually strong during the pandemic,
and eating and drinking places sales, which dropped dramatically. These several components
of RTD taxable sales are driven by corresponding industry sales at the national and state
levels. The summation of the various components is now reported as total RTD sales tax
revenues.
The BRD Long-Term Forecast Model—Analytical Framework
Most long-term economic forecasting exercises employ a production function framework to project
real output (GDP). With this approach, output is a function of labor supply, capital stock, and
technology. From projections of these three determinants, predicting output is straightforward.
However, forecasting these three inputs is a daunting task that is often handled with arbitrary
assumptions about their long-run growth rates. There is little reason to believe that projections of
the growth rates in the three inputs would produce more reliable forecasts than directly projecting
output.
However, the BRD long-term forecasting model borrows some useful elements from this framework.
Modeling real output growth for the national economy is the starting point of the BRD forecasting
model, and all other variables in the BRD model are also expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
This puts aside the task of forecasting inflation, which depends on national political issues, Federal
Reserve behavior, and changes in global resource prices. Since inflation rates can be expected to
impact RTD revenues and costs symmetrically, incorporating inflation into the analysis is an
unnecessary complication.
Although the BRD model does not estimate a production function or make assumptions about the
long-run growth in inputs, a production relation implicitly underpins the framework. The growth in a
nation’s labor force, capital stock, and technology is affected by the age distribution of the
population. Substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the “demographic dividend”
establishes the impact that age distribution has on economic growth, working through the three

rate). At the state level, this procedure produces data on sales tax revenues and taxable
sales that are entirely consistent. However, the DOR computes taxable sales based on the
tax laws that apply to state sales tax collections, and these laws previously differed in their
treatment of RTD tax collections. In 2014, HB 13-1272 effectively changed the RTD base to
be the same as the state tax base.

Sound economic theory and empirical evidence supports the existence of a stable, predictive
relation between output and age structure. Output growth is positively related to the
working age share of the population, according to the aggregate production relation, and it
is negatively related to the dependency ratio, according to life cycle models of saving.
The age structure of the population is predictable with reasonable accuracy, and projections
are provided by the Social Security Administration and published by the Census Bureau.
Underlying demographic processes (fertility rates, mortality rates, immigration) change
slowly over time, allowing accurate age-specific population projections. Furthermore, older
portions of the age distribution of the population can be projected with great accuracy
because for the next 30 years, the population over the age of 30 depends only on mortality
rates and immigration—the former being highly predictable.
In terms of the production function framework, the age distribution can impact output
through each of the three inputs. By affecting the savings rate, age structure influences real
business investment and the growth in capital stock. One form of investment is in R&D,
which contributes to productivity growth. In addition, new physical investment embodies
latest technologies, thereby contributing to productivity growth. The labor force is obviously
directly related to the age structure through the size of the working age population. Also,
experienced workers tend to be more productive than new entrants to the labor force, so an
older workforce shows higher output per worker.
The ultimate goal is to forecast (taxable) retail sales, not output. Given the equivalence of
output and income, a simple consumption function links retail sales to output or,
equivalently, to gross national income. However, the relation between aggregate
consumption and aggregate income is expected to vary over time with changes in the age
structure of the population. Therefore, the equation for (national) retail sales includes the
population age shares, as well as aggregate income.
By the same reasoning, the age distribution affects the relation between total retail sales
(the model’s key national variable) and taxable sales (the relevant state and district
variables). For example, the consumption pattern of people 65 and older shows a higher
proportion of spending on nontaxable items compared with younger individuals who spend
more on taxable goods as they establish new households.

The BRD model employs this framework to produce long-term forecasts over the period ending
2050. Business cycle fluctuations come into play only during the current decade as the economy
gradually moves toward capacity output. These business cycle fluctuations play a role in the
medium-term forecasts previously developed for RTD, and the forecasts presented here build on
these 2022–2029 forecasts. The short-term and medium-term forecasts presented in the earlier

determinants of real output.1 The use of the age distribution of the population in forecasting longterm economic growth in general, and RTD tax revenues in particular, has several important
advantages:

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The equations of the long-term BRD model employ the same dynamic error correction/cointegration
framework as the short- and medium-term models. All variables in these equations are expressed in
real terms, and projected real variables from the equations are converted to nominal values using
Moody’s forecasted national CPI. Both real and nominal values are presented in the tables and
charts of this section.
National output growth is determined by population shares as indicated by the previous discussion.
National retail sales growth is driven by output growth, moderated by changes in age shares of the
population. State and district sales and taxable sales are similarly related to national and state sales,
as well as state and district population shares. State and district sales growth rates, in turn,
determine the growth in RTD sales and use tax revenues.
National retail sales and Colorado personal income are key factors driving Colorado retail sales in the
long-term forecasting model. But differences in population growth rates and age distribution for the
nation, the state, and the district affect the relations between sales at the three geographical levels.
The growth rate of Colorado’s working-age population, for example, affects personal income growth
in the state, which in turn feeds into the determination of Colorado retail sales. Slowing growth of
this prime working-age population therefore indirectly contributes to the declining growth in
Colorado retail sales, Colorado taxable sales, and therefore RTD taxable sales. On the other hand,
moderate growth in the total population of the state adds to the growth in Colorado taxable sales,
offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of changing population age shares on the other sales
and tax revenue variables.
Population forecasts are sourced from the Office of the Colorado State Demographer and from
Moody’s Analytics. Colorado population forecast revisions by age and by county were released in
late 2022, and showed slower net migration to the state and the district. An early indication from
the State Demography Office shows a downward revision to net migration for 2022 (note: new
Colorado and district population estimates and projections will be released in October 2023).
Overall, population growth in Colorado and in the district affects the growth in sales and therefore in
sales tax revenues. While total U.S. population growth declines steadily over the three decades of
the long-term forecast, the state and the district exhibit somewhat different patterns in expected
growth rates as shown in the following figure. The estimated population growth rate for the district
and for the state peaked in 2015, followed by a decade of rather flat growth rates, and then began a
long period of decline. If birth rates increase, or the state experiences stronger net immigration, the
trend may be altered somewhat.

sections of this report employ nominal (current dollar) values of all variables, while the long-term
analysis is based on real variables. Both real (inflation adjusted) and nominal forecasts of total RTD
revenues are presented in this section of the report to allow comparisons with other forecasts and
to permit either real or nominal budgetary analysis. The data presented through the end of 2022 are
historical observations, while data from 2023 to 2050 represent forecasts.

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In addition to variations in the rate of total population growth, the changing population age
structure also affects the growth rates of sales and tax revenues in the long-term projections. For
Colorado and the district, the proportion of those in the prime working-age group and those in the
youngest age group (0 to 29 years of age) are projected to decline throughout most of the forecast
period, while the share of the aging population will grow. These trends will adversely impact total
and taxable sales in the state and the district.

The following two figures further demonstrate changing demographics over time, modeled by the
old-age dependency ratio and the prime working-age ratio. These ratios target more precisely the
changing size of the retired and working populations as they affect income and retail sales.
The old-age dependency ratio increases throughout the forecast horizon, but Colorado and the
district remain below the national ratio.

Conversely, the primary working-age ratio for the district falls through 2030, with some leveling of
this decline between 2030 and 2045 followed by further decline to 2050.

Since budget planning more commonly employs nominal (current dollar) values, the inflationadjusted (real) forecasts are converted to current dollars using Moody’s Analytics annual forecasts of
the national CPI for urban households. This adjustment with the national CPI is consistent with the
conversions to real values used throughout the BRD long-term modeling project. Although local CPI
data are available, these may be less reliable than the national data due to smaller samples in the

Appendix C: A Qualitative Assessment of the Economy

Summary: The U.S. economy appears poised for a “soft landing” with slower GDP growth while
supporting further job growth. Colorado real GDP increased 1.5% year-over-year in Q2 2023, and at
an annualized rate of 1.9% from Q1 to Q2. National and Colorado employment continued to reach
new heights in 2023. However, elevated inflation and high interest rates pose headwinds.
Gross Domestic Product
When determining whether an economy is under a recession, factors considered include real
personal income less transfers, nonfarm payroll employment, employment as measured by the
household survey, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale-retail sales adjusted for price
changes, and industrial production. The recent pandemic recession was officially marked by the
National Bureau of Economic Research as the shortest U.S. recession (two months) dating back to
the mid-1800s when dating recessions began. National real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate (SAAR) of 2% in Q1 2023 and 2.4% in Q2 2023. Personal consumption expenditures
showed resiliency, increasing 4.2% and 1.6% in Q1 and Q2, respectively; and growth was recorded
among both goods and services. Gross private fixed investment rebounded in Q2, growing 5.7%;
however, residential fixed investment decreased for the 9th-consecutive quarter. Government
consumption grew at an annualized rate of 5% in the first quarter and 2.6% in the second quarter.
The trade deficit slightly improved. GDP is expected to increase in 2023 and 2024.
In Q1 2023 (newest available data), Colorado’s real GDP increased 1.5% year-over-year. Nationally,
Colorado ranked 24th in year-over-year growth.

This qualitative assessment of the U.S. and Colorado economies is intended to serve as context for
the RTD sales and use tax forecast. In the process of compiling an annual business and economic
outlook for Colorado, the BRD has developed local indicators that can be used to complement the
results from the econometric models.

Figure 19: Index of Consumer Confidence

Jobless Claims
National initial jobless claims totaled 230,000 the week of August 19, 2023. While this represents a
10.6% increase year-over-year, it represents a level 37% below the all-time average. Colorado’s
jobless claims have seen a slight jump in the beginning of 2023 over the prior years but have already
begun to settle. The 2,428 initial jobless claims filed the week ending August 12, 2023 were up 14.4%
year-over-year, but remained 25% below the all-time average. Continued claims in the state also
rose year-over-year and are also well-below the all-time average.

National consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, has generally been on the
rise since hitting a low point in July 2022. The index increased 6.9 points in July 2023 to the highest
level in two years. Concerns about inflation have begun to subside, as the prices of commodities
such as gas and electricity have become more stable. Inflation is still expected to grow more slowly
as the Federal Reserve continues to raise the federal funds rate. The strength in the job market and
continued economic growth, notably consumption, have eased concerns of a possible recession in
2023. Breaking with the normal trend, the Mountain Region decreased below the national index in
July. The Mountain Region index is generally more volatile than the national index.

Employment and Wages
U.S. job growth averaged 606,000 per month in 2001 and 399,000 in 2022 as the economy recouped
jobs lost from the pandemic recession, making it back to peak employment in June 2022. The U.S.
continued to add jobs in 2023, adding an average of 258,000 jobs per month. The pace of job growth
slowed in June and July, dropping below 200,000 each month (185,000 and 187,000, respectively)—
the slowest pace in nearly 2 ½ years.
Figure 21: United States Employment, Total Jobs

The national unemployment rate decreased from 4% in July 2022 to 3.4% in July 2023. The
unemployment rate in Colorado was 2.9% in July 2023, ranking the state with the 23rd-lowest
unemployment rate in the nation. The rate increased from 2.7% a year ago. Within the state, the
Fort Collins MSA had the lowest rate in July while the Pueblo MSA had the highest rate. The Denver
MSA’s unemployment rate was 3.4%.

Colorado added 114,000 jobs in 2022—the most jobs added in a single year in the state. The number
of jobs in Colorado totaled 2,864,900. The state is projected to add another 54,400 jobs in 2023, a
slower absolute number and rate of change.

By industry, the most jobs added are projected in Government, Leisure and Hospitality, and in
Professional and Business Services. By rate of change, the fastest pace of growth is projected in
Mining and Logging and in Government. Financial Activities and Manufacturing are both projected to
lose jobs in 2023. Wages in Colorado’s private sector grew 5% year-over-year in July 2023, ranking
26th nationally.

There have also been continued struggles to fill record numbers of job openings. While job openings
have generally decreased over the past year, they remain high, totalling over 9.6 million openings in
June 2023, a year-over-year decrease of 12.6%, but an increase of 34.2% over June 2019 numbers.
The number of quits, while also going down throughout 2022, also remains at high with nearly 3.8
million in June 2023. This represents a year-over-year decrease of 9.3% and an increase of 8% over

still remain 260,000 below October 2019 levels.

Colorado’s job openings rate of 6.1% ranked the state 19th in June. The state reportedly had
190,000 job openings and 91,706 unemployed individuals, resulting in a ratio of 2.1 job openings per
unemployed person in the state.

Real Estate
Residential real estate prices in Colorado continued to grow in Q1 2023. The most recent data from
the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) All Transactions Index show that home prices in
Colorado increased 4.8% year-over-year in Q1 2023, and 0.2% quarter-over-year.

The total value of construction is determined when permits are pulled rather than when activity is
put into place. Colorado’s value of construction decreased 19.8% during the first half of 2023
compared to the same period in 2022. The greatest decrease was recorded in the residential sector.
Nonresidential also recorded a decline while nonbuilding (infrastructure) increased.

Colorado residential permits decreased 13.3% in 2022, with single family residential decreasing more
than multifamily. Through June 2023, residential permits decreased further compared to the same
period in 2022, down 24.6%.

Inflation
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) – All Items increased
3.2% in July 2023 year-over-year. Core inflation, which includes all items less food and energy,
increased 4.7% year-over-year. Denver-Aurora-Lakewood recorded slightly higher price growth
(4.7% all items, 5.8% core) as the region recorded notably higher housing and transportation price
growth.

Retail Sales
Monthly national retail and food services sales growth averaged 9.8% year-over-year in 2022. The
rate slowed to 3.3% in 2023 according to Census data through June; June alone was up 3.1% yearover year. Food services and drinking places recorded the strongest growth while gasoline stations
recorded the strongest decline year-over-year.

Colorado retail and food services sales increased 3.9% year-to-date in 2023 through May. Colorado’s
sales and use tax collections increased 14% in 2022, but collections growth slowed to 3.8% in the
first half of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.
Comparing taxable retail sales for the first five months of 2023 to the same period in 2022, state
taxable sales increased 2.8%. Comparatively, taxable sales were up 3.6% in the RTD district area;
however, growth slowed as the year progressed with growth averaging 6.4% in the first three
months of 2023 and growth averaging -0.1% in April and May.

E-Commerce
E-commerce sales continue to expand at a relatively rapid rate. As technology advances through
tablets and mobile devices, consumers have greater ability to make digital purchases and access the
nation’s e-commerce landscape. While the COVID-19 pandemic caused a short-term spike in ecommerce activity, there has been a notable long-term adoption of the sales channel that pre-dates
the pandemic. E-commerce now represents $1 in every $6.50 of retail activity. The growth rate
slowed to under 10% for 6 of the last 8 quarters.

Appendix D: Prolonged Recession Scenario

Real GDP grows 1.8% in 2023 and falls 2.8% in 2024 and 0.3% in 2025; the medium-term average is
1.6%. The unemployment rate increases to an average of 7.8% in 2024 and 8.7% in 2025. Retail sales
slow in 2023 and fall 6.4% in 2024 before returning to moderate growth.
In this recession scenario, RTD revenue grows very slowly in 2023 (0.4%) and fall in 2024 (-1.3).
However, RTD revenue begins posting growth again in 2025, ranging between 2.3% and 6.8% in the
medium-term horizon.

In response to a request by RTD staff, the BRD research team added a fourth scenario modeling the
impact of a prolonged recession. The team leveraged a U.S. macroeconomic scenario titled, “S4:
Alternative Scenario 4 – Downside – 96% Percentile”, which is constructed with a 96% probability
that the economy will outperform this projection and a 4% probability that the economy will
underperform. Economic growth is slowed by tight financial conditions, the risk of a government
shutdown, elevated interest rates, and persistent supply chain disruptions caused in part by Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine and increased tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Amendment to Salaried Employees' Defined Contribution
Plan

October 3, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 24, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a third amendment to the Salaried Employees’ Defined
Contribution Plan to change the vesting schedule to 20% vesting at one year of employment, and an
additional 20% at each year of employment thereafter, with 100% vesting at five years.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Non-represented employees hired before January 1, 2008, participate in a defined benefit pension plan.
This pension plan was closed to new non-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2008, who
instead participate in a defined contribution plan. The defined contribution plan qualifies as an Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) section 401(a) plan.
This defined contribution plan is funded by contributions from RTD of 9% of qualifying wages. The
current plan documents provide for a five-year cliff vesting, during which period employees do not vest
or own any portion of these contributions until they reach five years of continuous employment with
RTD. Therefore, if a non-represented employee terminates employment prior to reaching five years of
employment, all employer contributions are forfeited to the plan and used for administrative expenses.
IRS rules do not permit returning forfeited employer contributions to the employer.
The represented employee defined benefit pension plan was closed to new employees hired January 1,
2023, and thereafter and a defined contribution 401(a) plan is provided. This represented employee
defined contribution plan provides a vesting schedule of 20% for each full year of continuous
employment with RTD. Therefore, represented employees vest at 20% at one year of employment, 40%
at two years of employment, and so on until they reach 100% vesting at five years of employment.
DISCUSSION
The non-represented employee defined contribution plan trustees, including Directors Broom and Dishell,
recommend that the vesting schedule be changed from a five-year cliff vesting to a schedule wherein
employees vest at 20% at one year of full employment, and at an additional 20% each year of
employment thereafter, with 100% vesting at five years. This proposed schedule aligns with the
represented employee defined contribution plan vesting schedule and has been determined to be more

Packet Pg. 78

1.D.1

favorably viewed by employees than a five-year cliff vesting schedule. It may also contribute to RTD’s
ability to attract and retain talent by enhancing the total rewards benefit package. It thus aligns with the
Strategic Plan Success Outcomes of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
Should this recommendation be approved by the Board, the non-represented employee defined
contribution plan will be amended, and the Plan recordkeeper will enact the vesting changes effective
February 1, 2024. The new vesting schedule would apply to non-represented employees from that date,
and those hired on or after that date. For example, a current, active non-represented employee who has
reached three years of continuous employment will be vested at 60% at the time that the plan changes
are effective on February 1, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this recommended action. Changes to the vesting schedule
may result in lower forfeitures within the non-represented defined contribution plan; however, it is
estimated that these forfeitures will continue to be adequate to fund plan administrative expenses.

The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds, and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of
return. Although RTD must follow the investment parameters dictated by state law (§24-75-601.1,
C.R.S.), this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the Strategic Priority of Financial
Success.
Staff is recommending minor grammatical changes to the 2024 Investment Policy as shown in the
attached. No other changes are requested at this time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this action item.

2024 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such
securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in
the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio
may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25%

program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

more than 50% of the Portfolio.
6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

Packet Pg. 90

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy.doc (4827 : 2024 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

1.D.2.a

Subject: 2024 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

6.3 Portfolio Duration

1.D.2.a

Subject: 2024 Investment Policy
Page 9

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy, denoting
any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

2024 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Bboard-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity.

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating
category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and
Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is
downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio,
the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to
sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100%
of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities: Obligations, participations or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality or United States government-sponsored
enterprise as described in CRS 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such
securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating categories (as described above in
the Credit Criteria section) by at least two NRSROs. No more than 75% of the Portfolio
may be invested in Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities, with no more than 25%

more than 50% of the Portfolio.
6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy Red Line (4827 : 2024 Investment Policy)

No more than 50% of the Portfolio may be invested in repurchase agreements and no more
than 10% may be invested with a single counterparty. The maximum maturity for a
repurchase agreement shall be limited to 90 days.

6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,

1.D.2.b

Subject: 20243 Investment Policy
Page 8

the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.

The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and custody
With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.

Attachment: RTD 2023 Investment Policy Red Line (4827 : 2024 Investment Policy)

6.3 Portfolio Duration

For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns which
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this Policy
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation or
other financial securities issued by RTD.

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year staff presents for the Board’s consideration the proposed Fiscal Policy for the upcoming fiscal
year. The Fiscal Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October
2022 for the 2023 fiscal year.
DISCUSSION
Modifications to the Fiscal Policy for 2024 include the following:
•
•
•

•
•
•

Minor grammatical changes
Relocation of an existing reference to preparation of a Mid-term Financial Plan in the Capital
Improvement Policies section to the Budget Policies section
Clarification in the Fund Balance Policies section to allow for additional debt to fund the Transit
Asset Management (TAM) Plan in which:
o Doing so would be financially advantageous for cash flow purposes, or
o The investment returns on available funds exceeds the cost of debt
Relocation of the reference to maintaining a minimum net revenue coverage ratio from the Debt
Policies section to the Budget Policies section
Modification of the amended budget phrasing in the Budget Policies section in alignment with
RTD’s intent to no longer plan to complete an amended budget annually unless necessary
A change in terminology from a reference to the annual preparation of a six-year Mid-term
Financial Plan to that of a Five-year Financial Forecast. This change is being made to be more
descriptive of the financial planning process and changing from six-years to five years due to a
five-year forecast being in alignment with common industry practices. The financial forecast
terminology will be changed to the Five-year Financial Forecast from the Mid-term Financial Plan

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP)

October 3, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
October 24, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
BACKGROUND
The 2024-2029 MTFP is the six-year financial forecast used as the basis for the development of the
2024 Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning. The development of this forecast
seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding sources in alignment with
RTD’s Strategic Plan. Adoption of the 2024-2029 MTFP by the Board is not a commitment or
appropriation of funding.
DISCUSSION
The 2024-2029 MTFP projects that the agency’s forecasted revenues and reserves are sufficient to
meet expected operational, debt service and asset management expenditures while maintaining reserves
as required by the Board approved RTD Fiscal Policy. While RTD’s financial position is forecasted to
meet the Strategic Priority of Financial Success through 2029, vigilance will be required to ensure the
agency maintains activities within the projected fiscal constraints. The 2024-2029 MTFP was developed
in consideration of a prudent, fiscally sustainable approach including provisions such as restrained sales
and use tax growth projections resulting from Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) implications. The result of
this forecast is a presentation of a fiscally conservative plan that allows for agility and scalability over
the six-year period.
Beginning in FY 2024, RTD will pivot to a five-year mid-term planning cycle in alignment with common
public and private industry practices, leveraging a document that will be known as the Five-year
Financial Forecast.
2024-2029 MTFP Assumptions
• Fare revenue is based on current trends in ridership as well as the Systemwide Fare Study and
Equity Analysis provisions. Ridership is forecast to increase 9.7% in 2024 due to lower fares and
increase 2.0% annually thereafter. A modest fare increase is assumed in 2027 subject to
additional future discussions
• Sales and use tax projections provided in August 2023 by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business project a $31.7 million decrease over the March 2023 forecast. The decrease

Packet Pg. 122

1.D.4

•
•
•

is primarily due to weaker collections during 2023 and lower year-over-year growth due to
forecasted Base System growth capped at 1.4% after 2024 for TABOR limits. The 1.4% Base
System growth assumption matches the assumptions from Reimagine RTD in which growth was
capped at the growth rate of property taxes in alignment with TABOR revenue growth limits
Operating expenses increase at an annual rate of 5.1% over the six-year MTFP period due to
inflationary assumptions. Limited increases to headcount are assumed
Asset management expenditures are included that maintain assets in a state of good repair based
on current information
Reserves are projected to increase $202 million during the six-year MTFP to ensure that operating
reserves of three months expenses and a capital replacement fund are maintained as required by
fiscal policies

Current Outlook
• The 2024-2029 period balances funding sources and uses while maintaining reserves
• Service levels reflect the System Optimization Plan requirements
• Funding of full asset management backlog plus reserves for future needs
• Debt service coverage ratio policy of 1.2x is met each year
• Reserves of three months operating expenses met in each year
• Limited new projects are included
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2024-2029 MTFP projects balanced funding sources and uses while meeting asset management
needs and fiscal policy requirements for reserves and debt service coverage ratios.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Proposed Budget

October 3, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2024 Proposed Budget and associated attachments are included in this Board Discussion item and
will also be posted to the RTD website with hard copies available in the Board Office for public review.
Furthermore, notices of these postings will occur in the Denver Post and the Boulder Daily Camera as
required by §29-1-106(3)(a), C.R.S., to “be published one time in a newspaper having general circulation
in the local government.”
Pursuant to §29-1-105, C.R.S., RTD will have the 2024 Proposed Budget available for public review by
October 15, 2023, as well as provide a transparent appropriation process allowing for Board and public
input and comment. Staff will then present the 2024 Proposed Budget as an Action item for
consideration by the Board in November 2023, which will include a description of any changes since the
October 2023 Discussion presentation.
The 2024-2029 Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP) will be recommended for Board approval in October
2023. The MTFP informs the development and consideration of approval of the 2024 Proposed Budget.
DISCUSSION
The attached 2024 Proposed Budget document includes narratives describing the financial assumptions
and alignment with RTD’s Strategic Plan Priorities and Initiatives. In addition, tables, charts and
commentary are included for evaluation of the considerations included therein.
Staff has developed the 2024 Proposed Budget to conform with RTD’s Fiscal Policy directives while best
meeting the transit needs of its customers and communities at large.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2024 Proposed Budget aligns expenditures with anticipated funding sources resulting in a balanced
budget while solidifying RTD’s financial position. RTD’s internal controls and budget appropriation
process provide those charged with leadership and governance responsibilities the opportunity to adjust
and realign appropriations throughout the fiscal year as necessary.

MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER AND CEO
October 2023

The FY 2024 Budget represents the agency’s financial
plan for the forthcoming year. In adopting this budget
framework in alignment with the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan, the agency demonstrates its ongoing
commitment to the Strategic Priorities of Community
Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and
Financial Success. With this commitment also comes a
renewed collective focus on three primary initiatives:
Back to Basics, People Power, and Welcoming Transit
Environment.
•

Back to Basics: RTD strives to enhance the
reach and impact of internal
communications and to redouble agency
efforts to maintain assets in a state of good
repair leveraging sound asset management
principles

•

People Power: Recognizing the critical
importance of its people, the agency’s most
important resource, in achieving the
agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously
address impediments to recruitment and
retention efforts and to foster a culture of
learning and development

•

Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks
to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors
and Code of Conduct violations on agency
services and workplaces and, in doing so, to
improve community and employee
perception of personal and public security
on RTD property and vehicles

Through the efforts of the Finance Team, agency
executives, senior managers, and subject matter
experts, these three initiatives are reflected throughout
the 2024 Proposed Budget and have been interwoven
into work plans created by employees throughout the
agency. By focusing on these important factors, RTD
Regional Transportation District
2024 PROPOSED BUDGET

can continue to strive to achieve
meaningful progress toward
established success outcomes.
In keeping with these success
outcomes, RTD continues to
adapt to accommodate the
ever-evolving transit needs of
customers and communities
throughout the agency’s 2,342
square mile footprint.

Debra A. Johnson

In Q1 2024, RTD will implement large-scale changes to
the agency’s fare structure as contemplated by
recommendations culminating from the Systemwide
Fare Study and Equity Analysis (Study) conducted in
2022 and 2023. When RTD launched the Study in April
2022, it embarked on the most comprehensive and
holistic review of fares the agency had taken in its 50plus year history. In response to customer feedback
regarding the cost and complexity of fares, the Study
was predicated upon the overarching goals of creating
a fare structure that is simpler, more equitable,
more affordable. The fare structure for 2024 and
beyond mirrors those laudable goals.
Under the new, simpler fare structure, not only will
full-fare paying customers be asked to pay less for
fares across the board, existing discounts for eligible
individuals will be increased, truly enhancing the
overall affordability and accessibility of public transit
throughout the Denver metro area.
Moreover, the agency is offering all of its transit
services at no cost to those 19 years of age or younger
commencing in September 2023 and continuing
through August 31, 2024; further, the agency is
seeking additional legislative support to continue
offering this program for years to come.

Attachment: Proposed Budget (2024) - October 2023 [Revision 1] (4837 : 2024 Proposed Budget)

I am pleased to introduce RTD’s Fiscal Year 2024
budget.

As contemplated in the System Optimization Plan
approved by the Board in 2022, RTD continues to
deploy transit service commensurate with the agency’s

All those within RTD’s established boundaries,
including visitors traveling to the region, have a vested
interest in RTD’s ongoing success. Even those who
have never stepped foot on one of the agency’s
revenue vehicles reap the rewards of a robust, reliable,
accessible transit system by way of benefits that
include cleaner air, lower congestion, and dependable
mobility options should the need arise. In fulfilling the
myriad of needs of customers and communities
throughout the region, RTD is truly fulfilling its mission
of making lives better through connections.
Of course, none of this would be possible without the
efforts of those steadfast employees who work
tirelessly to make transit service delivery possible. I
acknowledge and appreciate the collaborative efforts of
all RTD employees, as well as the efforts of the Board
of Directors and the agency’s union and contractor
partners.

Regional Transportation District

I once again extend my sincere thanks and
appreciation for the contributions in the timely
preparation of the FY 2024 Budget to Doug MacLeod,
Chief Financial Officer; Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager,
Budget; Heidi Wagner, Senior Manager, Finance; the
Budget Analysts, and the members of the Leadership
Team.
And lastly, I would be remiss not to thank the
customers, communities, stakeholders, and partners
who engage with RTD every day.
On behalf of RTD, I truly appreciate the opportunity to
lead this team of dedicated individuals as the agency
strives to be the trusted leader in mobility,

delivering excellence and value to our
customers and community.
Sincerely,

INTRODUCTION

This Budget demonstrates RTD’s financial capacity to address, based on current information, the agency’s strategic
priorities in the near term. The development of the Budget is a cross-departmental collaborative effort; hence the
proposed budget for the Board’s consideration is a collective staff recommendation.
For FY2024, the operating expense budget is $856.2M and new capital is $32.4M for a total budget of $888.6M.
Carry forward of capital and expenses will be included in the final proposed budget.

Regional Transportation District
2024 PROPOSED BUDGET

Attachment: Proposed Budget (2024) - October 2023 [Revision 1] (4837 : 2024 Proposed Budget)

The Regional Transportation District’s 2024 Proposed Budget (Budget) represents the expected revenues,
expenditures and financial position anticipated for the fiscal year January 1 through December 31, 2024. The RTD
Board of Directors appropriates funding by fiscal year that allows the agency to continue its mission to make lives
better through connections. The expenditures set forth herein align the Budget with RTD’s Strategic Plan Priorities
and prioritized objectives within the projected financial constraints.

Packet Pg. 142

PERSPECTIVE
The 2024 Proposed Budget focuses on the Strategic
Priorities of the Board-approved 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan. As a result, funding appropriations are aligned in
a manner to direct efforts towards achieving the
desired success outcomes as measured by specific
metrics.
The 2024 Proposed Budget operating expenses have
been developed in accordance with the System
Optimization Plan (SOP) approved by the Board. Other
significant expenditures for debt service and capital
expenditures are also included in this proposed budget
which have been developed utilizing RTD’s debt
service schedules, capital needs identified through the
Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan as well as
capital projects previously approved by the Board for
appropriation that have not been fully completed
(capital carryforward). The TAM Plan continues to be
evaluated, adjusted, and prioritized to address the
agency’s needs to maintain assets in a state of good
repair.
While RTD’s current financial position is strong and
funding capacity is available to fund initiatives and
programs within the Strategic Priorities and Initiatives,
it is expected that the agency will continue to be
challenged with accessing adequate non-financial
resources as a result of the difficult labor market
environment, supply chain issues and high inflation.
Economic conditions indicate that retail spending is
slowing and decreasing due to higher personal debt
levels, inflation and discontinuance of federal
government transfer payments that occurred for
Regional Transportation District
2024 PROPOSED BUDGET

economic incentives during the COVID-19 emergency.
Furthermore, the RTD 0.6% sales tax will be subject to
Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) revenue growth
limitations beginning in 2025. While economic
conditions in the Denver metro area remain better than
national averages as a result of low unemployment,
strong personal income growth and a diverse business
base, the agency is heavily reliant on sales and use
taxes, which can be adversely affected by changes in
personal spending behaviors.
Although challenging circumstances exist in the
economy, the agency expects to continue to benefit
from favorable short-term investment rates and low
long-term interest rates for borrowing. Historical
experience during economic slowdowns have also
contributed to more favorable labor market conditions
to improve hiring and retention. Finally, the agency is
well positioned with strong reserves to weather
negative impacts to sales and use taxes.
This Budget proposal sets a financial course that is
prudent and strategic while providing the foundation
for financial sustainability.
The agency will continue to uphold its responsibility of
good stewardship of taxpayer dollars while striving to
provide Community Value, Customer Excellence,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success. The 2024
Proposed Budget seeks to align expenditures with the
Strategic Priorities and Initiatives while maintaining a
conservative approach to revenue assumptions.

The Board will review and adopt the RTD Fiscal Policy

•

There shall be a budgetary monitoring system that charges expenditures against approved appropriations

•

The Budget shall be summarized for adoption purposes

•

Budget preparation shall follow Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)

A balanced budget is required in which revenues plus reserves are greater than or equal to expenditures

•

Procedures that postpone funding of necessary expenditures, such as preventive maintenance or equipment
replacement, will be avoided

•

Conservative revenue estimates that are reasonable shall be used

•

RTD will monitor the Budget and adjust as necessary

1.E.1.a

FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The financial aspects of a budget consist of three primary categories: revenues, expenditures and reserves.
Revenues and expenditures provide the cash inflows and outflows while reserves provide the financial balance to
smooth cash flow volatility and supply the financial relief necessary for unforeseen circumstances that inevitably
arise.

Revenue sources are generally either recurring or finite. RTD’s Fiscal Policy establishes that one-time revenues be
used for one-time expenditures while recurring revenues provide a sustainable source to fund ongoing needs.
Because one-time revenues have a finite term, commitments for recurring expenditures require an alternative
source once the one-time revenues are exhausted.
RTD’s sources of recurring revenue, in descending order of size, are sales and use taxes, fares, federal operating
grants and miscellaneous revenue from advertising, investment income and rent. Historically, RTD has also been
the recipient of one-time revenues from federal capital grants, federal COVID-19 relief funding, local contributions,
and land sales. RTD does not budget or forecast one-time revenues unless certainty exists.
Revenue assumptions for the Budget include the following:
•

Fare revenue has been adjusted downward to $64 million in anticipation of impacts from implementing
initiatives culminating from the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis. These impacts are expected to
result in the fare recovery ratio (fare revenue vs. operating expenses) to only be approximately 5%. The
decrease in fare rates, simplification of fares, zero fares for youth and increase of the LiVE Program
discounts are the primary factors related to decreased fares. However, the overall financial impact to the
agency is relatively small, with fares having previously decreased as a percentage of total revenues during
the COVID-19 pandemic.

•

Sales and use tax projections were provided by the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business (CU
Leeds) in August 2023. The CU Leeds forecast model predicts that tax collections will be lower in 2024 by a
modest amount compared to the March 2023 forecast. The lower forecast for 2024 resulted from a
slowdown in year-over-year growth in actual tax collections during 2023. Significant tax growth in the
preceding three years combined with federal COVID-19 grant relief funding has resulted in strong growth in
reserves and significantly higher investment returns. The RTD forecast aligns with the statewide
expectations from the Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) and Office of State Budgeting and Planning
(OSPB).

•

Operating grants of $211.4 million are anticipated in 2024. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
increased the annual FTA preventive maintenance formula grants to RTD by approximately 30%.
Additionally, the federal COVID-19 relief grants, which were fully drawn in May 2023, resulted in a delay in
drawing preventive maintenance grant funding due to additional expenditures needed. Therefore, the
agency intends to accelerate drawing of these apportionments in the coming fiscal year. The grant
apportionments are based upon financial and statistical data that RTD submits to the National Transit
Database (NTD).

•

COVID-19 relief grants were fully drawn in 2023. This additional grant funding combined with strong sales
and use taxes has contributed to an unprecedented balance of over $1 billion in cash and investments as

well as substantial reserves, which, along with higher interest rates, will generate additional investment
income in 2024. These significant cash and investment balances are earmarked for state of good repair
needs and maintaining fund balances in accordance with the RTD Fiscal Policy.

Bonds (BAB) interest rate subsidy and advertising revenues.

Expenditures
Expenditures consist of both recurring expenses, such as operating expenses, as well as occasional outlays such as
projects, debt service and capital expenditures.

RTD also has a significant debt burden primarily from capital expansion projects as well as obligations issued to
finance the purchase of rolling stock. RTD completed two refinancings in 2023 to realize interest savings and reduce
the debt burden. As interest rates have risen recently, RTD does not anticipate performing additional refinancings in
2024.

RTD has ongoing asset management needs that are informed by the TAM Plan and requests for new
initiatives. Asset management needs can fluctuate significantly by year when, for example, a single year
includes a large purchase such as fleet replacements. There are no significant fleet replacements contemplated
in 2024, however, design and pricing are being developed for certain rail component renewals and
replacements as some portions of track are reaching the 30-year mark. Because these repair and replacement
activities are still being planned for 2024, only relatively small amounts have been requested for appropriation
with the intent of staff to return to the Board with additional appropriation requests at a later time, once the
project scope is completed. Staff intends to continue to fund capital needs with cash on hand in the Capital
Replacement Reserve. However, analyses will continue to be performed to ensure that the most financially
advantageous asset management funding mechanisms are pursued, given that investment return rates
currently exceed borrowing rates.
Operating expenses include an average of 5.1% increases due to inflationary pressures and supply chain
constraints remain a concern, particularly with certain materials. RTD has taken steps to accelerate certain
large purchases and also to allow for additional lead times in order to lock-in prices.
Expenditure assumptions for the Budget include:
•

Salaries and wages assume full staffing to provide service levels in accordance with the System
Optimization Plan (SOP). While it is anticipated that continued high employment and a competitive job
market will prolong RTD’s ability to attract and maintain full staffing levels, funding has been made
available in these appropriations. In addition, the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) includes wage
increases that have been included with provisions for incentive pay for represented employees until
such time that adequate staffing levels are achieved. The compensation increases in 2023 shown below
are primarily driven by annual increases and the addition of sworn RTD police officers, which the latter
increase is partially offset by the decrease in contracted security services included in Outside Services

•

Benefits include the following:
o

Attachment: Proposed Budget (2024) - October 2023 [Revision 1] (4837 : 2024 Proposed Budget)

RTD’s largest expenditures are providing transit-related operations. These costs include compensation, materials
and supplies, contracted services, insurance, utilities, and other such expenses.

A 2% increase for represented employee health and welfare benefit premiums. Larger prior
year premium increases resulting from many large claims, particularly those from claimants with
COVID-19 related complications, have subsided

Regional Transportation District
2024 PROPOSED BUDGET

12

Packet Pg. 148

•

o

A 10% increase for non-represented employee health benefits in 2024. In 2023, RTD improved
the pricing of the CIGNA plan to provide an affordable alternative to the Kaiser Permanente
plan as an enhancement to employee satisfaction. Shifts in participation between these two
plans occurred, which necessitated the 2024 increases

o

Dental and vision plans for employees remain largely unchanged for 2024, with certain
guaranteed pricing having been completed in 2023

o

Retirement plans for represented employees in 2024 include the same 2023 RTD contribution,
of 15% of wages to the defined benefit pension plan employee contributions remaining at 5%
per the CBA. This plan was closed to new entrants on January 1, 2023. In addition, provisions
have been included to fund the new defined contribution plan at 9% with up to a 5% match for
new employees having commenced January 1, 2023. The defined benefit pension plan is 76%
funded. As the number of active employees in the defined benefit pension plan continues to
decline due to retirements, future years may require a shift from a percentage of active wages
to a fixed annual amount based on actuarial recommended contributions in order to maintain an
adequate funding level

o

The non-represented employee defined benefit pension plan is funded with a $15 million
contribution in 2024, which is the same amount contributed in 2023. The actuarially
recommended contribution in 2024 is $11 million, and the additional $4 million is recommended
by the Trustees due to the availability of cash and the notion that funds contributed to this plan
earn a higher rate of return that RTD can achieve under the restrictions of the Investment
Policy. The additional contributions in 2024 reduce the long-term financial risk to RTD of future
inadequate funding. This plan is 79% funded and currently has 140 active participants. This
plan has been closed to new employees since January 1, 2008, and funding requirements will
tail off over the next several years

o

The non-represented employee defined contribution plan assumes RTD funding of 9% of
wages, which is the same amount contributed in 2022. Board policy is to contribute 7-9% of
wages each year. Only non-represented employees hired January 1, 2008, and thereafter
participate in this retirement plan. In October 2023, a recommendation to the Board was made
to change the five-year cliff vesting to 20% vesting for each full year of employment up to
100% at the end of the fifth year to bring the vesting in this plan into parity with the
represented defined contribution plan

o

RTD will continue to offer the 457(b) retirement plan to all employees. This is a voluntary plan
for which only employee contributions, and no RTD contributions, may be made, up to Internal
Revenue Service annual limits. RTD will continue to fund the administrative costs

Materials and supplies consist of consumable items such as fuel, fluids, and parts. Diesel fuel purchases
are typically contracted at a locked price for a certain number of gallons. RTD is currently assessing a
diesel fuel contract for 2024 but has not yet locked pricing. Contracting fuel purchases provides budget
certainty, particularly in the volatile fuel pricing environment. Diesel and gasoline expenses typically
account for 2% of operating expenses and the increases

•

Services consist of contracted specialty IT and legal needs as well as security. Additionally, these
expenses contain inflationary increases which are offset by reductions resulting in a $32.7 million
decrease in 2024. The majority of the decrease is due efforts to budget more accurately for execution
based on personnel constraints as well as a reduction in contracted security needs, which are offset by
the increase in the sworn police force

•

Insurance costs are expected to increase modestly due to premium increases and certain
enhancements to coverages to manage financial risks to the agency. Insurance costs have been
relatively flat over an extended period due to effective claims management

•

Other expenses primarily contain expenditures for utilities and purchased transportation and, to a
lesser degree, various minor business expenses

•

o

Utilities include projected amounts for traction power commensurate with planned rail service
levels and in alignment with 2023 usage, with a slight increase due to current rates

o

Purchased transportation includes contractual increases and are aligned with expected revenue
service hours. The contractual increases in 2024 reflect fixed-route bus and paratransit contract
amendments as well as a larger service availability payment to the Eagle P3 concessionaire for
single year asset maintenance need contemplated in the Concessionaire Agreement

o

Travel and training budgets have been maintained at the same levels as 2023, with the intent
to contribute to employee learning and development and transportation-related industry
participation

o

Funding for an on-call contract is included to address specialty consulting engagements, if
necessary

o

A budget of $250,000 is available for employee engagement to be used for outreach and
recognition programs. All other discretionary spending will continue to be limited

Debt service represents a significant portion of RTD’s annual expenditures. Debt service consists of
principal and interest payments on bonds, certificates of participation (COPs) and lease-purchase
agreements. Debt service payments for 2024 will total $223.3 million, down from $225.8 million in
2023 as a result of refinancings for interest savings. The Base System bond payments will expire in
2024, at which point, the Base System will be subject to TABOR restrictions.
