Special Recognition-Departing Board Members

First Vice Chair Director Tayer introduced the historical video from 2004-2012 that captured both the history and also commemorated some of the main accomplishments during the period that Chair Kemp and Director McMullen joined the Board.

Director Tayer acknowledged each of the retiring Board members and shared some enduring memories of what they stood for on the Board as well as some of the human side of these Directors:

- Director Barry Gore—appointed by the Adams County Commissioners in August, 2012 but in a short time was able to experience and provide input as an advocate for the North Corridor on the future of FasTracks. Barry is also an avid photographer.

- Director Jack O’Boyle—lauded as one who looks at the finances, Director O’Boyle was also the former Mayor of LoneTree who was instrumental in the approval of FasTracks in 2004.

- Director Matt Cohen—noted for his oratory abilities, Director Cohen demonstrated a passion and love for RTD, including his leadership during the construction and completion of the West Corridor Line.  Director Cohen is blessed with a great family that includes talented children and a loving wife who serves as the pillar.  Director Cohen is humbled to have had the pleasure of serving with such a great staff and Board.

- Director William McMullen—advocated for the rights of the union and represented their interest while focusing on what was in the best interest of the agency.  He will be remembered as the person who often made poignant points while discussing an issue at length.

- Chair Lee Kemp-has a true understanding of the political side of being a Board member and who galvanized the Board members around critical decisions to move RTD forward.  Chair Kemp was a mentor and friend who also showed a passionate side as a victim’s advocate for the City of Broomfield.  Chair Kemp is prideful of his wife and children who are in the process of have successfully completed their college programs.  Chair Kemp occupies the “Gideon Book of Records” as having been successfully elected as five-time Board Chair of an elected Board.  Chair Kemp expressed his thanks to the staff and the Board, noting in particular his appreciation to Directors Malpiede, Cohen, Bagley and Tayer.  He also stated that General Manager Washington is one of the best in the industry and he is honored to have served with him.  This was one of the greatest decisions by the Board to name Phil Washington as General Manager.

## V. Public Participation

- Lori Frasier representing the US 36 Commuting Solutions read a letter from this group.  A copy of that letter is included in the Board Packet on the portal.

- Gene Putnam expressed appreciation to the Board members leaving the Board and indicated that he has re-evaluated the proposed RAM and has a better understanding.  He provided a recommendation on taking one of the EMU vehicles that was approved for purchase and using it throughout the north to inspire and educate the constituents and the community.  This will help the community to envision what things will look like by touching, feeling and seeing what the future looks like for them.

- Lisha Burnett from Suncor spoke about the collaboration with RTD on the pipeline issues and that this has fostered an ongoing relationship that will benefit both Suncor and RTD.

- Former Director Chris Martinez expressed thanks to the departing members for their public service and commitment. He expressed there is life after RTD and a critical role that all of them can play is as ambassador in the communities serving as positive advocates for RTD. He thanked both Chair Kemp for his kind remarks and Director McMullen for listening to and taking the constituents point of view so they can have a voice on the Board.

- Doug Greg stated he was an older gentleman who was not always in good health.  He had gone out of his way to be here tonight to express the need to do something in the northern area sooner than later.  He has heard talks of pulling out of the District and he encouraged the Board to be creative and innovative in addressing the needs in the North.  He stated that although some of the things he is hearing make him fighting mad, he appreciates the work and effort of the Board.

### L. Moving Forward: Filling the FasTracks Internal Savings Account

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Any funding realized through these activities will be tracked separately and added to a new budget account, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). The status of the FISA will be reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly basis, and the FISA will be incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan and Annual Budget. Expenditures from the FISA will be subject to Board approval, with the staff recommended project goals identified below in the Background section of this report confirmed as the current RTD Board project goals for the FISA.

Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:

Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system operations at the rate of inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI):
- Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;

Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction milestones have been reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant funding has been received and RTD has better information on the growth of sales and use tax:
- Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;

Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from three to two months:
- Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;

Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation – complete once funding is identified for the entire project:
- Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;

Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under contract:
- Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;

Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
- Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;

Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current level of 2.5%:
- Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;

Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and provide RTD with parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure exemptions are the same for both RTD and the State in all cases). Establish this as RTD’s number one legislative priority. Begin working immediately with government relations staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to initiate and support the introduction of a bill(s) on these topics during the 2013 legislative session:
- Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the FasTracks capital program through the establishment of the FISA with a goal of achieving $300 million by 2017. It is anticipated that these eight highest priority opportunities alone could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million by 2017. The Board directs staff to continue working to identify other funding opportunities through the RAM analysis process in 2013 for potential Board consideration at a later date.

MOTION:                            Director McMullen made the motion to item K, Moving Forward: Filling the FasTracks Internal Savings Account.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

DISCUSSION:              Director McMullen stated how pleased he was to move the motion that will get FasTracks done sooner than later.  This is a sound plan and he hopes for unanimous consent.

Director O’Boyle stated he will support this action for the good of the whole organization.

Director Bagley stated he will support this motion.  He has had discussions with the staff and is pleased with the staff response in relation to item 4 of this proposal, defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad relocation.  He looks forward to the communications to the Southwest Corridor on the plans.

Director Cohen states he enthusiastically support this proposal.  When he first came to the Board his first action was an approval of approximately $8M item.  How pleased he is to be leaving having approved a $300M action item which is moving FasTracks in the right direction.  He thanked Phil and the staff for their confidence in the Board to make the right decision.

Director Gore also stated he supported this plan.  When he came on the Board five months ago, things for the north looked dismal.  He is amazed that in this short time, staff has come up with a proposal for generating $277M which can move the north forward.  He applauded the General Manager and staff for their fortitude and diligence in listening to the voice of the people.

Director Deadwyler stated that while this appears to be a good proposal, she remains concerned over the lack of a sunset or policy for rubber tires.  Therefore she will vote no for this action item.

Director Hoy stated he is very enthusiastic about this.  He feels this is a good step for the north and has now put people on speaking terms and willingness to re-engage.

Director Daly stated he was enthusiastic about this proposal.  This is a risk that is realistic.

Director Tayer expressed that he will support this proposal with the understanding that this program will not prioritize corridors who contribute over the 2.5% above the corridors that do not; and that cuts or changes to rubber tire services will not preclude BRT service.

Chair Kemp stated this has been a long time coming.  We must follow the money.  Getting the North line is essential to moving forward.

VOTE ON

THE

MOTION:              An electronic vote was taken with 13 votes in favor (Anderson, Bagley, Cohen, Daly, Hoy, James, Kemp, Malpiede, McMullen, O’Boyle, Tayer, Walker, Gore) and 1 against (Deadwyler).  Director Tobiassen was absent.

### M. Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements and Indemnification of Claims with Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt the attached resolution.  The resolution authorizes the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute two easement agreements with Suncor; one agreement that grants an easement to RTD for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”) project through Suncor property in Adams County (the “Bridge Easement”) and another agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a pipeline in the RTD owned Boulder Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”).  The Bridge Easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable, and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in an amount up to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that amount from the date of commencement of construction of the bridge and to maintain it through termination of the Bridge Easement.  RTD would receive $10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement, and would pay Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement.  This would result in net revenue of $9,163,580 to RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.

It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve for the acquisition of the Bridge Easement.  These funds would be replenished out of the $10,000,000 to be received from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement.

MOTION:              Director Anderson made the motion to approve the resolution regarding easement agreements and indemnification of claims with Suncor Energy.

Director Daly seconded the motion.

DISCUSSION:              Director Hoy indicated this was a good example of collaboration.
