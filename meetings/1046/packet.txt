Moving Forward: Filling the FasTracks Internal Savings Account

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the eight, highest value,
recommended opportunities identified as part of the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Any
funding realized through these activities will be tracked separately and added to a new
budget account, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). The status of the FISA
will be reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly basis, and the FISA will be
incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan and Annual Budget. Expenditures
from the FISA will be subject to Board approval, with the staff recommended project goals
identified below in the Background section of this report confirmed as the current RTD
Board project goals for the FISA.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:
1. Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system operations
at the rate of inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI):
 Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;

2. Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction
milestones have been reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant funding has
been received and RTD has better information on the growth of sales and use tax:
 Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;
3. Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from three to
two months:
 Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;
4. Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation –
complete once funding is identified for the entire project:
 Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;
5. Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under contract:
 Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;
6. Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
 Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;
7. Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current level of
2.5%:
 Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;
8. Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and provide
RTD with parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure exemptions are
the same for both RTD and the State in all cases). Establish this as RTD’s number
one legislative priority. Begin working immediately with government relations staff,
lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to initiate and support the
introduction of a bill(s) on these topics during the 2013 legislative session:
 Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.
Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the FasTracks
capital program through the establishment of the FISA with a goal of achieving $300
million by 2017. It is anticipated that these eight highest priority opportunities alone could
fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million by 2017. The Board directs staff to
continue working to identify other funding opportunities through the RAM analysis process
in 2013 for potential Board consideration at a later date.
M.
Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements and Indemnification of Claims with
Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopt the attached resolution. The resolution authorizes the General Manager
or his designee to negotiate and execute two easement agreements with Suncor; one
agreement that grants an easement to RTD for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”)
project through Suncor property in Adams County (the “Bridge Easement”) and another
agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a pipeline in the RTD owned
Boulder Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”). The Bridge
Easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable,
and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in

an amount up to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that amount
from the date of commencement of construction of the bridge and to maintain it
through termination of the Bridge Easement. RTD would receive $10,000,000 from
Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement, and would pay Suncor $836,420 for the
Bridge Easement. This would result in net revenue of $9,163,580 to RTD, which
would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility
(CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve for the acquisition of the Bridge Easement. These funds would be replenished
out of the $10,000,000 to be received from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline
Easement.

Others Present:

DUS Historic Building Update (Lien)
Marla Lien provided an update on the key items they have been negotiating with the Union
Station Alliance (USA). She mentioned that they will have an Executive Session next
month and then present to the Board and ask for their approval on November 20.
Among the issues discussed is the lease term which in the original RFP was set for 60
years. USA thinks it will be very important for lenders for it to be for 99 years. They are
asking for 60, 20 and 19 years to total the 99.
The initial use is for hotel, food, beverage, retail and transit. They are asking for the ability
to chase uses over the 99 years if the area/market/etc. changes. Staff’s recommendation
is that we agree to this with certain parameters allowing hotel, retail and commercial but
no residential use.
To address public and Board concerns about making sure that there is always access to
transit, and even though at this point there is no MOU with Amtrak, the design is including
the requirements for Amtrak to be able to have access to the platform and get luggage in
and out.
In the Great Hall they want to make sure that it is always available to the public and that
there is always food and beverages when transit is open. They will pick a standard like
Grand Central Station or Washington DC Union Station.
The appearance of the Great Hall is also another issue. The tenants will be able to design
their own rooms and lounges, while protecting the historic fabric of the building. For any
changes in the Great Hall they would have to come back to RTD.
They proposed to make the Great Hall available for special events and close up to 50% of
the Great Hall as long as there is access to transit and a seating area. They could host up
to 48 events a year.
Director Malpiede asked if they would use the entire Hall and have seating upstairs. Marla
responded that they have not determined how they will achieve that, but they will always
make sure that seating is available.
As far as architectural changes they cannot make a structural changes or changes to the
exterior. In terms of maintenance, they will create a capital reserve account to be funded
and maintained to certain levels for major repairs and replacements.

They are also including requirements for an insurance program that will take liability and
will revisit the limits every 5 years if not more often.

The lease need to comply with FTA requirements as well as the ADA in terms of no
discrimination based on race, color, etc., and no conflict of interest, debarment or
suspension.
The use of the plaza needs to be safe for everybody. They have asked for easements and
convenience and for each building have a 15’ area that can be used as outdoor seating
and activities zone. USA has also asked that there is 12-15’ buffer zone with no
structures, no kiosks and no parking. The building entryway needs to be free of
obstructions. Amtrak also has the same expectation.
When scheduling events in evening hours, they need to make sure that they are mindful
that it is a hotel.
Director Deadwyler stated that when they had the initial discussions about the hotel, the
noise level and things that could be a distraction were discussed. She was under the
impression that it would not be a problem. What she understands is that activities need to
end early to avoid the noise. Marla commented that RTD will not put the conditions in the
Great Hall, as they will have some bars and guests will need to be ready for people coming
and going.
Director Deadwyler also asked what they meant by seating availability. Marla explained
there are seating and outdoor activity zones attached to each building. The public part of
the plaza is part of the DUS project open to the public and it will have a fountain, trees
and build in seating.
Director Malpiede asked what is going to happen with the Model Railroad piece in the
basement. Marla explained that the lease itself does not have a requirement for any
special tenants other than RTD and Amtrak. They have not specifically provided for the
Rail Association. Ms. Dana Crawford stated that the Model Railroad Association wants to
maintain those two projects as assets to the community and be open more hours. They
are in the process of moving their tracks and they will have some leasing with USA for the
use of the space. A new 21st century approach to invite the public to use and be able to
see their collection.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Oct 30, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

With regard to mortgage and assignment, this goes into change of use. The team
proposes until 2016 to assign leasehold interest to a qualified management company with
relevant experience and no history of criminal activity and no denial of liquor license.

Director Hoy expressed some concerns about the changes in use. It is his understanding
that because it is a national historic building that cannot be done. Marla explained that the
National Park Service (NPS) takes control of the inside of the building and the Landmark
Preservation Commission (LPC) manages the outside of the building. The NPS requirement
is only for 5 years. The building is protected from demolition and major modifications.
They are talking about improvements to the building and some changes are acceptable as
long as they are not structural and maintain the Great Hall’s integrity. Nothing can be
done without the LPC approval. The restrictions continue in the structure but not in the
use. Director Hoy asked what kind of control RTD will have.
Marla explained that
anything related to structural changes, both outside and inside, will still have to come to
the Board.
Director Malpiede asked about the roof top and the hotel rooms planned for that area.
Marla stated that the NPS did not allow everything USA wanted, they only allowed for
partial modification. Mr. Jim Johnson explained that they will put some suites in the attic
instead of regular hotel rooms and that they have reduced the number of rooms proposed.
Director James wanted clarification if because the NPS permitted some modifications in
the interior and exteriors, once that is all done any further significant changes would
require the NPS’ approval. Jim explained that the tax credits USA is seeking require Park
Service approval of any changes for five years after build out. After that it would be under
the LPC. Marla stated that RTD would have some approval of those changes like exterior,
structure and historic fabric of the Great Hall. Other than that the renter can take care of
the interior spaces. If alterations are proposed by the tenant, RTD would have the
opportunity to approve during the 99 years. That is what staff has asked for. Jim
Johnson explained that anytime a permit is required it goes to the LPC before it goes to
the building permit office. In the interior the tenant will have freedom to do changes as
long as they do not alter the structure of the building or the historic fabric of the Great
Hall. In terms of the Great Hall, RTD will have the opportunity to approve substantial
changes to it. Director James asked if the LPC has the right to approve substantial
changes in the Great Hall. Marla responded that they don’t since their premise is only in
the exterior of the building.
Mr. Walter Isenberg expressed his appreciation for the work the staff has done and they
look forward to moving the project forward.

Paperless Packet Training-Board members
Training for the new Paperless Packet and eBoardroom was conducted with the Board of
Directors. Paula Perdue, Barbara McManus and Erin Klaas reviewed eBoardroom, the
RTD/IQM2 Web Portal and Hub navigation with Directors. In eBoardroom Board members
were shown how to vote, how to request to speak, and how the timer would work for
public participation.
The rules of engagement for conducting meetings were also
discussed. Board members were shown how to log-in and access the paperless packet
through the RTD/IQM2 web portal.
Director Tayer thanked the Board staff for all the hard work. He also thanked Director
Tobiassen for championing paperless packets. Director Malpiede mentioned that she has
seen the staff working really hard toward these training sessions. Paula thanked the IT
group for all their support.

Updates

• Rocky Mountain Performance Excellence Award
Kim Griffith, Executive Director of Rocky Mountain Excellence Award
announced that RTD received the 2012 Rocky Mountain Performance
Excellence Award at the Timberline Level for the FasTracks Program. She
mentioned that they have a very rigorous process and RTD earned this
award.
Director Cohen congratulated Rick Clarke and the entire FasTracks team, as
this award represents a commitment to excellence and the rigorous review
process really shows the caliber of staff at RTD.
Director Gore asked if there are other levels. Ms. Griffith stated that the
highest level is the Peak Award and the RTD staff stated that they are
working to achieve that level. Having the outside perspective gives them
the feedback they need to improve.
General Manager Washington thanked the staff and the RTD Board as this is
a total team effort. He also mentioned that the completion of the FasTracks
program is what is driving the staff.
Director McMullen stated that he appreciated that award and seeing
FasTracks working.

• Patton Boggs Annual Federal Update

6.B

Kevin O’Neil introduced himself and the Patton Boggs team. RTD has a lot
to be proud of and his team looks forward to working with the newly elected
Board members.

RTD is also committed to workforce development through the WIN program
which was recognized by the White House under the “Champions of
Change” initiative. This is very significant as it might become one of the
signature initiatives of the Obama administration.
The key elements for RTD’s success have been a unified government
support and being able to advocate as a region. RTD also meets or exceeds
ridership projections and maintains a strong base system. The exceptional
staff relationships with FTA, strong labor relations and having
comprehensive plan for the region contribute to RTD’s success.
Jared Flesher provided an overview of the Moving Ahead Progress in the
21st Century Act (MAP-21) which was enacted by President Obama on July
6th, 2012. This includes a two year reauthorization at current level plus
inflation which will expire on September 30th, 2014. The act transfers $22
billion into the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to cover the funding gap. This
shows the importance of transportation infrastructure.
It eliminates most discretionary programs and expands formula programs.
What this means to RTD is that it eliminates bus and bus facilities grant
programs. Patton Boggs has worked with RTD to secure grants under this
program. It also combines remaining bus funds with rail modernization funds
to create a new “State of Good Repair” formula program; this eliminates
legacy earmarks and provides more funding for newer systems. Ultimately
the State of Colorado and RTD receive the same amount of funding but
receive guaranteed funding instead of the “ups and downs” of discretionary
grants.
In 2012, Colorado Transit Funding received $89 million based on formula
funding and $14 million in discretionary bus grants for a total of $103
million in 2012; Under MAP-21, Colorado Transit Funding will receive
$103.9 million in formula funding for 2013 and $105.4 million in formula
funding for 2014.

Mr. O’Neil reviewed the major RTD successes which include $1.03 billion
Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for Eagle P3 among others listed in the
presentation. He stated that this is a very impressive display of success and
that RTD has achieved these milestones while implementing the only
successful public-private partnership for Eagle P3 which resulted in RTD
receiving the World Finance Award.

6.B

MAP-21 creates new transit oriented development (TOD) pilot programs
which provides a potential funding source for TOD planning along RTD’s
new transit corridors. It also expands TIFIA programs which provide
financing opportunities for RTD; however, they are subject to RTD’s revenue
and debt constraints. RTD needs to leverage the money through this new
program. MAP-21 also streamlines the NEPA process which was designed
to accelerate project delivery to save money and time. West Corridor and
Eagle P3 should qualify for this.
MAP-21 is what we wanted from RTD’s perspective.
Anne Miano thanked the Board for working with Patton Boggs and stated
that it helped to make their work in Washington, D.C. easier. RTD has
become a model for transit authorities and is very well known for what it is
doing. RTD is being studied all over the country. She thanked the Board
members that are leaving and mentioned that Patton Boggs will need the
support from the incoming members as the new legislative agenda is
developed. MAP-21 expires September 30, 2012. At that time Congress
will have to reauthorize MAP-21 and determine how to pay for it.
RTD’s priorities will be to avoid program cuts and preserve dedicated transit
funding. A priority is also to ensure that RTD and Colorado get their fair
share of transit funding, streamline the new starts process and maintain
eligibility for BRT projects that do not use bus-only lanes.
With regard to the impact of the election, Congressman Bill Shuster has
been elected Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure (HTI)
committee and has expressed his desire to stabilize the HTI with long-term
dedicated revenue. Kevin mentioned that it is important to bring him to the
Denver area as soon as possible. It will be interesting to see how things
shape up. Soon after the election, many politicians started to cut the deals
they needed. A lot of insiders are frustrated because only some of the
stakeholders are present in the negotiations.
With regard to the “Fiscal Cliff”, Anne stated that in order to avoid the fiscal
cliff Congress must act quickly. If sequestration happens it will not impact
highway trust funds programs; however, it would impact new start
Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 4, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

RTD received $48.3 million in Urbanized Area Formula, $7.4 million for Bus
and Bus Facilities Discretionary/Formula Program and 6.8 million in Rail
Modernization/State of Good Repair for a total of $62.5 million in 2012.
Under MAP-21 RTD would receive $48.8, $4.4 and 8.5 million for a total of
$61.7 million for 2013 and $49.5, $4.5 and $8.6 for a total of $62.6 million
in 2014. The amount is constant; what changes is the way it is calculated;
it’s a flat rate.

6.B

If nothing happens, taxes will go up and sequestration will happen
automatically. As late as this afternoon the President did not accept the
counteroffer that House Speaker Boehner had offered. Anne stated that her
team tends to believe that some solution or agreement will happen in
December.
On revenue, whatever deal they put together 2013 will be the most
aggressive in terms of fiscal reform. The Simpson-Bowles proposal would
raise the gas tax and allocated 100% of that revenue for transportation
funding.
The key issues and priorities for RTD include avoiding cuts to the new starts
program as part of the resolution to the fiscal cliff; advocate for funding for
the Eagle P3 in FY2013; and in case of programs cuts, RTD will need to
prioritize projects such as Eagle P3 that are more advanced in the FFGA
process.
With regard to new starts funding, Patton Boggs will work with
Congressional Delegation and FTA to lay the groundwork and make the case
for continued investment in the Denver region.
Patton Boggs believe that RTD’s projects are very well set up. They think
that for the P3 project, since it is the only one in the country, a case can be
made in order to have Congress find the money to finance it.
Patton Boggs plans to look at any programs that have some carry over funds
and make sure that RTD’s programs are in line for those funds.
Director Bagley thanked them for the presentation and asked what the
timing is to know if the $150 million appropriations for 2013 will be
available. Kevin stated that Congress has negotiated a lot of the bills, but
they can’t determine the transportation part due to the fiscal cliff. One of
the elements of the present plans is that they include $150 million of
infrastructure. Patton Boggs will have a good sense of where we are
headed once they achieve a deal at the end of December. There are three
possible outcomes. First they hope to get the whole amount RTD was
expecting for the Eagle P3 project. The worst case scenario would be RTD
getting about $12-15 million. Mid outcome would be that once they have
Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 4, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

programs. She mentioned that they expect a deal will be achieved, which
will probably set the framework for fiscal reform and include spending cuts
this year. The federal transportation program is funded mainly by the gas
tax which has been set at a fixed 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. This
tax has declined due to more fuel efficient vehicles on the road, which has
created a $15 billion funding gap per year.

6.B

the agreement they will sit down and figure out how to allocate the money.
The completion of the appropriation process is done in the spring.

Director O’Boyle asked if MAP-21 keeps the amount of funding the same but
increases the number of organizations that are eligible. Jared stated that a
realistic view is that they did expand eligibility. For MAP-21 they look at
agency reputation and how much money the agency brings to the table.
Anne explained that MAP-21 is one account that is not allocated between
funds. This also takes away some of the competitors for FasTracks. The set
of core projects that benefit New York and Chicago also benefit Denver.
Director Gore asked how the national sales tax for internet sales will be
collected. Kevin stated that internet has exploded and brick and mortar
companies feel that they are at a disadvantage. They are working on getting
a standard system for states to collect; RTD will need to figure out how to
get its fair share. Director Gore also asked if with regard to the $0.15
increase on gas tax if there is a different tax for diesel and mentioned that
Colorado is also considering a $0.10 increase which would make it a $0.25
increase and asked if RTD’s budget prepared to handle that. Jared stated
that the gas tax has been the most difficult item for the government
politically; they have not been able to raise the gas tax since 1993. Some
congressmen will probably vote for the Simpson-Bowels since they would
not be voting for tax increase directly. Many Republicans would rather go
into the cliff to avoid having to vote for tax increases.
Director McMullen thanked them for the work they have done. He
mentioned to the newly elected Board members that when they go to
Washington in March the Patton Boggs team will be organized and prepared.
He asked the Patton Boggs group how well they know Congressman
Schuster. Kevin stated that they had a relationship with him before he came
to office. They supported his campaign and his Deputy Chief of Staff
worked closely with Jared and Kevin. They know him well and respect him.
He jumped the ladder very quickly and jumped over many others with more
seniority and received their support. He will be bi-partisan in his approach.
They would want to have him here for the ribbon cutting in the spring.
Director Daly asked what sequestration is. Kevin stated that when the
needed to address the deficit line and cut a deal to raise the credit line they
Packet Pg. 17

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 4, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Malpiede asked about the relationship with Secretary LaHood and if
he is staying. Kevin stated that the staff like him but it is unclear at this
point; he might want to go back to Illinois and run for office there. There
have been some names thrown in the mix. Among them is the Mayor of LA,
the former Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell, and Chuck Hagel, the
former Nebraska Senator.

Director Daly thanked them for their presentation and stated that he looks
forward to seeing them in March.

created a super committee. With regard to the fiscal cliff, if that super
committee fails the sequestration process happens and cuts will be made
across the board. Sequestration will cut half of the defense side but it
cannot affect manpower or veterans which leaves research and medical
accounts. The other 50% comes from domestic discretionary expenditures.
Everything is in there; transportation is largely in there except for new starts.
On January 1, if nothing happens we could be looking about 10% in cuts for
the rest of the year from every program and account. There are several
other scenarios like “kick the can” which creates a framework form.

Recommended Actions

• Disposition Plan for Excess Land in Ft. Lupton, Weld County
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for
the 80,173 square feet (1.84 acres) net of county road right of way located
at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort Lupton, Colorado and further authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute a contract
for the sale of the property.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the
motion to move this item to the
full Board at the December 18th,
2012 Board meeting.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:

John Shonsey stated that back in 2007 RTD had an
agreement with Pacific Railroad Company and this property
was purchased as part of the agreement. In May 2008 the
Board passed a resolution that the property acquired by Union
Pacific was no longer needed. The property was first offered
to the original owners at the price the owner paid but the
owners did not wish to buy back the property.
An unsolicited offer has been received from the Villano
Brothers Properties, Inc. An appraisal report was completed
by Sue Ann Foster, MAI, Foster Valuation Company LLC.
They have concluded that property is valued at $135,000 or
80,173 square feet at $2.25 per square foot ($180,389) less
demolition costs of $45,000. The property will be sold “as iswhere is”. If approved by the Board, the proceeds will be
assigned to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account.

Director Daly asked why the property is listed at 1.84 acres
and the map shows 1.9. John explained that the map
included the roadway area.

Director Tobiassen asked if this had gone through the RFP
process. John stated that since it has been on the market for
several years it did not go through the RFP process and the
unsolicited proposal offers fair market price. As long as it has
been in the market the RFP process is not required. John also
stated that RTD has received other offers over the years but
they were substantially lower than the appraisal.
Director Hoy asked if the property was listed for sale. John
stated that it has been in the market but it has not been listed.
Director Hoy asked how it was marketed. Staff stated that it
was through verbal communication and the real estate agents
in that area knew it was available. Director Hoy also asked if
the offer came before or after the appraisal was done. Staff
stated that it came before the appraisal. The offer is a little bit
less than the market value determined. Director Hoy stated
that he wants to have a discussion about how we go about
marketing these properties. In this instance we are probably
getting a fair value but we might not be getting the best value.
Director Hoy would like to be part of the discussions.
Director McMullen stated that this closes another chapter in
FasTracks. He is happy to see it go and get the fair value.
Director James asked if the appraised value is the $135
thousand. John explained the value of the appraisal is $180
thousand, but includes the demolition cost. Director James
asked what constitutes marketing property. John stated that
even though it was not listed with a broker it was made well
known to the real estate agents in the area. Director James
also questioned the use of the term unsolicited proposal. He
does not think that is accurate because the property was on
the market and therefore we are accepting offers.
Committee Chair Bagley declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 4, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director O’Boyle asked why if the appraisal states that the
property is being sold “as is-where is” the demolition is being
charged to RTD. John stated that the appraisal takes into
consideration that the homes/buildings are not habitable; they
have been vandalized since RTD acquired them.

Updates

• Quarterly Transit Oriented Development Update
Bill Sirois stated that the report focuses on what has been accomplished in
2012. TOD accomplishments include the pilot programs for the Alameda
station, the Olde Town Arvada-Gold, Welton Corridor and the Federal Center
West. Other accomplishments include the Boulder Junction which with
public-private partnership allows for economic development and Denver
Union Station. This include 71 units of income restricted affordable housing,
140 room hotel and redevelopment of the historic depot which is anticipated
to close by mid December 2012, with groundbreaking in January 2013 and
reopening by the Spring of 2014.
The Arvada Ridge – Gold, the developer, and RTD will partner to construct
garage with income restricted affordable housing.
Staff is currently
reviewing a proposal for operational and feasibility. The next steps will be
presented in Q1 2013.
Denver Union Station Historic Building – the staff successfully negotiated
the master lease with Union Station Alliance (USA). Construction will begin
in December and it will be closed to public until 2014.
Bill Sirois stated that he expects to engage more with Aurora. He also
shared that next week he will have a Wykoop Plaza meeting to focus on the
management and programming of the open space in front of the station.
The meeting will be in the T&D conference room on Wednesday.
Director James asked if the University Station is scheduled for next year.
Director Daly stated that new work keeps popping up and he asked for an
explanation. Bill Sirois explained one of the goals of the pilot program is
looking at how we are involved and we want to be in a position that is
catalytic and that is consistent with area plans. In the case of the Alameda
station we are looking beyond the RTD property.
Director Tayer stated he wanted to recognize the staff for all the planning
and outreach they did to get the Boulder Junction going.
Director Malpiede also applauded the staff for their innovation and for
looking into all TOD projects. She asked with the federal incentives on hold
if there is an opportunity to have an evaluation. They are trying to address
the questions among the staff and hope that it can translate into a process

Packet Pg. 22

III.

6.C

where everybody understands the criteria that they are looking for and hope
some of those pilots graduate.

Director McMullen asked for an update on the Colorado Station and the
easement with Lincoln properties that had been approved in prior years. Bill
Sirois stated that it was never started. Director McMullen asked about the
Southmoor station. Sirois stated that it has been put on the back burner.
On the Belleview station Director McMullen asked if anything is happening
there. Bill Sirois stated that when they made the deal with the developer,
RTD built a temporary facility in their property and the developer would build
a permanent one outside the facility when it was developed. The developer
is ready to decommission the temporary bus facility.
Director McMullen requested update on the Orchard station and if the City of
Greenwood Village is going to put their city hall in that area as they have
been planning. Bill Sirois stated that City wants to meet with staff as their
developer has a plan for 50 units of office space. With regard to the Dayton
Station, nothing is being pursued.
Director McMullen stated that on 9 mile, the property owners don’t seem to
get it together. Bill Sirois said it was in limbo for a while. Aurora just went
back and amended it, but has not heard if the developers are moving
forward.
Director James thanked staff for all their work on University Station. The
feedback that he has received is that RTD is really a catalyst.
Director Deadwyler asked about development in the Welton Corridor; Bill
Sirois explained that staff had talked to the stakeholders about doing a
project in that area. Staff wants to have something that will generate other
interest. With this process they have generated a lot of information that
they have shared with the community along the corridor for development.
They are trying to see what else can be done. Director Deadwyler asked if
RTD is taking the lead. Bill Sirois stated that they have said to the City that
RTD is not going to be the first one if there’s nobody else aligning with them
and ready to develop. GM Washington stated that this is two different
things. Bill is talking about the revitalization of the area and the other is the
mobility aspect.
Director Bagley asked if the TOD design criteria are completed and if it is
being used in other projects. Kate Iverson stated that they have been

Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 4, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director McMullen asked if there are any updated about the DU Station. Bill
Sirois stated that they did get the funding for the low income housing.
Director McMullen asked if there was any progress on the vacant space near
the station. Bill Sirois stated that the two first proposals were deemed non
responsive. Staff did another RFP and they did not get any proposals. Staff
proposes to take it off the market and see how RTD could use the space and
hopefully get better proposals once the market recovers. Director McMullen
asked if the issue was that there is no access to water. Bill affirmed that
the water access is one of the issues and there is no space for parking.

6.C

working very close with the City of Arvada in getting a master plan and the
criteria in place. The TOD design criteria clearly articulate how to develop
our station in that environment. Director Bagley thanked them and asked if
moving forward or looking ahead they will revise the TOD in 2013. Staff
stated that they expect that by the 2nd half of the year they will have the
2013 revisions. Director Bagley recommended reaching out to clients to get
an understanding and put together a lessons learned kind of document.

• Lease of Parking to Mile High Development, LLC at University Station
Bill Sirois stated that in Feb 2011 the Board authorized staff to move
forward with developing a parking lease structure for the property north of
the DU parking garage. This has been acquired from us to develop a
housing project. The terms of that would be $30 a month per space and
adjusted every 5 years. RTD has coordinated with the development team on
this project and after further review of the payment terms they have a
different proposal. Mile High will agree to buy the 50 units and RTD has
agreed to provide a discount to $25 per space. Mile High will also purchase
Eco Passes for all of its residents. Central Parking will manage the spaces
just like other parking in the system. Staff has concluded that this approach
will build ridership. Also the contract ensures that the parking is used for
transit. This means RTD will get $11 less for each space but Mile High will
pay annually through the EcoPasses. They will pay a little bit more since the
total would be $36. Staff thinks this is a better approach as it encourages
ridership and overall works better. The neighborhood EcoPass program is a
good program to use in this type of circumstance.
Director Tayer stated that it does have a very attractive look and feel. The
purpose was to provide disadvantage people to have access to the service.
Director Tayer applauded the creativity and the fact that the math also
makes sense.
Director Tobiassen stated that the EcoPass is an interesting concept and
asked if it would be required for each tenant to have the EcoPass. Staff
affirmed that they would be required. Director Tobiassen asked how many
parking spaces are being provided. Staff stated that there are about 20
spaces on site with an overall potential for 70 spaces. Director Tobiassen
asked if there are elevators in this parking garage. Staff stated that they
have developed a solution with providing 6 spaces right outside the front
door for the Access-a-Ride. Director Tobiassen asked if they have any idea
of the number of riders that will be generated. Staff stated that at this point
they don’t know. Director Tobiassen requested the staff to provide a
projection.
With regard to the DU station, Director Tobiassen asked if one of the two
bidders was proposing storage and we did not accept the proposal, why we

Packet Pg. 24

With regard to the Strategic Parking Plan, Director Bagley stated that he is
happy to see they are reviewing this and asked if they have an idea of the
timing. Staff expressed that they would expect that in the 2nd half of 2013.

6.C

are going to use it for storage. Staff stated that this is in lieu of paying for
storage as we do currently.

Director Deadwyler asked why we are not considering some
accommodations that would allow the senior citizens to park closer to their
units. She stated that we are not taking their issues and being concerned
about them. When we are negotiated these deals we need to do a better
job about that and be more considerate about our handicapped. Bill Sirois
stated that the way the deal has been structured is that the property is very
limited. RTD is working with the developers to provide the parking space in
a facility that we already owned.
Director McMullen asked how many spaces there are. Staff responded that
there are 540 and in a good month they have 80% use. Director McMullen
commented that at the beginning there was staff in the booth. Bill Sirois
stated that they discontinued that because it is not needed. There is not
overnight parking allowed and the residents would have a sticker for
overnight parking.
Director Walker mentioned that in 2005 the project was very different, but it
is good to see to see something finally coming to this site.
Director Bagley commented that on the issue of the parking it is important to
accommodate that into our parking management and setting a model to deal
with senior citizens. He thanked the staff for working with Mile High
development.

progressively looking to our real estate assets.

Recommended Actions

• Moving Forward: Filling the FasTracks Internal Savings Account
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the
eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the
Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Any funding realized through these activities
will be tracked separately and added to a new budget account, the
FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). The status of the FISA will be
reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly basis, and the FISA will
be incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan and Annual
Budget. Expenditures from the FISA will be subject to Board approval, with
the staff recommended project goals identified below in the Background
section of this report confirmed as the current RTD Board project goals for
the FISA.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following
activities:
1. Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system
operations at the rate of inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index
(CPI):
 Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;

Packet Pg. 27

Director Tobiassen left early.

2. Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction
milestones have been reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant
funding has been received and RTD has better information on the growth of
sales and use tax:
 Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;
3. Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from
three to two months:
 Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;
4. Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation
– complete once funding is identified for the entire project:
 Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;
5. Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under
contract:
 Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;
6. Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
 Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;
7. Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current
level of 2.5%:
 Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;
8. Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and
provide RTD with parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure
exemptions are the same for both RTD and the State in all cases). Establish
this as RTD’s number one legislative priority. Begin working immediately
with government relations staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other
stakeholders to initiate and support the introduction of a bill(s) on these
topics during the 2013 legislative session:
 Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.
Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the
FasTracks capital program through the establishment of the FISA with a goal
of achieving $300 million by 2017. It is anticipated that these eight highest
priority opportunities alone could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277
million by 2017. The Board directs staff to continue working to identify
other funding opportunities through the RAM analysis process in 2013 for
potential Board consideration at a later date.
Motion:

Director Malpiede made the
motion to move this item to the
full Board at the December 18th,
2012 Board meeting.
Director O’Boyle seconded the
motion.

General Manager Phil Washington stated that he had asked
staff to review these items with each Board member and that
the most frequently asked questions have been addressed in
the presentation that is part of the packet. He stated that in
November staff presented the eight, highest value,
recommended opportunities identified as part of the RAM. For
each of these opportunities, staff identified an estimated
contribution to the FISA by 2017 and a level of risk.
Director Tayer complimented the staff for another great
implementation plan and for taking the time to walk him
through the list. He wants to confirm that the funding of this
initiative will not have any impact on the frequency of services
for US-36 BRT. Staff stated that for all FasTracks programs
for both rail and bus rapid transit and the downtown circulator
they have identified funding for all the operations and
maintenance and there is not impact to rubber-tire allocation or
steel wheel allocation. This remains in the budget including
US-36.
With regard to the 2.5% match, Director Tayer also asked if
there are any expectations that the staff would prioritize or
give favoritism to corridors based on that contribution. Bill
Van Meter stated that the Board adopted FasTracks plan
establishes the 2.5% match and that’s the only enforceable
expectation. He does not anticipate any prioritization by the
staff as that would be a Board decision. Rick Clarke stated
that financing is tight and any outside money will help,
however that would be voluntary and that’s why we can’t
count on it. T-Rex is a good example; 30 million in cash came
from the community. Communities are willing to participate
in order to get those lines in their area. But the money could
help move those corridors faster. Based on the support and
responses from the staff, Director Tayer stated that he will
support the RAM.
Director Bagley asked GM Washington if based on Patton
Boggs report, and if sequestration happens, would this money
be used for the Eagle P3 project since this is the number one
project. GM Washington stated that there are some
contingencies outside this process that can be used to cover if
there is a shortfall. That’s part of the reserves on the
FasTracks side are for. Staff feels confident that they will able
to continue if there is a shortfall.

Discussion:

On item four “Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union
Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation – complete once funding is
identified for the entire project”, Director Bagley mentioned
that when the $305 million fund was made available because
of the savings for the Eagle P3 project, there was $90 million
for the I-225 corridor, $90 million for the BRT to Boulder, $90
for the North Metro, $10 for the Southeast Corridor for
different activities, $9 million for the Southwest corridor for
the relocation of the Union Pacific railroad tracks, and about
$1 million for the Central corridor. He stated that that is what
was stated from those corridors as to how the money would
be allocated. He has talked to Rick Clarke and they had
agreed that they would go to the communities in the
Southwest corridor and explain this. He understands that until
the construction of the Southwest corridor is fully funded, it is
not viable to use the $9 million. He wants a commitment from
the staff that they will explain this to the Southwest area
communities including the extension through Littleton from
Mineral down to C-470 and Lucent, the Highlands Ranch
Community Association, Highlands Ranch Metro District, the
Highlands Ranch Chamber of Commerce as well as the South
Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce and the Denver South
Economic Development Partnership so they understand what
we are doing. He will support this initiative with the
understanding that this communication will take place. GM
Washington stated that the staff will go and explain that and
reinstate the quarterly meeting with all the corridors. He
wants to make sure they understand that the deferral of the
relocation does not negatively affect the construction of that
extension. He also mentioned that he had met with the VP of
Union Pacific today and does not believe that the provisions of
this initiative will change from the perspective of the railroad.
Director Bagley stated that he will participate in the outreach
to the community.
Director Hoy thanked Director Bagley for his statement and
appreciate that he is looking to the big picture. With regard to
project underruns he asked if there are funds available at the
end of the projects such as I-225 and P3, will this go to this
fund. GM Washington sated that they will look at funds from
all small and big FasTracks project and will present that to the
Board and ask for a decision about the funds going into the
internal savings account.

Director Hoy said that on the sales tax he is not clear which
level it would be. He asked if we would be auditing the state
books on what is being collected and given to RTD. Another
aspect is to audit if they are correctly collecting the money
from the businesses, or auditing the businesses and see if they
are collecting and paying the proper amounts of taxes to the
state. Terry Howerter stated that those are the different
levels; however the first thing is to get through the
confidentiality agreement that will allow RTD to share the data
received from the State with a third party or bring it in-house
and do the data mining and then identify what the next steps
are. We would probably have to start with our records to
compare with what the state has and look for any
discrepancies and make the necessary adjustments between
the state records and RTD’s. If we could get self-collection it
would take out the allocation risk; however, it has come back
strongly that it would not pass through legislation. The first
step will be deciding how RTD will audit the data, in-house or
through a third party or send it back to the State. RTD pays
the state for that service, but at this point we don’t know
what they audit or what the results are.
Director Hoy asked if with regard to auditing the vendor, will
we be going into the vendor and checking their record to see if
they paid the proper taxes. Terry Howerter affirmed that it
would be just like what the State or cities do. Director Hoy
also asked about the estimated amount derived from this,
which seems like it has not been defined. Terry Howerter
stated that from the $127 million there is $23-24 million that
goes to parity and they want to have parity with the State.
The second part is going to the collection period where we will
see and improvement in the audit and so the first year we
might pick up $25-$30 million that would be there on the 2nd,
3rd and 4th years. The total amount is accumulated overtime.
Bank Counsel has stated that school districts and
municipalities they have worked with have seen a 20%
Packet Pg. 31

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 4, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy also asked if there has been any consideration to
put the million dollars a year derived from turning Denver
Union Station (DUS) over to our partners. GM Washington
explained that in lieu of that being a Base System project they
would have to look at that and also take into consideration
that there are some federal requirements in terms of what is
left. Again, these items would be brought to the Board for
decision.

6.D

Director Deadwyler thanked staff for their patience and going
through the process with her. She wanted to make sure the
staff addresses the questions she has presented and will wait
for their responses before she can support this initiative. Her
concern with option one with regard to rubber tire services is
that she had asked for different scenarios in terms of what it
would look like. She has found that one of the scenarios
might throw RTD out of budget for 2014-2017 and would
probably have to look elsewhere to find money to cover that
shortfall. One of her questions with regard to the $300 million
is when the work will actually start. If it starts now, and the
money is being spent upfront because it will take a couple of
years to save the total amount, based on underruns
mentioned, RTD might have to reach into this money to cover
for the shortfall and it would take even longer to save the
money. This brings another issue because there is no sunset
and this could go on forever which is not fair either. She
stated that the Fiscal Sustainability team worked so hard to
put the current policy together and now this initiative is
throwing that out. RTD would end up having no policy in
place or change the entire policy to include this. She has
asked to see if something different can be done to include
some language that under certain circumstances we would be
able to revert back to where we are now instead of having to
rewrite policy to go back if this doesn’t work. She had
proposed to separate the reserve funding out of this package.
Director Deadwyler thinks the Board needs to look at this very
carefully before putting it in place. Bill Van Meter stated that
on the topic of sunset, the intent is for this is to be a short
term commitment to expedite the FasTracks project. Even
though there is no specific date for the sunset it would be a
Board option at any point to change it. It is also noted that
the intent is to get to the full rubber tire commitment as
originally established; this is just a deferral in time and it will
be articulated in the plans. Director Cohen clarified that the
commitment is not forgone, it’s only being deferred. Bill Van
Meter also stated that the reserve policy change from 3
Packet Pg. 32

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 4, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

increase on their sales taxes. An outside vendor has stated
that amount would run between 15% and 30% depending on
how the records are retained and how good the job of the
current collector is. Staff is estimating 17% for the audit.
Director Hoy requested to have some time to discuss this
further.

6.D

Director Deadwyler stated that even with the deferral it still
throws the budget out because we would not be able to
balance the budget from 2014-2017. Terry Howerter stated
that he did not see the sheets that Director Deadwyler
mentioned that staff produced. The sheets that they
generated in answer to a GMR show that any year where
there is a deficit in 2014-2015 created by the reduction of
rubber-tire, they took money out of the Capital Acquisition
fund to rebalance the budget. That grew the Capital
Acquisition fund slower overtime and he believes that what
staff did is that they let the budget go negative. Bill Van
Meter also stated that what staff provided were two
scenarios, one based on the SBP based on the earliest CU
Leeds forecast and the second scenario with the same budget
but using the updated August CU Leeds forecast. This along
with the actuals to date turned the negative balances to
positives. Terry Howerter will review the sheets and sit down
with Director Deadwyler to make sure they understand and
address her concerns.
Director Cohen stated that when he sat down with staff he
understood that the RAM, while aggressive in some respects,
has latitude for some flexibility and if the landscape would
radically change we could revisit it but that is within the Board
purview.
Director Deadwyler stated that she still has questions and is
not ready to support it yet. She doesn’t want it to go to
unanimous consent until her questions are answered.
Director McMullen stated that he understands Director
Deadwyler’s concerns and hopes the Board can be unanimous
when this item is voted on at the December Board meeting.
This is a road map and the Board needs to see that FasTracks
gets done. It is the General Manager’s job is to show the
Board how to get there. This can be achieved without having
Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 4, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

months to 2 months is only for the FasTracks for the short
term period 2014-2017. Staff agreed they will provide more
information for Director Deadwyler. Director Cohen also
clarified that on the 1% rubber-tire service the FAQs establish
that it will still see a commitment at the CPI level and any year
that there is a negative CPI there will be a 0% change in the
rubber tire commitment. Staff affirmed Director Cohen’s
statement.

6.D

Director Bagley thanked Director Hoy for his comments. He
stated for the new members that there is a reason why this is
called the Regional Transportation District; we all need to think
regionally. The FasTracks program will make a difference for
the next century.
Director O’Boyle thanked the GM and staff for seeking new
ways to fund the FasTracks projects. However, he is
disappointed that the Southeast corridor is not identified as
part of the priorities. Also on the Southwest corridor, he
believes deferral of the relocation falls into the same category
as purchasing right of way or completing the federal
environmental review process as they don’t provide immediate
mobility benefit. He takes note that the issue might raise
concern from stakeholders for the reasons stated by Director
Bagley. He does not think it is a good move to reduce the
support that we have for one area in order to relocated the
funds to another area. He wants to make sure that the
concerns generated by the stakeholders area addressed.
On the concerns about the going over the cliff is the possibility
of a recession. Director O’Boyle remembers that the last
recession was not fun and will not be fun for anybody
including this agency. He would want a caveat in the plan so
that we do not put in concrete something that is dependent on
the fiscal cliff that is far above our pay rate and beyond our
control. We need to wait and see what D.C. does. On
Director Deadwyler’s comments in terms of fiscal
sustainability, we must increase service measurably. We
should not spend what we have just because we have it; that
way we are not overextended. He thinks that tailoring
additional rubber tire services to the curtail FasTracks
programs is a good move and consistent with what the agency
should do with respect to increasing services. He suggests
that we should try to qualify for some of the rubber tire
service expansion because we have cut steel and wheel

Packet Pg. 34

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 4, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

to go back to the voters. He is excited. With regard to the
Union Pacific, he doesn’t see a problem in the Southeast.
Value engineering was a great lesson in the West corridor and
we have learned a lot. In terms of the sunset, RTD as an
organization does not have a sunset. He congratulated GM
Washington and the staff and stated that he will support the
initiative.

service and if ware going to regain that service, it would
require funds from our base system.

Director Walker stated that he thinks the strategy allows
enough flexibility to change our position and move money
around. There is a risk on doing anything or not doing
anything and he would rather air on the side of action. He had
some concerns about the relocation delay of the UP lines due
to the traffic load. He will support the recommendation and
hopefully the neighboring communities that are eager to get
service will participate to get those services in their area more
quickly and put people on our buses and trains. He will
support the initiative.
Director Gore stated that with all the awards this agency has
received both nationally and internationally, he looks forward
to the day they receive an award for the boldness of moving
this initiative forward.
GM Washington stated that when they put this exercise
together they looked at risk versus reward and that is why
they assigned a level of risk to each action. They built in a
level of flexibility to each item. When we talk about
sequestration and all the federal issues, we can turn around
quickly. The reward of accomplishing these projects is greater
than the risk. They would never come to the Board with
initiatives that would decimate bus or rail services. They
would not come to ask for a deferral of the extension if they
thought they could not do it in the future. Getting FasTracks
built as much as we can, as fast as we can is part of the
mandate for the organization. They would not bring
something that will jeopardize the base system or derail the
budget. The amount of reward for getting I-225 or US-36
completed will be great.
Director Cohen thanked Director Gore for his comments. He
thanked the staff for the innovative thinking and
acknowledged he is confident that the staff would not lead the
Board into making decisions that are not financially prudent.
Committee Chair Cohen declared the motion PASSED.

the North Metro Rail Line
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the
purchase of six Electric Multiple Units (EMU) vehicles for the North Metro
Rail Line through the Denver Transit Partners (DTP) Rolling Stock Option
in accordance with the EAGLE Concession Agreement (CA) Section 31.1,
for an amount not to exceed $24 million. Funding to purchase two of the
vehicles is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North Metro
Corridor project.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to transfer $16
million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to the North Metro
Corridor project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU
vehicles.

motion.

Discussion:

Director McMullen asked if there are any savings involved in
this action. GM Washington stated that there is a timeline to
exercise the option to get these vehicles at the lower price.
Rick Clarke stated that if they do not exercise the option they
would have to go out and bid it separately. For such a small
order the cost could be at least $25 million instead of $16
million and they would be a different type of vehicle, which
will also impact the mechanics and train operators. After
December they would have to order a minimum of 8 cars for
the option and there is no money for that in the budget.
Director Bagley stated that he thinks this is the most prudent
thing to do.

• Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements and Indemnification of Claims
with Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors adopt the attached resolution.
The resolution
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute
two easement agreements with Suncor; one agreement that grants an
easement to RTD for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”) project through
Suncor property in Adams County (the “Bridge Easement”) and another
agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a pipeline in
the RTD owned Boulder Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline
Easement”). The Bridge Easement requires RTD to waive sovereign
immunity to the extent it may be applicable, and to indemnify Suncor for
claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in an amount up
to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that amount
from the date of commencement of construction of the bridge and to
maintain it through termination of the Bridge Easement. RTD would
receive $10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement,
and would pay Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement. This would
result in net revenue of $9,163,580 to RTD, which would be applied to
the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF)
to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the
FasTracks Contingency Reserve for the acquisition of the Bridge
Easement. These funds would be replenished out of the $10,000,000 to
be received from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement.

6.D

Discussion:

Director James stated that this looks like a very good deal.
Staff stated that Suncor approached RTD with a price since
they are trying to build the pipeline. In addition to them
paying RTD we are able to get an easement through their
property. Director James asked about sovereign immunity.
Marla Lien stated that RTD is subject to sovereign immunity
and under state law there are caps to items for which RTD is
liable up to $150,000 a person $650,000 per incident on
liability. Under federal law, it has not been tested against a
governmental entity such as RTD; there is liability for
passenger rail accidents for up to $200 million. RTD is
required to maintain $200 million of passenger rail liability on
its entire corridor so we will not be increasing our insurance
coverage. RTD did something similar in agreeing with Union
Pacific that as long as we have operating rights RTD would
have $400 million for insurance. A condition of this deal is
that Suncor stated that since we are going through a refinery
we are indemnifying them for our negligence only.
Director Daly asked if running a pipeline so close to the track
is safe. John Shonsey stated that the engineers feel that it is
not a risk based on the specifications and location. They kept
it 25 feet away and buried 5 feet below ground. They go
through safety precautions and do continuous testing in the
pipeline to ensure its integrity. Director Daly asked if this is a
regular practice. John stated that in this corridor there are
several similar conditions that have oil lines and gas lines.
Director Daly requested clarification about the amount stated
in the first paragraph of the discussion. It stated that Suncor
agreed to pay $10 million for the bridge easement but Director
Daly believed it should read for the pipeline easement. John
clarified that they are paying $10 million for the 15 miles
easement for the pipeline.
Director Gore also asked for clarification on the feet
information shown in the last paragraph of the Background
Section. John stated that the actual bridge is 5300; however,
we only cross the property for 2200 feet. Director Gore also
asked about far away the neighborhood property line is from
the pipeline. He knows that the corridor is very narrow. John
estimates that it is 20 feet from the property line. Director
Gore asked who is responsible for notifying the cities or the

Director Gore seconded the
motion.

6.D

Director O’Boyle asked if this is a technical solution to put the
pipeline under the tracks. John clarified that this is not under
the tracks; this is a safe distance away from the tracks. From
the engineering perspective they think it is a good and safe
position. Director O’Boyle also asked if the $10 million is
included in the fiscal budget. Staff stated that it would go
towards the expansion of the North Metro Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility if approved by the Board.
Director Hoy asked if HUD allows for pipelines to go through
residential areas. Staff stated that they think HUD allows
pipelines within 10 feet of the house. This should not be an
issue.
Director Walker asked if we know if the pipeline has been
approved in the other communities. Marla Lien stated that a
representative from Commerce City came with Suncor to
request RTD to approve the easement. Director Walker also
asked if the gravel access road is for RTD use. John stated
that it is for RTD use and it is over and above the $10 million.

Updates

• Civil Rights Division End of Year Report
Kenn Hardin stated that they will provide a brief synopsis of the different
functional areas of the Civil Rights Division. James Cook, Manager of the
Equal Opportunity (EO) Team, reviewed their responsibilities, successes in
2012 and Goals and Objectives for 2013, which include the implementation
of Employee “Sensing” Sessions. They will also integrate the EO program for
all contractors, provide training for District Management in enhanced antiliability, and will collaborate with the Education Department to create Dignity
and Respect training and workshops.
Kenn Hardin also introduced Michael Washington, Manager of the Title VI
Office. Michael stated that their major responsibility is to ensure RTD’s
compliance with Title VI. He also reviewed their successes for 2012 and
2013 goals and objectives. In 2013 they will complete the update for the
2013 Title VI Program as well as the RTD Limited English Proficiency (LEP)
plan. They will also conduct a District-Wide Title VI compliance analysis,
develop an outreach plan for Title VI and establish a Title VI Advisory Board.
Kenn Hardin introduced some members of the Small Business Office (SBO).
Adrina Gibson introduced other members of the team that will be managing
the I-225 project. She reviewed the team’s responsibilities as well as their
successes in the areas of compliance, outreach, training, and SBE
Certification Program. She stated that they have 4 contracts that can be
primed by DBEs. They also have 150 DBE and SBE companies working on
the Eagle P3 project. Mr. Christian Vigil thanked RTD for the opportunity his
company has been given through the SBO programs. Ms. Beth Krueger with
Allstate Swiping stated that they have also worked for the Eagle P3 and
other projects and appreciates what RTD has done for them; they have
received a lot of work from RTD and have increased their business almost

Kenn Hardin stated that the self-insuring program is the first in the nation
and many of the companies that have worked in these projects would have
not have the opportunity unless RTD was willing to take the chance with
them. The program follows RTD’s own monitoring system that is in place.
Kenn Hardin introduced Martell Dyles the acting program manager for the
Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) Program. Martell expressed that their
responsibilities include identifying training and resource providers, as well as
delivering pre and post-placement. Their successes for 2012 include 94%
of WIN participants retained employment 90 days after placement and 76%
of WIN participants retained employment 6 months after placement. He
introduced Ms. Ericka Franklin, a WIN participant through the Denver
Housing Authority. Ms. Franklin stated that she feels the best part of the
program has been having the training available for her and the post-training
support is also very valuable.
The WIN employees have helped as
references. Martell stated that WIN goals and objectives for 2013 include
the implementation of current FTA grant-funded training activities;
implement group development seminars for win and network partners;
coordinate with Denver Transit Operators and RTD for network partners’
orientation to transit job; finalize partner relationship with new four-year
college partners; and release RFQ and secure winning bid for tracking
software to be purchased with FTA grant funds and local match dollars.
The scorecard will adapt existing evaluation criteria to create a scorecard to
message WIN’s programmatic successes and impact on the regional
economic development.
They also provided the contact information for the Civil Rights Division staff.
Director Gore requested more detail about the increase on the evaluation
scoring to 25%. Adrina explained that typically on the evaluation criteria
participants would get by with 10% and being able to increase it to 25% is
a big step.

100% over the years. Adrina stated that this program will also be in the I225 project and some of these firms will be transitioning to I-225. Their
goals for 2013 include the SBO open house, Subcontractors Performance
Self-Insured Program (SPSP) information events, and training workshops on
business development. Staff talked about their efforts on the Eagle P3
project. The team will develop orientation workshops for Prime Contractors
DBE/SBE and also the communications plan for model Prime Contractors
DBE/SBE. Staff will hold a tour for SBO education. They will implement
DBE/SBE graduation and inter-governmental initiatives to answer the
questions that the community has.

Director Cohen stated that he is very excited and encouraged to see the
department take shape and structure. He commended Kenn Hardin and the
rest of the team for what they have done in the two years the division has
been in existence.
Director McMullen stated that it was difficult at the beginning, and there
was a lot of controversy. He also mentioned that DBE is a federal
requirement and SBE is what RTD has done beyond the law. He stated that
this has been a wonderful experience and congratulated the team.
Director Bagley asked what the community outreach includes in the different
areas. Kenn Hardin stated that RTD established MOUs with 3 particular
groups: Hispanic Contractor of Colorado, the African American Leadership
Group and the Minority Chamber of Commerce. They have used these 3
groups over the years to outreach the minority contractors. They host
annual event with those key stakeholders. When RTD has large contracts
come out those groups review the contracts and goals and provide their
feedback about the goals. That does not mean that RTD will change the
goals but may try to incorporate the feedback. RTD also participates in a
number of contracting events throughout the region. As RTD has contracts
coming out, staff monitors the contracts and counts the number of contracts
that go out to ensure that we are getting the necessary participation. They
also have the prime contractors host open houses, like on the Denver Union
Station redevelopment project. They held an open house to have small
contractors see the available opportunities. They send out notices, are
connected to governmentoutreach.com, and invite people to come in and
have the project managers explain what the project is about and how to bid
on the project. Director Bagley stated that it sounds like this is very robust
initiative to keep the community involved.
Director Malpiede asked about the DBEC program. Kenn Hardin stated that
the Disadvantage Business Enterprise Committee (DBEC) opens resources for
the small business and banking institutions to come to a quarterly meeting
and see what is happening at RTD and what opportunities are available.
They invite the key project managers to explain what is on the horizon.

Director Gore also asked how the scorecard for WIN would impact regional
economic development. Staff stated that they will reach out to the
community in order to be able to give back to the community and help them
grow through the opportunities created. GM Washington stated that this is
to track the impact of the program on the communities that RTD is in. They
originally set 5 areas to track, such as Crime rate in the zip code, foreclosure
rate, unemployment in the areas where we have participants of WIN. This
data will help to leverage funding not just from FTA but other agencies
because of the impact of the program.

6.E

Director Tobiassen expressed appreciation for the DBE community
certification program. He asked where the project offices are for Adrina
now that she is the Compliance Officer for the I-225. Adrina stated that
they are currently at 707 17th Street while their floor is getting renovated.
They will also have a project office at I-225 which is in construction.
Director Tobiassen requested Adrina Gibson assist with a visit they have
planned to the I-225 area.
Director Anderson asked if this office is connected with any of the different
chambers of commerce for Jefferson and Adams Counties. These chambers
really represent small and disadvantage businesses. Ken Hardin stated that
they are already working with those chambers. Adrina Gibson stated they
email all the different Chambers so they have the information about
upcoming projects, meetings, etc. They request that the Chambers submit
the information to their constituents. Staff asked Director Anderson if she
has a specific contact to have them contact the Civil Rights office directly.
Director Deadwyler stated that she is very excited in terms of what is
happening and how all these things are coming together. She met with a
construction group and it is good to see that they have hope and optimism
for what is happening. She thanked Kenn Hardin for being at that meeting
so he could share information and work with this group to help them obtain
work. She is very proud that RTD will be able to achieve this vision.
Director Malpiede thanked the Civil Rights Division and requested the change
of the committee name from the DBE Committee to the Civil Rights
Committee. She attended the last DBEC meeting and was excited to see
how many people were present. The staff is beyond exemplary and they
want to bring to the Board the faces of the people that are participating in
the program. She thanked Kenn Hardin and the staff for all their hard work.

Recommended Actions

• Approval of Contract Extension - Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
Contract
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to award a month to month contract
extension to Idea Integration for an extension for the amount not to exceed
of $76,000 to provide Graphical Information Systems (GIS) consulting
services. The contract is being brought to the Board because it is a Personal
Services contract per RTD Resolution No.27, Series of 1985.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion
to move this to the full Board at
the December 18, 2012 Board
meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Trent Ratcliff explained that this is a month to month contract
that can be cancelled at a month’s notice. This is a short term
contract to fill an identified need until a full time employee can
be hired.
Director Tobiassen noted that the month to month contract
was not to exceed $76,000. He asked how many months
that amount would cover. Trent stated this would cover
about 4-5 months. Director Tobiassen commented that this
sounds like a very low amount of money for the level of
expertise and utilization. Trent explained that we would be
using this in a part time capacity to keep the cost down.

Director Gore stated that if he took the 600 billable hours and
divided that by 4 months and 4 weeks he comes out with
37.5 hours per week. He said that does not sound like a part
time job but that it sounds like a full time employee. Trent
explained that the contract is for a certain number of hours
and a not to exceed amount. He stated that the contract
could go 6 months or 4 months but staff wanted to make sure
to not exceed a certain dollar amount as per the Board
resolution for personal services contracts. When employees
do work off hours the contract does allow for us to pay them
overtime or off hours pay so that is why the hours are not
adding up to part time work.
Committee Chair James Declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

Updates

• Bond Rating Agency Update for Sales Tax Revenue Bonds Series 2012A
Terry Howerter began by introducing our Senior Underwriter on the deal,
John Moellenberg from RBC and from our Financial Advisor Group, Jason
Simmons. They can be available for questions as well. He explained that
we went out to three agencies and requested a rating for our 2012A sales
tax bonds that we are in the process of issuing.
Brenden Morgan shared that the rating agency presentations were held in
the RTD offices in November for Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch.
Each of these agencies were asked to provide a rating for the 2012A sales
tax revenue bonds that the District is in the process of issuing. The ratings
assigned to the bonds by all three agencies affirmed the ratings of previously
issued parity FasTracks revenue bonds and the TIFIA Loan. Those ratings
were Standard & Poor’s AA+, Moody’s Aa2, and Fitch’s AA. All three of
those ratings were assigned a stable outlook.
Brenden explained that while reviewing the credit ratings for the credit
bonds, Fitch took a global look at RTD’s outstanding debt. They concluded
that the planned issuance of the series 2012A revenue bonds would

6.F

Director Anderson asked if staff had any concern about the downgrade and
if there are steps we can take to improve that rating for the future. She
expressed concern about the downgrade if and when we have to go out for
bonds again. Brenden stated that it is never a great feeling when you see a
downgrade but the credit rating is still right in the middle of the investment
grade range so it is not too concerning. He said that this will have an
impact in the future if we do issue future COP’s. Terry Howerter stated that
we can improve our rating by increasing our revenues and that will reduce
the pressure on our net revenue test. That was one of the items that Fitch
looked at heavily.
Director O’Boyle asked what the practical impact would be from Fitch’s
downgrade. Brenden explained that the impact of this rating change would
be for any future COP issuances that the district may have at today’s market
conditions a change of around 20 basis points; so our interest rates would
go up by about 20 basis points. Director O’Boyle asked if the rates would
go up only on COP issuances. Brenden stated that was correct; the revenue
bonds were affirmed at the previous ratings.
Director Bagley pointed out the statement made by Fitch reading: “However,
Fitch notes that the planned COP issuances may result in diminished margins
above RTD’s minimum 1.2 times (x) net revenue coverage requirement for
all debt obligations.” He asked if that should read below, not above.
Brenden stated that Fitch does mean above. They are stating that our net
coverage ratio wills stay above our mandated 1.2 times coverage ratio. He
explained this means it will diminish from where it is now but will still remain
above our minimum threshold.
Director Bagley shared that he and Terry Howerter had a conversation about
the implications for COP purchases of bus fleets, etc. He asked Terry to
provide the Board with information about what the COP downgrade might
mean for those types of purchases in the future. Terry Howerter stated that
the primary effect is what Brenden mentioned; in today’s market conditions
we would have about a 20 basis point increase for new COP debt issuance.
Terry said that we may not be doing a COP issuance for our Bus Rolling
Stock in 2013; this may be done with a COP issuance or we may look at
other financing methods as well. The cost would be between $120 to $205
million dollars. Terry explained this would mean a little higher cost for the
debt but as Brenden said we are still in the middle of the investment grade.

Packet Pg. 50

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 11, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

necessitate a downgrade of the outstanding COP’s. The rating changed
from AA- with a Stable outlook to A+ with a Negative outlook. This new
credit rating for the COP puts the COP rating right in the middle of the
investment grade range.

6.F

Terry informed the Board that if we started to push the 1.2 times revenue
test it could result in a higher interest rate and a different rating as well.

Director Walker asked if the ratings are standardized. Brenden stated that
they are not. Director Walker asked why Fitch decided to take an overall
global look at our outstanding debt and the other agencies did not. He also
asked if the other agencies would review this at a later date. Terry
Howerter stated that as to the why he would have a hard time addressing
that. He explained that looking at this on a high level, we asked all three
agencies to rate our sales tax bond issue and we told them in 2013 we
would be issuing Certificates of Participation. Terry said that we informed
the agencies that we would invite them back at the time we were ready to
move forward with that debt issue. Terry believes that Fitch looked at the
sales tax bond issue and based on the flow of our sales taxes and revenues,
the payments on our sales tax bonds come off the top, which leaves
whatever falls through as a lesser amount. Terry stated that Fitch thinks we
will get closer to the 1.2; he believes we will definitely push the 1.2 in a few
years. However, staff will manage to that 1.2 so staff is not very concerned
at this point from the finance department. Terry said that the other two
agencies have not told us that they will take this step but when and if we go
out for another COP issue he believes they will all take a hard look at RTD
very closely.
Director McMullen asked on the scale how far many notches our rating went
down. Brenden said we moved down one notch.

• Third Quarter 2012 Performance Measures
Jannette Scarpino highlighted that goals 1.1, 3.3, and facilities maintenance
complaints in 2.1 have all improved from Quarter 2.
Director O’Boyle noted that on page 3 of the report, section 2.1, the
numbers are higher in 2012 3rd Quarter than 2010 and 2011 but the
footnote says the trend is continuing downward. Jannette explained that
the trend is continuing downward for the 2012 Calendar Year. The average

Packet Pg. 51

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 11, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Daly asked if Fitch is considered more conservative than the other
rating agencies. Terry Howerter explained that the rating agencies have to
be very open and transparent. He stated that we are rated about the same
with S&P and Fitch; the S&P downgrade came in 2010. Jason Simmons
explained that in this particular case, Fitch was the only agency that took a
broader look at sales tax and COP. He believes they are all just following
suite.

6.F

Director O’Boyle noted another disconnect on page 5 of the report, section
3.3, Veolia’s miles between road calls. The number of miles between road
calls for 3rd Quarter 2012 is lower than the previous two years. Director
O’Boyle also noted the correlation between the age of the fleet and miles
between road calls except with Veolia. They have a fleet age right in the
middle but are at the bottom of mileage. Jannette explained this is a similar
situation. In the 2nd Quarter their mileage between road calls was only
20,000. Bruce Abel explained that RTD has worked with Veolia to institute
some changes; we have been tracking their performance since we
implemented the changes and it appears the trend of improvement is
continuing.
Director Daly commented that he knows in the past we have had some
problems with accidents, especially with contractors. He understands one
of the reasons for the on bus accidents and complaints is from the strollers
being brought onto the busses. He recently read that the San Francisco
Municipal Transportation Agency started a public relations campaign aimed
and young mothers on busses to educate them about safely riding with
strollers. He asked if this was something we were might consider doing.
Bruce Abel stated that the bus operations team has had conversations with
marketing about this. It is anticipated that some outreach with the
community will happen in Quarter 1.

• October 2012 Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod began by highlighting that every statistic on the dashboard is
green this month. He stated that as the Board might recall, ridership was
down 6.6% in September. This was due to the issue with there being fewer
weekdays in September 2012 than September 2011. Doug explained that
in October we had the opposite situation. Typically we do about 330,000
boardings on a weekday, 170,000 on a Saturday, and 120,000 on Sundays
and holidays. Doug stated that based on these numbers you can really see
how just a few days difference in where the month falls can make a
significant difference in our percentages. For the year-to-date we are still
tracking at about 1.2% improvement level. Revenue service boardings are
up 2.9%.
Doug stated that fare revenue was up 10.7%. About half of that is due to
the additional boardings that we recorded. Year-to-date we are up 4.9%.

Packet Pg. 52

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 11, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

number of facilities maintenance complaints in the 2nd Quarter was 18.2 and
in the same 18 range for the 1st Quarter.

6.F

Director O’Boyle and Committee Chair James commented on Fitch’s
statement from the Bond Rating Agency Update that RTD has a history of
optimistic sales tax revenue projections. Based on the 10.4% increase we
have seen in the past two months it seems Fitch’s comment is an
observation from some time ago. Terry Howerter agrees that when Fitch
says we have been overly optimistic it goes back to 2004 and 2005 but at
that time no one could have forecasted the recession.
Committee Chair James asked if we have had any conversation with CU
Leeds about these sales and use tax numbers being significantly over their
projections. Terry Howerter stated that we will have a new CU Leeds
projection on December 14. He thinks it will be interesting to see what they
are projecting for 2013. Terry believes that with CU Leeds quarterly
updates they are tracking very closely.

Doug highlighted that for October we came in at 10.4% over last October
for sales and use tax. In September we were up 10.4% as well. He
explained that staff thought that was a correction from the previous month
that came in low at 5.6%. On a year-to-date basis we are up 8.4%. Staff
is forecasting through the end of the year based on 8.7% forecast from CU
Leads that we will receive $451 million versus $415.2 million last year.
Doug said that to put this in context of where we have previously been, in
2007 we received $418 million. This is the first year in five that we have
exceeded the $418 million mark.

Recommended Actions - Unanimous Consent
Motion:

Director O’Boyle made the motion
to move the five items to the
December 18th Board meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Director Bagley asked if these are perpetual agreements of if
there is a deadline for them. Bruce Abel stated that the
agreements are for one year only. The service performance
will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if
performance expectations have been met and if continuation
of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will
be evaluated according to RTD’s service standards. Nothing in
the documents obligates RTD to renew or extend the
agreements.

Director O’Boyle asked why they call the Englewood shuttle
the “Art Shuttle”. Bruce Abel stated that is how it was
branded by the parties involved.

Committee Chair Tobiassen declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

Recommended Actions

• Contracted Fixed Route Services 2012 Year End Budget Transfer
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize a budget transfer from the purchased
transportation service and fuel line items of the “Group 21” budget to the
“Group 23” budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of
adjustments to service levels associated with runboard service changes in
2012.
The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $350,000
($200,000 for service, $150,000 for fuel).
Motion:

Director Anderson made the
motion to move this item to the
December 18th Board meeting.
Director McMullen seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel stated that effective with the 2012 runboard
service changes, RTD made adjustments in the number of
service hours in all the private contract fixed-routes services.
The changes made to Group 21 and 23 resulted in a higher
than expected increase in service hours in the Group 21
contract and lower than expected decrease in the service
hours in the Group 23 contract. There is no financial impact,
the Group 21 service contract has budgeted dollars available
to be transferred into the Group 23 service contract in order to
provide additional funding needed for this service contract.

Information
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into a contract for the development and implementation of an
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for paratransit (Access-a-Ride) and
fixed-route information with Enghouse Transportation LLC for a contract
amount not to exceed $829,393.
Motion:

Director Malpiede made the
motion to move this item to the
December 18th Board meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel stated that this project crosses departmental lines.
The goal of the project is to enhance the efficiency of the
services provided by simplifying business process integration,
increasing flexibility and providing efficiency gains in network
hosting. This technology enables interaction between a caller
and a computer via the telephone. This will provide better
operations for Access-a-Ride and Telephone Information
Center. It will allow calls to go out 10 minutes before the
Access-a-Ride vehicle arrives to the customer’s location.
Director McMullen asked if this is activated by GPS. Bruce
responded that the 10 minute notice is activated by the GPS
system.
Director Daly stated he is concerned about the advertising
with the “MyStop” message. Bruce Abel introduced Beverly
Scott from IT who is the project manager for this project. She
explained that there is a cost for the text messages; however
this will allow RTD to offer the service at no cost to the
customer. She explained that the first 90 characters will be

the information about their stop and the rest will be the
advertisement. This is only for the text messages. There are
other agencies that are using this. Bruce Abel clarified that
there are not advertisements on the ADA components of this
project. Director Daly stated that as long as it is only for text
it is okay for him.

Director McMullen stated that he supports the revenue
enhancement whether on rail advertisements or
advertisements in text messages.
Director Tobiassen asked if Access-a-Ride users will be able to
make reservation through this new system. Larry Buter stated
that the system has the capability but it’s not incorporated at
this point. He also stated that current hours for Access-a-Ride
service reservations are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 7 days a week.
Director Tobiassen also asked what is going to happen after
the first year. Beverly stated that there are different options
but could not provide costs for them at this point. Director
Tobiassen asked for information on the timeline for the
project. Beverly expects to start in January with a finish date
of August and they will provide status reports.

• Award Contract to Supply Sixty-Five (65) HVAC Units (Including Spares) to
Replace the Existing Units on the SD100 Light Rail Fleet.
It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a solesource contract to Siemens Industry, Inc. Rail Systems, based in
Sacramento, California to supply sixty-five complete HVAC units. These

units will be used to replace the units currently installed on the SD100 Light
Rail Fleet.
Motion:

Director Daly made the motion to
move this item to the December
18th Board meeting.

Discussion:

Austin Jenkins stated that RTD currently operates 49 SD100
Light Rail cars. The refrigerant used in these HVAC units on
the first 31 vehicles is being phased out due to EPA regulation
changes and will not be available for purchase. This purchase
will make all HVAC units the same and will offer fleet wide
component interchangeability and compatibility.
Siemens has presented a very attractive quote for the HVAC
units; this includes Frames, inverter units and freight for all
sixty-five (65) not to exceed $4,615,000.00.
Director Hoy asked what type of refrigerant is being replaced
and who will own that refrigerant. He stated that this is a
very valuable commodity especially if it is not manufactured
anymore as other companies would buy it to use it in their
units. Austin stated that they will have to explore to see who
owns that refrigerant. He told the Board he would get that
information to them.
Director Daly asked if this is grant money. Austin stated that
the funding for this contract is part of the 2013 budget.
Director Tobiassen asked if this will require a different power
supply. Austin stated that these are DC units.

Updates

Director Gore seconded the
motion.

6.G

Bruce Abel stated that staff will be covering several cost share agreements that are
within the General Manager’s authority of $250,000. They do not require Board
action but staff wants to keep the Board informed.

• A-Line Cost Share Agreement

This is to enter into an agreement with Ride Provide to provide RTD support
for the A-Line operations. This agreement is for the calendar year 2013 and
shall not exceed$173,891.00. The Board of Directors in February 2003
approved the discontinuation of services on the skyRide Route AS beyond
the Stapleton transfer station due to low ridership.
The A-Line was created to fill the void left by the elimination of Route AS
service to Arvada. Ride Provide operates the A-Line service and has six
vans, 22 employees, and provides services between Arvada and DIA.
Funding for this was included in the 2013 budget.

• Cost Share Agreements Under $250,000
No action required. This report provides information regarding cost share
agreements that are within the General Manager’s authority of $250,000.
Bruce stated that these include the Littleton Shopping Cart, a free service
available to the residents of Littleton, the Focus Points Family Resource
Center (FPFRC), and the Longmont Coordination of Services to provide
services in Longmont for 2013.
Director Bagley asked what the subsidy for the Focus Points Family
Resource Center is per passenger. Staff stated that currently it is at $9.88
per passenger, which is half of what it used to be.
Director Gore asked if RTD educates the community about the subsidies
they receive. He mentioned that based on his experience, educating the
public helps to increase public donation. He believes it is important for the
general public to understand that the cost is more than what they pay.
Bruce stated that they work with the stakeholders but there is not donation
rate at this point. GM Washington stated that they will start an outreach in
2013 to the communities with information about the subsidies.

Director Daly stated that looking at the Federal Heights ridership it is below
RTD’s standards. He asked if Federal Heights is paying for that service.
Bruce stated that they have received a federal grant with some of the other
municipalities; they pay the local match and RTD does not contribute any
money other than staff time. Federal Heights has done some marketing,
specifically with some grass roots efforts. Bruce noted that this service was
introduced this year. This is the 10th month of operation and they
anticipated needing to have one year of service under our belt before we do
a serious evaluation.
Director McMullen asked if service had begun for the Tech Center and
Belleview. Bruce stated that they started at the same time as Federal
Heights in January and service is funded through a 3 year grant. Director
McMullen noted that Lone Tree is still lagging and asked if this is due to the
fact that it is more residential. Staff stated that it is more residential. Staff
has talked to the contractor and they are talking to the drivers about how
they can promote the service. Director McMullen asked how we notify the
people that the service is available. Bruce mentioned that there was a major
grand opening at Belleview with IKEA sponsoring it. The Transportation
Management Organization has been instrumental; they performed
transportation fairs with many of the corporations in the area and they are
working on one for January. They have been a great asset.
Director Hoy asked what the minimum ridership required is to maintain
service. Staff responded that the minimum is 3 but they would like to see a
better performance of 3.5-4 to be considered healthy. Brian Matthews
explained that 3 riders does not mean that they will keep the service but it’s
the minimum required. Director Hoy mentioned that Federal Heights is in his
district and he has been talking to the Mayor and the City Council people to
have them promote the service. He thinks we will have a dilemma in a
couple of years when they want to continue service and it does not meet
any standards.
Director Bagley asked why the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride seems to be
more robust in 2012. Staff stated that it is due to the school children.
They continue to put the word out. Highlands Ranch is contacting the
schools to make sure they are aware of the service. There are many
children with special needs in the community who use the service.

• Third Quarter 2012 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary

Director O’Boyle stated that it would be useful to have some statistical
information comparing previous years to this year with the new fare
enforcement policy. Commander Bob Nicholson stated that we are reporting
20% more tickets on average. Dave stated that as we get more time with
the new law being enforced we will provide some more statistical data to
the Board.
Director McMullen would like to see RTD collect the money from the fares or
fines instead of the local jurisdictions. He mentioned that in Dallas the
agency sends a notice that if the fine is paid in advance they get a discount
and the agency collects the money. Dave mentioned that Dallas and other
agencies are doing that and RTD is looking into it. We are waiting to see
how the change from a criminal to a civil violation affects it.
Director Bagley mentioned that he receives a lot of questions about the
number of fare evasion on the light rail. There is a need to have information
for the Directors, some kind of fact sheet that will help them address those
questions. He stated that it would be valuable to know what the
percentages are, trends, etc. Dave stated that staff can put together a one
page fact sheet addressing those questions. Director Bagley stated that it
will be appreciated as we are going to open the new lines and that will
probably generate more inquiries.

• Third Quarter Report Paratransit Services
Bruce Abel explained that ridership is up more than the revenue hours due to
an increase in productivity. Paratransit Services continue to operate under
budget, which continues the trend over the last couple of years. Looking
back to 2005-2006, revenue hours were growing as much as 7%-10% per
year. As we have moved into a program that promotes the cab services, we
can carry more people more efficiently. Since 2008 the growth in revenue
hours in the van services has been essentially flat. We have been able to
accommodate the increase in ridership by having more people ride the cabs.
When we take the gasoline prices out of the cost structure, we have the
same cost per rider since 2008 which is lower than in 2007. We continue
to work with the Access- a-Cab and Access-a-Ride. The cost has gone
down from 2008.

David Genova stated that the report is included in the packet. He stated
that this is the 3rd Quarter report so when talking about the off duty police
officers it only includes Denver. Aurora will be included in the 4th Quarter
report.

6.G

Director Tobiassen asked what types of complaints are received with regards
to Access-a-Cab. He is not seeing any data on complaints for this service.
Larry Buter shared that we have staff calling a percentage of passengers
that took the Access-a-Cab the day before to inquire about their experience.
If there is a problem the customer is asked to contact the cab company. If
the situation is not resolved then we will step in on behalf of the customer.
Director Tobiassen asked if we use any wheel chairs accessible cabs. Staff
stated that the cab companies are realizing that they need to increase their
wheel chair accessible vehicles. They do have some accessible vehicles.
Director Tobiassen asked if there is a study that indicates how it would
benefit RTD if they have more wheelchair accessible vehicles. Staff stated
they would look into that. One of the challenges is that the vehicles are
owned by individual operators. These operators often have customers call
them routinely to schedule appointments and do not have any open
appointment spaces.

• Third Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis
Bruce Abel stated that the update is included in the Board packet. He
reminded the Board that a couple of years ago they discussed the increase in
complains related to fair policy enforcement. We set a goal and we continue
to operate at that level and they exceed the requirement. Bruce explained
that when we investigate complaints, some are valid and some are not.
Right now there is not means to separate valid from invalid complaints when
reporting to the Board and staff would like to have that conversation with
the Board. He stated we use the CAD/AVL to pinpoint a bus location when
we receive complains.
Director Daly asked why the “Discourtesy/Operator” category is so high.
Bruce stated that this is the category where fare disputes are recorded; he
does not know if that is part of the cause. Staff does play backs and works
with the operators to improve their customer service skills when a complaint
is found to be valid.
Director Hoy asked if drivers have a business card or something that
customers can use to identify the driver. Bruce stated that they do not have

Packet Pg. 64

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 11, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

GM Washington stated that this is something that we have talked about,
how we are being innovative. We are bringing down the cost of paratransit
service, which is an issue all over the country. Bruce stated that we
continue to look at ways to improve the quality of services and manage the
project because this is an important part of our overall services.

6.G

RTD provided cards. Riders can ask for their names or call in and provide
the bus number, time and route and the operator can determine the name of
the driver.

Director Tobiassen stated that the 330,000 boardings a day and an average
of only 1600 complains per month shows a very remarkable performance.
He thanked the staff, especially Mike Gil, for their prompt response.

• Third Quarter Report Fixed Route Contracted Services
Bruce Abel stated that the update is included in the Board packet.
Director Tobiassen asked if there is a new provider for Access-a-Ride. Bruce
stated that Verizon is the new name for CUSA. He also asked about the
complaints regarding some of the Access-a-Ride vans that were purchased.
Staff stated that those complaints are not tracked separately from other
complaints. Bruce noted that this was a pilot; we have 12 of these shorter
vehicles that were originally going to lead to a total purchase of 90. The
manufacturer has been advised that the purchase will not go through. We
are testing some new vans that are slightly larger.

• Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location
(CAD/AVL) Project Status Update
Director Gore asked what the original timeframe was for CAD/AVL. Eric
stated that it was supposed to be completed by the end of the year. This
means they are about 6-7 months behind schedule.
Director McMullen asked what the installation problems are. Eric stated that
the contractor had estimated 8 hours for each installation and it is taking 1624 hours. The contractor did do some retraining of their installers and there
seems to be some improvement. Eric hopes by next month to have a better
idea of the improvement.

• Smart Card Project Status Update
Packet Pg. 65

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 11, 2012 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Malpiede asked why there was such an increase in the numbers for
the “Bus Did Not Show” and “Bus Late” categories. Bruce stated that
complaints about the bus being late mirror the on-time performance. This is
a result of the service cutbacks that happened at the beginning of 2012.
We have experienced a decrease in on-time performance and we are to
address the poor performing routes.

6.G

Bruce Abel stated that they have two items, one is the update included in
the packet. The second is a demo for the current and new Board members.

Director Tobiassen asked how many people with disabilities have tested this
system. Gary stated that they will have the National Federation of the Blind
doing a field demo this coming Friday. Wheelchairs are not an issue based
on the placement of the machines. The biggest issue is the visual impaired
users and he expects some feedback from them after the demo on Friday.
They are meeting at 2:00 p.m. at the Mineral station.
Director Bagley stated that he is really excited to see the Smart Card project
move forward and thanked the staff.

V.

Other Matters
Dave Genova informed the Board that he has an update on the security contract.
John Tarbert mentioned that we just finished the RFP process for renewing the
security contract. These contracts are always 3 years with two 1-year extensions;
we are finishing the last extension with G4 S. We received 3 responses to the
RFP. The committee that reviewed the technical qualities of the responses included
John Tarbert, John Perry, Bob Nicholson, an Aurora Sargent, a Denver Sargent,
Mike Gil and Bill Bell. They did the technical scoring and then met with Linda Wells
who did the cost evaluations. The technical aspect is 50% of the evaluation and
the cost factor is the other 50%. The technical evaluations were very close. The
cost proposal was the highest from G4. The new company is Alley Barton. Dave
stated that the contact transition will occur on February 1st. He explained that it is
a very common industry practice for the new company to retain the officers that
have already been in place in the current contract. Ally Barton has put together a
transition package for the officers that he is very happy with.
Phil Washington mentioned that they will see a different uniform and they will have
additional officers due the new lines but otherwise the transition should be
unnoticeable.
Director McMullen mentioned that he is satisfied with this.
Director Tobiassen expressed that he thought the current company was very
professional and will be interested in watching the transition.
GM Phil Washington updated the Board about the rail accident that occurred this
morning. A pedestrian was walking on one of the fly overs and was trespassing.
He was side swiped by the light rail and disappeared. He showed up at Mariposa
facility later and was transported to the hospital. At this point there is no
information about why he was there, but it seems that there were no life threating

December Board Meeting Agenda Review
General Manager Washington provided a quick review of the order of the meeting
for Tuesday, December 18, and asked if there were any questions pertaining to the
unanimous consent. Under the recommended action, he noted that his team has
tried to meet with all of the Directors individually to address any concerns or
questions on the moving forward: filling the FasTracks Internal Savings Account.
Director Tayer stated he appreciated the effort of staff to reach out to the Board
and asked if all of the Board members had been contacted included the two who
had voted no at the committee. Director Deadwyler responded that she had one
primary question related to the sun setting of the rubber tire service. General
Manager Washington responded that what staff has said is they will keep this
flexible enough that if challenges arise, they will come back to the Board. Director

2. Identify a set of criteria that will address the sunset concerns
Director Cohen stated that he has a comfort level with the proposed RAM that it
does provide the flexibility needed based on market conditions.

General Manager Washington noted that item B, resolution regarding easement
agreements and indemnification of claims with Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc had been
moved from unanimous consent to recommended action due to a change in the
language in the background to add a 10” pipeline running for approximately 1000
feet from Brighton Blvd. to East 66 Avenue in Commerce City. Director Bagley
requested that the staff provide a couple of pieces of information in anticipation of
possible questions from the Board: what will be in the two pipes and the
separation of the two pipes. He asked that staff is prepared to speak to other
similar easements and how they have been handled.
There were no other changes to the December agenda.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to
approve the agenda for the December 18
Board meeting to include the change
indicated.

Recommended Action
Moving Forward: Filling the FasTracks Internal Savings Account
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the eight, highest
value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the Risk Allocation Matrix
(RAM). Any funding realized through these activities will be tracked separately and
added to a new budget account, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
The status of the FISA will be reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly
basis, and the FISA will be incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan
and Annual Budget. Expenditures from the FISA will be subject to Board approval,
with the staff recommended project goals identified below in the Background
section of this report confirmed as the current RTD Board project goals for the
FISA.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following
activities:
1. Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system
operations at the rate of inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index
(CPI):
 Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;
2. Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction
milestones have been reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant
funding has been received and RTD has better information on the growth of
sales and use tax:
 Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;
3. Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from
three to two months:
 Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;
4. Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation
– complete once funding is identified for the entire project:
 Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;

Packet Pg. 72

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Dec 13, 2012 2:00 PM (Committee Reports)

It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a sole-source contract
to Siemens Industry, Inc. Rail Systems, based in Sacramento, California to supply
sixty-five complete HVAC units. These units will be used to replace the units
currently installed on the SD100 Light Rail Fleet.

5. Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under
contract:
 Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;
6. Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
 Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;
7. Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current
level of 2.5%:
 Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;
8. Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and
provide RTD with parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure
exemptions are the same for both RTD and the State in all cases). Establish
this as RTD’s number one legislative priority. Begin working immediately
with government relations staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other
stakeholders to initiate and support the introduction of a bill(s) on these
topics during the 2013 legislative session:
 Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.
Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the
FasTracks capital program through the establishment of the FISA with a goal of
achieving $300 million by 2017. It is anticipated that these eight highest priority
opportunities alone could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million by 2017.
The Board directs staff to continue working to identify other funding opportunities
through the RAM analysis process in 2013 for potential Board consideration at a
later date.
Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements and Indemnification of Claims with
Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors adopt the attached resolution.
The resolution authorizes the
General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute two easement
agreements with Suncor; one agreement that grants an easement to RTD for the
North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”) project through Suncor property in Adams
County (the “Bridge Easement”) and another agreement that grants an easement
to Suncor to construct a pipeline in the RTD owned Boulder Industrial Lead
(“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”). The Bridge Easement requires
RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable, and to
indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in
an amount up to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that
amount from the date of commencement of construction of the bridge and to
maintain it through termination of the Bridge Easement. RTD would receive
$10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement, and would
pay Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement. This would result in net revenue
of $9,163,580 to RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the

Special Recognition
The Board and General Manager Washington recognized Jim Jacobson and his staff at the

serious situation. Director Cohen stated this was incredible action and the team worked
together like a smooth and well-oiled machine.

IV.

Public Participation


Katie Witt, member of the Longmont City Council, who was representing NATA
expressed general support for the approach to the risk allocation matrix (RAM) but
expressed needing more clarification on (1) what jurisdictions and amount above the
current 2.5% level have been contributed from local sources and (2) information on
how the projected $127M for the sales tax audit has been calculated. She expressed a
desire by NATA to participate in this sales tax audit/parity discussion. She also
expressed a desire by NATA that these funds are allocated to the north/northwest
corridor.



Howard Gelt, also with NATA, reemphasized the desire that in the interest of equity
parity, the monies from the RAM should be allocated to the north.



Gene Putman, Transportation Planning Manager for the City of Thornton, stated that
he supports the comments made by Katie Witt. They are in general support for the
RAM but need further discussion related to: increase in local match above the 2 ½%;
What others have contributed in this process; and trying to get to 104th versus the 72
Street that RTD has proposed. He stated that sadly RTD is not on time nor on budget.



Walter Isenberg with USA expressed appreciation to the RTD staff, particularly Marla
Lien and her negotiation skills for the approval of the lease of the Denver Union Station
Historic Building. He thanked the Board for their confidence and trust to them to be

Chair Kemp introduced the newly elected Board members and asked each to share
information on their priorities:
o

Gary Lasater, District G—He is a Parker resident with over 17 years as an

Natalie Menten, District M-Unavailable

o

Dr. Claudia Folska, District E—Claudia expressed her ongoing interest in public
transportation and that she has spent considerable time looking at various

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 28, 2012

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2012

Subject:

Approval of the Purchase of Six Electric
Multiple Units (EMU) Vehicles for the North
Metro Rail Line

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve the purchase of six Electric Multiple Units (EMU) vehicles for the
North Metro Rail Line through the Denver Transit Partners (DTP) Rolling Stock Option in accordance
with the EAGLE Concession Agreement (CA) Section 31.1, for an amount not to exceed $24 million.
Funding to purchase two of the vehicles is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North Metro
Corridor project.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to transfer $16 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to
the North Metro Corridor project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU vehicles.
BACKGROUND
Final design for Phase 1 (DUS to 72 nd Avenue Station) of the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL) is
underway and construction for the first 2.5 miles from DUS to the National Western Stock Show
(NWSS) is funded. RTD is actively pursuing avenues to secure the funds for the next 3.5 miles from
NWSS to 72 nd Avenue with the intent of building Phase 1 as a continuous construction package.
Construction of the 2.5 mile segment from DUS to NWSS is scheduled to be completed and ready
for revenue service in 2017. A single two car train is required to operate from DUS to NWSS with
30 minute headways. An additional four vehicles are needed to provide 30 minute headways to 72 nd
Avenue.
The EAGLE CA anticipated the purchase of the North Metro fleet and included an option that allows
the purchase of no less than 8 and no more than 24 additional Cars (the Rolling Stock Option Cars).
The CA allows us to exercise the option up to 24 months prior to the scheduled delivery of the last
base car. Based on the current revised baseline schedule, that date is approximately February 2013.
DISCUSSION
The Eagle CA only allows for a minimum purchase of eight vehicles. DTP is willing to allow RTD to
exercise the option in the EAGLE CA for the reduced number of cars provided that the request is
authorized before December 20, 2012. The vehicles will be identical to the Eagle vehicles and will
share the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF). Identical vehicles will all ow for interchange
of vehicles and parts.
The cost estimate included in the 2012 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) for two EMU vehicles was
$8,020,000. This price assumed a purchase of between 15 and 30 vehicles. The cost for a
manufacturer to mobilize to produce such a small order would greatly exceed that price if a
manufacturer could even be convinced to bid on such a limited order.

Packet Pg. 89

11.A

If RTD were to purchase only two vehicles now and look to buy the additional four vehicles after
funding is secured for the segment to 72 nd Avenue the cost is estimated to be, at a minimum, in
excess of $6 million per vehicle.
We recommend exercising the option of purchasing six cars through the EAGLE CA because the
price is reasonable, allows for interchangeable parts with the EAGLE fleet, and continues to show
forward movement in taking concrete steps toward to goal of completing the full build out of the
NMRL.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the purchase of two vehicles is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North
Metro Corridor project. Funding for the purchase of the remaining four vehicles would be provided
through the recommended transfer from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve. Staff will investigate
additional funding sources to replenish the FasTracks Contingency Reserve at a future date.
Payment for each Rolling Stock Option Car shall be made by RTD to the Concessionaire in
accordance with the payment schedule noted in CA Section 31.1(i).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the purchase of six
Electric Multiple Units (EMU) vehicles for the North Metro Rail Line through the Denver Transit
Partners (DTP) Rolling Stock Option in accordance with the EAGLE Concession Agreement (CA)
Section 31.1, for an amount not to exceed $24 million. Funding to purchase two of the vehicles is
included in the 2013 Adopted Budget for the North Metro Corridor project.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to transfer $16 million from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve to
the North Metro Corridor project budget to fund the purchase of the additional four EMU vehicles.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the North Metro Rail Line approach. This is
not recommended as RTD does not have another avenue to purchase EMU vehicles identical to
EAGLE Fleet. This alternative would delay operations from DUS to NWSS and negatively impact the
effective implementation of the FasTracks North Metro Rail Line.

Disposition Plan for Excess Land in Ft. Lupton,
Weld County

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173 square feet (1.84 acres) net of county road
right of way located at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort Lupton, Colorado and further authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute a contract for the sale of the property.
BACKGROUND
The Agreement Regarding Engineering Design and Railroad Property Acquisition by and between Union
Pacific Railroad Company and the Regional Transportation District dated January 25, 2007 contemplated
an acquisition of UPRR sites in Denver, Fort Lupton and Brighton and a relocation of UPRR to Weld
County. The Agreement provided that in order for the FasTracks Project to proceed on schedule and to
avoid delays, it would be necessary and desirable for the UPRR to purchase, or purchase options for,
certain Relocation Sites prior to the completion of negotiations on the Final Agreement between the
parties. Pursuant to the Agreement, RTD paid UPRR 100% of costs, fees and expenses incurred by
UPRR related to the identification of, due diligence on, and purchase and ownership of six properties in
Weld County and one property in Denver County. RTD determined that is was not feasible to proceed
with acquisition and relocation of UPRR facilities and therefore according to the terms of the Agreement,
UPRR assigned or transferred to RTD the properties at no additional cost to RTD.
Resolution No. 8, Series of 2008 Concerning the Sale of Property Acquired by the Regional
Transportation District from the Union Pacific Railroad was adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on
May 20, 2008 and provided that property acquired by the District from the UPRR pursuant to the
January 25, 2007 Agreement and not needed by the District for mass transit purposes would first be
offered to its original owners at the price paid by the UPRR plus direct expenses related to the transfer
of the property, and if not reacquired by the original owners on those terms would be marketed to obtain
the best price for the District. The owner of the property subject to this Board Action was notified of
the option to acquire the property back. The owner chose not to acquire the property at that time.
The subject property consist of a one story 3,688 square foot, single family residence which has been
substantially vandalized with two other vacant auxiliary houses and a small shed on 1.84 acres of
former residential property. Zoning of the property is I-2 (Heavy Industrial District) by the Town of Fort
Lupton.
DISCUSSION
An unsolicited offer to acquire was received on the property. An appraisal report was completed by an
independent appraiser, Sue Ann Foster, MAI, Foster Valuation Company LLC. Ms. Foster concluded an
opinion of the fair market value of the fee-simple interest in the subject property of $135,000 or 80,173
square feet at $2.25 per square foot ($180,389) less demolition costs of $45,000.

PROPOSED DISPOSITION PLAN: In accordance with Resolution No. 10, Series of 1984, Joint
Development and Disposition of Property Rights, the General Manager find that the RTD owned property
known as 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort Lupton, Colorado Is not needed for transit use.
The appraisal report established a fair market value for the property. Mr. Robert Villano, Authorized
Manager of Villano Brothers Properties, Inc. represented by Mr. Peter G. Gunderson, Larry A. Cornell and
Mr. Bob Bruce, Esquire has agreed to enter into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the appraised value.
The property will be sold “as is-where is”.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive the purchase price at closing. The proceeds will be assigned to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors approve the proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173
square feet (1.84 acres) net of county road right of way located at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort
Lupton, Colorado and further authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and
execute a contract for the sale of the property.
2. Do not approve the proposed Disposition Plan for excess land for the 80,173 square feet (1.84
acres) net of county road right of way located at 13215 Weld County Road 8, Fort Lupton, Colorado
and further authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute a contract
for the sale of the property.

Approval of Contract Extension - Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a month
to month contract extension to Idea Integration for an extension for the amount not to exceed of
$76,000 to provide Graphical Information Systems (GIS) consulting services. The contract is being
brought to the Board because it is a Personal Services contract per RTD Resolution No.27, Series of
1985.
BACKGROUND
The contract was awarded to Idea Integration in 2010 following a competitive bid of four submitted
proposals and candidate interviews. Idea Integration is a certified Environmental Systems Research
Institute's (ESRI) Corporate Consultant.
RTD provides mission critical GIS enterprise systems that must be maintained and continually enhanced.
GIS skilled consultants maintain the systems allowing 24x7 access to RTD’s critical GIS information
assets. These systems require ongoing maintenance and operations activities to ensure application
integrity and reliability. For example the GIS systems database contains the base maps used by the
Trapeze scheduling applications to plan all of RTD routes as well as for our new trip planner, parking
management, and CAD/AVL system. Without GIS development contract support, RTD would not be
able to operate and advance current public applications and systems.
DISCUSSION
This contracted support is critical for the on-going GIS administration of GIS System Map applications,
West Corridor Web Map, Internet Trip Planner, Parking Management System, FasTracks System Maps
and Trapeze interfaces. GIS will play a key role in establishing requirements for “real time” information
applications with the new CAD/AVL system. With an increase in GIS needs, this resource was approved
to be sourced as an internal employee. The contract provides a part time fixed level of weekly support
as well as 24/7 on-call resources to address critical failures until the new position is filled.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to the District for the extension of contracted GIS services from Idea Integration for 600 billable
hours over a four-month period will not exceed $76,000. Sufficient funding has been included in the
Information Technology 2013 expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES

11.C

1. Approve the option to extend the contract for part time GIS Consulting Services. This is the
recommended action for the following reasons:
 Enables IT to maintain the current level of GIS Administration in support of Parking Management,
Internet, and Service Planning and Scheduling critical operations.
 Positions IT to move forward with required GIS applications to support future mobile and real time
applications, an improved trip planner, automated stop announcements, our new CAD/AVL
system, Fastracks and West Corridor GIS needs.
2. Do not approve the GIS Consulting Services part time contract extension. This is not the
recommended action for the following reasons:
 Capacity to adequately support the application production operations may be severely
compromised. RTD may need to reduce the 24/7 requirement for support.
 West Corridor on-line web maps would not be available to the public.
 Without key and unique skills that are not available through staff may possibly diminish the
functional performance level of the GIS and associated systems.
 Compromises the ability to configure new GIS systems and maintain compliance with GIS servers
for security and upgrades to the GIS development tools.
 Defer future upgrades and additional applications services until such time that IT can prioritize
current and future GIS project demands.

Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter
into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the
operation of the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University
of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2013 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,459,589.00.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,764 passenger trips per weekday.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $1,459,589.00 in 2013.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the cost
sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it
appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will confer
on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service
through 3rd Quarter in 2012 resulted in 27.4 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP passenger
trip of $1.62. The subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2011 ranged from an average of
$2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.12 subsidy per passenger for
suburban local service and an average of $4.96 subsidy per passenger for regional service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the HOP service were included in the approved 2013 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

DRCOG Vanpool Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement
is for calendar year 2013 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $730,000.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
on marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.
RTD financial support is used to help to underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans in service grew from 11
to 99 vans.

Packet Pg. 99

11.E

In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool
program. VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Over the next few years, VPSI
will phase out the DRCOG owned vehicles with leased vehicles. Since taking over the program the
number of vanpools has declined. Currently there are 97 active vans. The number of vanpoolers per
vehicle, however, has risen. In 2009, the vanpool program had a 63% capacity; in 2010, 93%; in 2011
and 2012 the number has stabilized to 81%. VPSI has held the vanpoolers more accountable in covering
costs of their individual vanpools. This in turn has resulted in more vanpoolers in each van.
DRCOG vanpool performance through the 3rd Quarter in 2012 resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger
trip of approximately $1.87. The subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2011 ranged from
an average of $2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.12 subsidy per
passenger for suburban local service and an average of $4.96 subsidy per passenger for regional service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the CRCOG Van pool program were budgeted in the approved 2012 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool service in order to continue
to provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area
who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG RideArrangers vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

North Front Range Vanpool Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the North Front Range Metropolitan Planning Organization (NFRMPO) to provide RTD
support and expansion of the NFR VANGO vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This
agreement is for calendar year 2013 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $425,000.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are

As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the NFRMPO VANGO vanpool program since 2003. The program targets long
distance commuters who live in Northern Colorado and who travel to the Denver metropolitan area. Of
the vans in operation, 75% provide service in the RTD district. The RTD subsidy is based on vanpool
travel within the RTD district. The vanpool program had been limited by perceived high fares, insufficient
funding for van acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary
marketing activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the NFRMPO entered into a
partnership in 2003 to expand vanpool service coming into the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so,
RTD and NFRMPO believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting
shared goals of offering desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality
in the Denver metropolitan area. RTD financial support is used to help to underwrite the vanpool pricing
structure in order to make vanpool fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By
subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived
as a more attractive alternative for area commuters. In addition, RTD’s support is used to provide
incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling
stock to provide vanpool services. In return for this funding NFRMPO provides RTD with National
Transportation Data. This data is included in the NTD numbers reported by RTD and used by the Federal
Government to determine the amount of federal funding allocated to RTD. Since the advent of RTD
support for the vanpool program in late 2003, the number of vans serving the Denver metropolitan area
has grown from 28 to 58 vans.

Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2013 and is for
an amount not to exceed $297,000.00.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circular bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was a free service. In September 2007, with the
expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood
continues the management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing
and related expenses. The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of
Englewood. The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art
shuttle charged a RTD fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 843 boardings per day or 31.3 passengers per hour.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $297,000 in 2013.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through 3rd Quarter in 2012 resulted in 31.3 passengers per hour and
an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.31. The subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route
service in 2011 ranged from an average of $2.62 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an
average of $7.12 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $4.96 subsidy per
passenger for regional service. The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art
shuttle.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2013 RTD budget. Nothing

Cost Share Agreements MAP 21 -5311

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding
agreements with Via Mobility of Boulder and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial
support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County, Adams
County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2013 and for amounts not to
exceed $335,298.00 for Boulder County, $300,000.00 for Adams County and $102,248.00 for
Jefferson County.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU),
along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized, or
rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions will be administered under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP21). Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the
provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for
federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided financial
assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since
1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Boulder
County in an amount not to exceed $335,298.00 in 2013. RTD shall also contribute funding to Special
Transit to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in amount not to exceed
$330,000.00 in 2013.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $102,248.00 in 2013.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.
If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected party(s) will
confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311 service in 2012
(current numbers available) resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.9 to 2.2 passengers
per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.66 to
approximately $3.79 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). RTD Call-n-Ride monthly
performance averaged 4.8 passengers per hour in 2011 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at
approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger
boarding of $15.44 in 2011 while access-a-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger trip of

Packet Pg. 105

approximately $55.87 in 2011.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2013 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility and Seniors’ Resource Center so
that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the nonurbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Contracted Fixed Route Services 2012 Year
End Budget Transfer

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the “Group
21” budget to the “Group 23” budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of adjustments
to service levels associated with runboard service changes in 2012. The total dollar amount of the
budget transfer is $350,000 ($200,000 for service, $150,000 for fuel).
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with two (2) different service providers, First Transit and Veolia
Transportation, to provide fixed route transit services under four (4) service contracts. First Transit
operates the “Group 20” (Commerce City), “Group 22” (Longmont) and “Group 23” (Denver) service
contracts. Veolia operates the “Group 21” service contract.
DISCUSSION:
Effective with the January 2012 runboard service changes, RTD Service Planning & Scheduling made
adjustments in the number of service hours in all of the private contract fixed-route service contracts
as a result of the District-wide reduction in service. The adjustments that were made to the Group
21 and Group 23 contracts resulted in a higher than expected increase in service hours in the Group
21 contract and a lower than expected decrease in the service hours in the Group 23 contract.
Consequently, Veolia (Group 21) was left scrambling to hire additional drivers and First Transit
(Group 23) was faced with the prospect of laying off drivers. RTD agreed to adjust service hours
with the May runboard to bring both contracts closer to service hours that should have been
implemented based upon the percent of overall service reductions that were made in January. At the
present time, the Group 23 service hours have been increased to a level slightly higher than the
hours used to estimate costs for the 2012 budget and the contract will run short of funding by the
end of the year. Conversely, the Group 21 service hours have been reduced below the level used to
estimate costs for the 2012 budget. Therefore, it is recommended that the excess budget dollars in
Group 21 be transferred to Group 23 to provide the additional funding needed for this service
contract for 2012.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. The Group 21 service contract currently has budgeted dollars available
to be transferred into the Group 23 service contract.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for
Group 23 service through the end of 2012.
2)
Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will
require staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Group 23
service.

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System for
Paratransit and Fixed-Route Information

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the development and
implementation of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for paratransit (Access-a-Ride) and fixedroute information with Enghouse Transportation LLC for a contract amount not to exceed $829,393.
BACKGROUND
The introduction of an Interactive Voice Response System (IVR) for both the Telephone Information
Center and Access-a-Ride began in part, to enhance the efficiency of the services provided by
simplifying business process integration, increasing flexibility, and providing efficiency gains in network
hosting. IVR is the technology that enables interaction between a caller and a computer via the
telephone. Callers can interact with IVR systems by pressing numbers on a telephone keypad or by
speaking simple commands to answer the computer's voice prompts. IVR technology is most commonly
found in the call centers of companies seeking to improve their customer service, reduce costs, and
expand their call center operations.
Enabled by the successful Proposer, and tightly monitored by RTD staff, IVR will provide:
Access-a-Ride
Intelligent call routing which will allow passengers to reach the right agent every time
Integration with internal application, RouteMatch, to improve call center operations
Expanded ability to get feedback from passengers with surveys that populate our database from the
proposed IVR solution
Reduce idle time in our call center with outbound campaign management
Automated response to “where’s my ride” inquiries
Next day trip reminders
Vehicle arrival reminders
Public announcements
Access-a-Cab processing
Telephone Information Center
Expand the Telephone Information Center’s ability to serve the Districts Customers by offering a texting
“MyStop” option to answer next bus questions.
Allow Customers to build an individual profile allowing easy access to the information they select.
Add a survey option that will allow RTD to query our Customers.
Comprehensive administrative tools and system reporting tools allowing us to maximize the IVR
functionality and to use the data collected to track system performance.

Packet Pg. 109

11.J

Include an advertising component to each text MyStop message allowing RTD to offer this service at no
cost to the Customer or RTD.
The advertising component could potentially develop into a revenue source for RTD.
The benefits of IVR are endless. RTD cannot remain competitive in terms of providing expected
customer service if we do not possess the tools our riders need. Other than on a case-by-case
exception, Access-a-Ride passengers have been advised that it is their responsibility to be ready for their
vehicle at the commencement of their 30-minute pick up window. One of the key benefits of the IVR
system will be the automated process of contacting passengers and giving them notice of the impending
arrival of their vehicle. This will eliminate the need for passengers to wait, sometimes at an
inconvenient location or outside, for up to 30 minutes for their vehicle to arrive. Not only will this
culminate in improved customer service, but it is highly probable that our on time performance will
benefit. Currently, the Access-a-Ride Call Center reserves, schedules, and dispatches over 2700
passenger trips each day. The telephone communications associated with these passenger trips
consume an extremely high amount of resources. The IVR, integrated with our scheduling software,
RouteMatch, will allow us to proactively manage our daily service delivery. The ability to automate
routine calls such as, “Where’s My Ride” inquiries, next-day trip reminders, vehicle arrival reminders, and
the automated processing of Access-a-Cab trips will provide Call Center personnel more time to deal
with calls requiring more detailed interaction. Conducting automated phone surveys will keep us abreast
of trends which may need modifying, and automated public announcements will help keep customers
better informed about Access-a-Ride service. The introduction of IVR to Access-a-Ride will be a
significant technological improvement to the program and will ultimately improve both efficiency and
customer service.
The Telephone Information Center (TIC) has used technology to assist the Customers of the District
while maintaining a static headcount. In 2002 the TIC received 2,289,535 calls. In 2012 the TIC had
its first 5,000,000 call year and 2013 will also exceed 5,000,000 calls. RTD’s existing IVR technology
has been a major contributor to this increase. The addition of a Texting capability will expand our ability
to provide information to our Customers and allow us to reach a new demographic who have grown up
with texting. It will provide operators more time to assist those Customers who have complex route and
scheduling inquiries by further reducing the next bus inquires received by the TIC.
We will also offer our Customers the ability to customize their IVR interaction by selecting a list of
favorites allowing them to ask for information for a stop that they have preselected or that the IVR has
recorded from their past call history.
Finally, the system will also have the ability to survey our callers giving us the ability to check the quality
of the service that our Customers receive when calling the TIC as well as allow RTD to query our
Customers on subjects that are important to us.
DISCUSSION
Three proposals were received in response to RFP 12FH002 for the Interactive Voice Response System
for Paratransit and Fixed-Route Information. Proposals were received from Enghouse Transportation
LLC, LogicTree Corporation, and Unified Dispatch (UDI). The proposals were reviewed by an evaluation
team that consisted of Joe Berdaus, Sr. Manager, Customer Information; Larry Buter, Manager,
Paratransit Services; Carolyn Conover, Sr. Manager, Contracted Services; Beverly Scott, Program
Manager, Information Technology; and David Terada, ITS Systems Administrator. The evaluative criteria
established for this procurement were 1) experience of the team and experience providing proven, similar
technologies (35%), 2) cost (35%), 3) demonstrated understanding of the project (10%), 4) project

approach, including proposed warranty/system support (10%), and 5) project implementation (10%). It
is the recommendation of the evaluation team that RTD award a contract for the IVR system for
paratransit and fixed-route information to Enghouse Transportation LLC.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the
three proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the
evaluative criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Experience”, “Understanding
of the Project”, “Project Approach” and for “Project Implementation.” Based on the average of the
individual scores received in these categories, LogicTree was the highest rated technical proposal
followed by Enghouse. UDI was the lowest rated technical proposal. The score for the “Cost” element
of each proposal was calculated by the RTD procurement staff and was then added to the technical
score of each proposal to determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores
resulted in Enghouse being the highest rated proposal followed by LogicTree. UDI was the lowest rated
technical proposal and the highest cost proposal. It was the consensus of the evaluation team that
Enghouse presented the best value for the District in terms of the combination of the technical proposal
and the proposed price.
RTD has required that the IVR system be fully functioning, tested and in operation within 180 days from
notice to proceed. Based on the timeline for approval and contract award, it is anticipated that the IVR
system will be operational no later than August, 2013.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost for the IVR system is $829,393, which includes hardware, installation and configuration. The
on-going operational costs, without the ad sharing, are approximately $28,000 (price per text based on
500,000/year). Funds for the IVR system are included in the 2012 capital budget. Future year
expenses will be budgeted as needed for on-going operational and maintenance costs in the Information
Technology budget.
A grant will assist in covering $496,925 of the proposed amount.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Award the contract to Enghouse Transportation LLC, as recommended.
2. Do not award a contract. Return the grant money and defer the project. Opportunity costs for
enhancing the rider experience will be deferred. Implementation costs may need to be fully
funded by RTD if grant money is not available in the future.
3. Develop the technology in house. The cost would be equal to or higher and would defer other
projects currently planned. The implementation would be pushed into 2014 or later.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 3, 2012

From:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 28, 2012

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2012

Subject:

Award Contract to Supply Sixty-Five (65)
HVAC Units (Including Spares) to Replace the
Existing Units on the SD100 Light Rail Fleet.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to award a sole-source contract to Siemens Industry, Inc. Rail Systems,
based in Sacramento, California to supply sixty-five complete HVAC units. These units will be used to
replace the units currently installed on the SD100 Light Rail Fleet.
BACKGROUND
The RTD currently operates forty-nine SD100 Light Rail Cars. This was the first model of vehicles
purchased in four orders for our light rail service. The refrigerant used in these HVAC units on the first
thirty-one vehicles is being phased out due to EPA regulation changes and will not be available for
purchase within the next few years. These units were built by another vendor and have been a
maintenance problem for quite some time including a fleet failure situation where Siemens stepped in to
honor the warranty that another vendor had rejected. This purchase will make all HVAC units the same
and will offer fleet wide component interchangeability and compatibility. Salt Lake City (UTA) replaced
similar ones within the first two years of operation.
DISCUSSION
We have received a very favorable quote from Siemens for HVAC, Frames and Inverter units, which
includes freight, for all sixty-five (65) not to exceed $4,615,000.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract is part of the 2013 budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for this HVAC system procurement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to award a contract to Siemens Industry, Inc. Rail Systems to
build and supply sixty-five (65) HVAC units. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the award of the contract and solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result in a substantial delay in the acquisition of the HVAC equipment may result in substantially
duplicated costs (R & D) since there are no other suppliers for these units.

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2012

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff
to move forward with implementation of the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified
as part of the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Any funding realized through these activities will be tracked
separately and added to a new budget account, the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). The
status of the FISA will be reported to the RTD Board of Directors on a monthly basis, and the FISA will
be incorporated into the FasTracks Strategic Budget Plan and Annual Budget. Expenditures from the
FISA will be subject to Board approval, with the staff recommended project goals identified below in the
Background section of this report confirmed as the current RTD Board project goals for the FISA.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:
1. Beginning in 2014, increase FasTracks funding to support base system operations at the rate of
inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI):
 Estimated to contribute $24 million to the FISA by 2017;
2. Reduce FasTracks Minimum Unrestricted Fund Balance once construction milestones have been
reached, the majority of the Eagle Project grant funding has been received and RTD has better
information on the growth of sales and use tax:
 Estimated to contribute up to $72 million to the FISA by 2017;
3. Reduce FasTracks Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Fund Balance from three to two months:
 Estimated to contribute $10 million to the FISA by 2017;
4. Defer Southwest Corridor Extension Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) relocation – complete once
funding is identified for the entire project:
 Estimated to contribute $9 million to the FISA by 2017;
5. Work to achieve project underruns on FasTracks projects currently under contract:
 Estimated to contribute $15 million to the FISA by 2017;
6. Sell or lease RTD properties, where possible:
 Estimated to contribute $20 million to the FISA by 2017;
7. Request stakeholders to increase financial participation above the current level of 2.5%:
 Estimated contribution – To Be Determined;
8. Work with legislature to allow RTD to audit sales and use tax receipts and provide RTD with
parity with the State on sales tax exemptions (i.e., ensure exemptions are the same for both RTD
and the State in all cases). Establish this as RTD’s number one legislative priority. Begin working
immediately with government relations staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to
initiate and support the introduction of a bill(s) on these topics during the 2013 legislative
session:
 Estimated to contribute up to $127 million to the FISA by 2017.

Packet Pg. 115

12.L

Approval of the opportunities listed above will have a positive impact to the FasTracks capital program
through the establishment of the FISA with a goal of achieving $300 million by 2017. It is anticipated
that these eight highest priority opportunities alone could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million
by 2017. The Board directs staff to continue working to identify other funding opportunities through the
RAM analysis process in 2013 for potential Board consideration at a later date.
BACKGROUND
Over the last several months, RTD staff has developed a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) that identifies
specific cost saving/revenue enhancing opportunities that, if enacted, would result in additional nearterm funding for the FasTracks program (i.e., by 2017). For each of these opportunities, staff has
identified the associated level of risk to the District and presented this risk assessment to the RTD Board
on November 13, 2012 for their consideration. All funding identified through the process will be added
to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) until enough funding is accumulated to complete and
operate additional projects. Staff has identified the following project goals for 2017, and this confirms
the RTD Board’s concurrence with these goals at this juncture:




Completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project;
Construction of North Metro to at least 72nd;
Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially-funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion).

Ultimately, future RTD Board policy actions will be required to determine what projects will be funded,
and when, through the FISA.

DISCUSSION
On November 13, 2012, staff presented the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified
as part of the RAM. For each of these opportunities, staff identified an estimated contribution to the
FISA by 2017 and a level of risk. The following table summarizes the information presented to the RTD
Board in November:

In addition to the opportunities identified above, RTD staff has identified the following additional RAM
items that will be discussed with the RTD Board of Directors in the future:
 Aggressively pursue additional federal loans/grants and potential loans from public/private sector;
 Request stakeholders apply DRCOG financial commitment to base projects rather than
enhancements;
 Adjust frequencies/span of service on rail lines;
 Conduct life-cycle reviews to balance short-term capital and long-term O&M needs;
 Minimize scope changes once projects enter final design/construction.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of the eight, highest value, recommended opportunities identified as part of the RAM will have
a positive impact to the FasTracks capital program through the establishment of the FISA. It is
anticipated that these opportunities could fund the FISA up to or exceeding $277 million by 2017.

• Benefits of allowing RTD to audit sales & use tax include:
– Not increasing sales or use tax, just better enforcement of existing tax
levels
– The State is currently understaffed, and may not have the resources
available to ensure vendors are paying taxes appropriately
– If RTD can use a third-party for auditing, the company would not
charge RTD directly, but would be paid from the additional sales and
use tax receipts collected
– Positive impacts to the Base System as well as FasTracks

• Consistently applying exemptions between the State and
RTD could simplify the tax collection process for vendors

General Overview Questions
• FAQ: What is the impact to the base system if there is a
significant economic downturn before 2017?
– The cost saving/revenue enhancing measures would have little to
no impact to RTD’s base system. The majority of the measures
apply only to FasTracks.
– Should a significant economic downturn occur that impacts the
base system, a future RTD Board could mitigate impacts to base
system operations through the following:
o Accessing management reserves to backfill the need, and
keeping the FISA whole.
o Transferring funds from the FISA to maintain base system
service levels (within the constraints of the FasTracks adopted
plan) and reducing the FISA accordingly.

Attachment: Board_Pres_12_4_12_RAM FAQS_FINAL (1406 : Filling the Internal Savings

12.L.b

• FAQ: Can RTD expend funds from the FISA prior to 2017?
– Future RTD Board policy actions will determine the timing and
purpose for withdrawing funds from the FISA.
o Funds for many of the measures are not assumed to be fully
available until 2017 (e.g., reducing the FasTracks Minimum
Unrestricted Fund Balance from $150 M).

– Staff recommends not withdrawing funds from FISA until accumulated
balance enables provision of a significant component of the short-term
project goals.

• FAQ: Will the FISA be included in the next SB 208
submittal to DRCOG?
– The financial plan provided with the SB 208 report will list FISA as a
fund balance account. The FISA will not be assumed to fund
additional projects until the RTD Board takes a formal policy action.

General Overview Questions
• FAQ: What impact will these measures have on the
DBE/SBE community?
– Enactment of these measures would benefit the DBE/SBE
community. Approval could fund additional FasTracks
projects up to or exceeding $277 M by 2017. Adding funds
to the FISA increases opportunities to receive additional
contracts with RTD to construct FasTracks projects.

1. Evaluate FasTracks Funding for
Base System Operations

• FAQ: What did the original FasTracks plan assume for
FasTracks funding of base system operations?
– The original 2004 FasTracks plan assumed an increase in base bus
service levels of 1% per year between 2006 and 2020 and 1.5% per
year between 2021 and 2025.

Attachment: Board_Pres_12_4_12_RAM FAQS_FINAL (1406 : Filling the Internal Savings

12.L.b

– FasTracks funding for base system operations is drawn from the 0.4%
FasTracks sales and use tax approved in 2004.

• FAQ: What would happen if the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) is negative in any given year?
– RTD would assume 0% growth in the FasTracks allocation to base
system operations for any year with a negative CPI.

• FAQ: Could you please provide an updated graphic of the
total impact to the base system out to 2020?

1. Evaluate FasTracks Funding for
Base System Operations
• FAQ: How much is the savings related to the total
funding for base systems operations?

– Over the five-year period, the cumulative reduction would be $24 M,
less than 1.5% of base systems operations. The transfer to the FISA
would be limited to that amount.
– The RTD Board always retains the option to suspend the allocation,
or to transfer previously allocated funds back to the base system.

• FAQ: Does this measure have a sunset? Will it remain in
effect through 2025 or some other date?
– The decision to adjust FasTracks allocation to base system
operations only defers the commitment in the short-term to
accelerate construction of additional FasTracks projects. The full
allocation will be restored to base system operations when
financially feasible.

Sales and use tax forecast is from the CU Leeds School of Business.
17% collection improvement is a conservative estimate of the increase in tax collections
from auditing and improved reporting. Third party vendor estimates range from 15-30%
for this item.
Exemption parity with the state results in a net increase in collections.
Assuming RTD’s proposed legislation for exemption parity would be in effect in 2014 and
audit collections in effect in 2015.
Packet Pg. 164

• FAQ: What does “parity with the State” mean?
– RTD would request legislation to ensure that any items taxed by the
State of Colorado are also taxed by RTD. For example, Colorado
currently collects sales and use tax for sodas and candy, while RTD
is precluded from collecting these taxes.
– Treating RTD and the State of Colorado consistently would simplify
tax collection process for vendors and the Department of Revenue.

• FAQ: If RTD is successful in implementing this
measure, would it be applied retroactively?
– If approved, RTD would work closely with government relations
staff, lobbyists, legal counsel and other stakeholders to further refine
this measure, including specific timeframes of applicability, etc.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 14, 2012

From:

Richard F. Clarke Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 28, 2012

Board Meeting Date: December 18, 2012

Subject:

Resolution Regarding Easement Agreements
and Indemnification of Claims with Suncor
Energy (U.S.A.) Inc.

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt
the attached resolution. The resolution authorizes the General Manager or his designee to negotiate
and execute two easement agreements with Suncor; one agreement that grants an easement to RTD
for the North Metro Rail Line (“NMRL”) project through Suncor property in Adams County (the
“Bridge Easement”) and another agreement that grants an easement to Suncor to construct a
pipeline in the RTD owned Boulder Industrial Lead (“BIL”) right of way (the “Pipeline Easement”).
The Bridge Easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the extent it may be applicable,
and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the Bridge Easement in an amount up
to $200 million and to purchase general liability insurance in that amount from the date of
commencement of construction of the bridge and to maintain it through termination of the Bridge
Easement. RTD would receive $10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement,
and would pay Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement. This would result in net revenue of
$9,163,580 to RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility (CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Boa rd of Directors
authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve for the acquisition of
the Bridge Easement. These funds would be replenished out of the $10,000,000 to be received
from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement.
BACKGROUND
In December of 2011, Suncor approached RTD with a request to purchase an easement from RTD to
be used for the installation of a new pipeline (the “Pipeline Project”). The Pipeline Project consists of
construction a 16-inch crude oil pipeline system, running from Wyoming to Commerce City, Colorado
and a 10-inch pipeline running for approximately 1,000-feet from Brighton Boulevard to East 66 th
Avenue in Commerce City.
In 2009, RTD purchased the Boulder Industrial Lead (BIL) from the Union Pacific Railroad for the
purpose of using the corridor to construct and operate the NMRL. Suncor would like to use a portion
of this right of way for the 10-inch and 16-inch pipeline. The requested Pipeline Easement would be
parallel to but lateral from the future NMRL tracks.
The Pipeline Easement is approximately 15 miles long and 20 to 30 feet wide, starting on the north
side within Section 36, Township 1 North, Range 68 West in Weld County and proceeds south to

Packet Pg. 168

12.M

Section 7, Township 3 South, Range 67 West in Adams County. The Pipeline Easement parallels the
NMRL from beyond the end of line station at 162 nd Avenue to south of the 72 nd Avenue Station, at a
minimum lateral distance of 25-feet away from the centerline of the nearest track which will not
interfere with the use and maintenance of the NMRL. The 10-inch pipeline is located in the south
end of our BIL right of way in an area not used by the NMRL.
RTD agreed to negotiate granting of the Pipeline Easement contingent on Suncor granting RTD the
bridge easement for the future NMRL that will run through the Suncor property on an elevated
structure requiring an aerial easement approximately 5300 feet long by 24 feet wide. RTD also
requested that Suncor include provisions for a gravel access road.
DISCUSSION
The price to be paid by Suncor for the Pipeline Easement is $10,000,000. The easement was
appraised by David B. Clayton, Certified General Appraiser for Suncor Energy Services, Inc. The
property was appraised under two valuation techniques, commonly known as Across the Fence and
Across the Fence Plus Corridor Enhancement Factor and is based on several “extraordinary
assumptions. The appraisal was reviewed for RTD by Integra Realty Resources, Houston, Texas and
signed by Michael W. Welch, Principal and Certified General Real Estate Appraiser, Brad Weiman,
MAI, Managing Director and John P. Baker, MAI. The review concludes that Mr. Clayton’s use of
the methodologies used is an acceptable means of valuation that is recognized by industry peers,
published treatise and acceptable standards and in general agrees that the value of the easement,
$4,031,930 is reasonable. Through negotiation, Suncor has agreed to pay $10,000,000 for the
pipeline easement and to make a onetime payment in the amount of $500,000 to be used toward
installation of the gravel access road.
Engineering plans for the Pipeline Project have been reviewed by RTD’s engineering staff to ensure
compatibility with the NMRL. Submittal of final plans is expected in December 2012. Final sign ing
of the Pipeline Easement is contingent upon final approval and acceptance of the Suncor’s
construction plans by the RTD engineering staff and final approval of the form and substance of the
Pipeline Easement Agreement.
The current estimated value of the bridge easement is $836,420 based on an appraisal prepared by
David B. Clayton for Suncor. The appraisal will be reviewed for RTD when received from Suncor.
Final signing of the bridge easement is contingent upon RTD review and acceptance of the appraised
value and final approval of the form and substance of the bridge easement Agreement.

As noted in the Resolution, the bridge easement requires RTD to waive sovereign immunity to the
extent it may be applicable, and to indemnify Suncor for claims arising out of RTD’s use of the
bridge easement. Suncor is also required to indemnify RTD for claims arising out of Suncor’s use of
the Pipeline Easement in an amount to be determined based on RTD risk management review. RTD is
required to maintain $200 million of passenger rail liability on its entire corridor due to federal and
freight railroad requirements and so will not be increasing its level of insurance cov erage to benefit
Suncor. Suncor has requested it be required to insure RTD at a level commensurate with its pipeline
coverage in other corridors.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the acquisition of the bridge easement is not presently included in the North Metro
budget since the bridge easement is part of the construction project from National Western Stock
Show to 72nd Avenue Station. The recommended budget transfer would provide funding for the
acquisition of the Bridge Easement, and would be replenished from the proceeds of the Pipeline
Easement when this easement is executed. In addition, the approval of this resolution would result in
a net gain of approximately $9,163,580 to the District. These funds will be applied to the cost of
expansion of the CRMF to accommodate the North Metro vehicles, as approved by the Board on
September 18, 2012.
ALTERNATIVES

purchase general liability insurance in that amount from the date of commencement of
construction of the bridge and to maintain it through termination of the bridge easement. RTD
would receive $10,000,000 from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement, and would pay
Suncor $836,420 for the Bridge Easement. This would result in net revenue of $9,163, 580 to
RTD, which would be applied to the cost of expansion of the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility
(CRMF) to accommodate the North Metro vehicles.
It is further recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the transfer of $836,420 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve for the
acquisition of the Bridge Easement. These funds would be replenished out of the $10,000,000
to be received from Suncor in exchange for the Pipeline Easement.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not agree to adopt this resolution, do not grant
Suncor the Pipeline Easement and forgo the receipt of $10,000,000; do not acquire the
easement for the future NMRL until a future date when all funding for the construction of that
project is in place. This alternative would negatively impact the effective implementation of the
NMRL as well as the cost recovery for the CRMF.

Resolution NO. ______ Series of 2012
CONCERNING GRANTING OF A PIPELINE EASEMENT TO SUNCORE ENERGY (U.S.A.) PIPELINE
COMPANY (“SUNCOR”) AND ACQUISITION OF A BRIDGE AND GROUND EASEMENTS FROM SUNCOR
AND CONCERNING WAIVER OF GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

WHEREAS, on December 18, 2012, the RTD Board of Directors authorized the General Manager
to grant a pipeline easement and related agreements encumbering RTD property on the North Metro Line
(the “Pipeline Easement”), in exchange for aerial and ground easements and related agreements
encumbering Suncor property on the North Metro Line (collectively, the “Bridge Easement”);
WHEREAS, the compensation to be paid by Suncor for the Pipeline Easement is $10,000,000,
and the compensation to Suncor for the Bridge Easement will be an amount not exceed $836,420;
WHEREAS, as a condition of granting the Bridge Easement, Suncor requires, among other things,
that RTD indemnify and hold Suncor harmless from all claims arising out of RTD's use of, and
construction on, the Bridge Easement except (a) Suncor’s punitive and exemplary damages; (b) to the
extent caused by the negligent or willful acts or omissions of Suncor; and (c) RTD’s waiver of
governmental immunity and liability for indemnifying Suncor shall be limited to $200,000,000, the
amount of RTD’s applicable insurance coverage required under the Bridge Easement;
WHEREAS, as a condition of granting the Bridge Easement, Suncor requires, among other things,
that RTD waive the right to seek to void its obligation to indemnify and hold Suncor harmless (as
described in the preceding clause) by invoking the doctrine of sovereign immunity, or for any other
reason;
WHEREAS, as a condition to granting the Bridge Easement, Suncor requires, among other things,
that RTD waive the right to seek to void, for any reason, RTD’s obligations in the Bridge Easement to
release Suncor from liability for any damage to the NMRL bridge or other RTD personal property, and to
keep the Bridge Easement property free from liens;
WHEREAS, as a condition to granting the Bridge Easement, Suncor requires, among other things,
that RTD waive the right to void, for any reason, RTD’s acknowledgement in the Bridge Easement that
RTD will acquire rights in the Bridge Easement property “AS-IS” and with all faults;
WHEREAS, the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA) limits RTD’s liability for punitive and
exemplary damages arising out of the use of the Bridge Easement;
WHEREAS, the CGIA would ordinarily limit RTD's liability for such indemnity but the CGIA allows
a government to waive immunity up to the amount of available insurance;
Now Therefore Be It Resolved That:
