### B. Citizens Advisory Committee Update

Bob Rizzuto, Co-Chair of the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC), thanked the Directors for the opportunity to present the CAC’s thoughts and receive feedback on the future direction of the CAC.  He noted that Cindy Stovall, Co-Chair of the CAC, was not able to be in attendance.

Bob Rizzuto reminded the Directors that the CAC was formed in 2005 after the approval of FasTracks to recommend ideas to the Board from the citizen’s perspective.  As the FasTracks projects wind down, he noted that Committee Chair Hoy asked the CAC to bring to the Board a recommendation on what the future of the CAC could look like.  The CAC drew feedback from its members, RTD staff, and from the Directors through one-on-two meetings held earlier in the year.

Bob Rizzuto told the Directors that the CAC proposes that the committee continues to be a body of 17 members from throughout the area, not per District.  The CAC would be committed to the District’s plan and long term vision.  The CAC would provide region oriented advice while representing the citizen’s perspective on a wide range of issues, not just FasTracks, while gathering information from the community and sharing it with the Board. The CAC would also perform any other tasks as assigned by the Board.

Committee Chair Hoy noted that as the CAC matures the focus needs to evolve and that it is important to see how the CAC could be the most effective.  He said that Roger Sherman, from CRL Associates, did a great job helping the CAC move through this process.

Director Bagley thanked Bob Rizzuto and the CAC for their efforts.  He echoed Committee Chair Hoy’s thoughts of seeing how the CAC evolves as it become active in other issues that RTD faces.  He pointed out that he spent two hours on his meeting with the two CAC members and he could tell the CAC wants to be engaged as it morphs beyond FasTracks to many other facets of operations and maintenance, relationship to the public, etc.

Director Lubow thanked the CAC for their dedicated work.  She mentioned that the Directors could not hear too much from the public.  She asked the CAC to bring back to the Board a summary of public feedback on a regular basis.

Director Francone said that the CAC is an incredible and important asset to the agency as an informed and dedicated group of volunteers.  She is glad the CAC will still be around.  She praised the CAC for their nimbleness and asked Bob Rizzuto to extend her thanks to the whole CAC.

Director James wondered if the document could be more specific.  He pointed out that the CAC could be very effective promoting better understanding between RTD and citizens.  He suggested a higher involvement of the CAC in service planning as well as strategic planning in order to provide more input and transparency.

Chair Sisk thanked the CAC.  He mentioned that the Directors would like to keep the CAC engaged in RTD as it is a benefit to the agency and the Board.  He noted that he would like the CAC to still be involved in providing input on FasTracks as well as providing input into other areas.

Committee Chair Hoy restated the importance of the CAC evolving to serve new needs.

Director Anderson said that she was in agreement with what has been expressed.  She appreciates the CAC looking into the future.  She echoed Chair Sisk’s remarks about the CAC still being engaged with FasTracks as it is not over.  Bob Rizzuto noted that the CAC is committed to see FasTracks finished.

### C. Recommended Actions

No recommended actions were presented.

#### 1. U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, introduced Svetlana Greshka, Senior Engineer for the U.S. 36 Project.  She reviewed the U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Update presentation as included in the FasTracks Monitoring Committee agenda packet for December 1, 2015.  The presentation included a general overview of the project, a detailed review of both Phase I and Phase II, a programmatic update, and next steps for the remainder of 2015 and January, 2016.

Director Folska noted that she could feel the team’s excitement through the presentation.  She asked staff to clarify the news she listened to on Colorado Public Radio regarding legislature that needs to happen in order for BRT to function.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that the Assistant General Managers knew about the issue before the end of the last legislative session; the biggest issue was to get the rest of the parties on board.  The issue is that you cannot drive or pass on a shoulder.  While the project was in process, RTD asked the Attorney General how to handle the bus on shoulder operation as part of the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA).  The Attorney General replied that the Colorado Department of Transportation designs the lanes and the sign will say “designated lane”.  RTD did not see the signs until the very end of the last legislative session.  The signs read “Bus on Shoulder”.

Marla Lien said that she immediately contacted the attorney assigned to CDOT by the Attorney General asking if legal status would be needed.  The attorney, who was very supportive, said that would not be necessary since it would be an amendment to Title 42, which is basically the operation of highways. RTD met over the summer with State Patrol, CDOT, and the Attorney General’s office.  State Patrol told RTD over email that they would not ticket RTD drivers using the shoulder; however, they do not control all the ticketing since there are also local jurisdictions.  State Patrol and the Attorney General’s office were both in favor on legislation to clarify the language; however, CDOT was not.  After multiple meetings where RTD stated that we would not operate on shoulder unless there was clarifying legislation on the legality of riding on shoulder, CDOT decided to go forward and seek legislation.  She added that staff expects a bill to be introduced in January.   Marla Lien stressed that she was not critical of CDOT’s process as she understood the political implications of such a request.

Director Folska asked Dave Genova, Interim General Manager and CEO, when the safety campaign would be launched.  Dave Genova replied that it will be launched in mid-January.

Director Bagley recalled that U.S. 36 was one of the pet projects of John Tayer, former Director for District O.  He said he is looking forward to visiting former Director Tayer in Boulder using the Flatiron Flyer come mid-January.  He is excited to see BRT, something new to RTD, be done in this era of mobility.  He echoed the message expressed in the Longmont Times-Call by Will Toor, former Boulder County Commissioner, supporting BRT for the Northwest area.

Committee Chair Hoy said that he is pleased to see this project come to fruition.  He thanked Svetlana and her team for their hard work.
