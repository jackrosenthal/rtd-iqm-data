#### 1. US 36 Express Lanes Construction Update

Nadine Lee, Project Manager of Engineering, gave the Board an update on the US 36 Express Lanes Construction as presented on page 4 of the FasTracks Monitoring/Government Relations/Planning and Development Committee Packet for June 3, 2014.  The goal of the update was to provide background, project scope, and next steps.  Since the last update to the Board, activity has centered around:

- Reconstruction of US 36

- Additional express lane in each direction

- 12-ft wide shoulders for “Bus-on-Shoulder” operation

- Bridge reconstruction

- Improvements to 12 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) platforms, including new passenger canopies

- Installation of Active Traffic Management system

- New commuter bikeway

At this time Committee Vice-Chair Lasater ceded the chairing of the meeting to Committee Chair Larry Hoy.  Chair Hoy thanked Director Lasater for starting the meeting and Nadine Lee for her presentation.

Director Menten asked if there would be any conflict on the commuter bike path between commuter riders and casual riders.  Nadine Lee replied that the commuter bike path is designed for a maximum speed of 20 miles per hour.  She said she was not sure what the posted mileage would be but noted posted mileage is usually 5 miles per hour below the design speed.  She also added the path would have 2 foot shoulders – one on each side.  Director Menten then asked if any municipalities use slow traffic signage on their bike paths to regulate traffic and avoid accidents.  Nadine Lee told Director Menten that she would do the research and provide her with the information.

Director Daly asked for clarification on the modular passenger canopies for the BRT platforms.  Nadine Lee explained the canopies are modular in design to provide for potential future platform expansion.

Chair Sisk expressed his thanks to Nadine Lee along with Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, and Chris Quinn, Project Manager for Planning.  He also thanked every staff member who has worked on this multimodal project.  He shared his excitement on the project coming together on schedule and under budget.  He congratulated the staff on their communication with the stakeholders which has allowed for better communication between the Directors and the stakeholders.

Director Hoy thanked staff on their efforts and expressed the Directors appreciation, especially those Directors whose Districts are along US 36 Corridor.  He noted the importance of the McCaslin Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI) as it is one of the first of its kind in the nation.  He inquired about its opening date.  Nadine Lee replied that she will communicate with CDOT and inform the Directors of the timeline.  She explained that the opening of US 36 will involve public education campaigns as many of the features will be new to the public.  Director Hoy noted that the stakeholders are also interested in the timeline.
