Background
• This document provides a summary of the 2018 Year-End GM Performance Evaluation for
RTD General Manager Dave Genova.
• The evaluation was completed by all 15 members of RTD’s Board of Directors between
October 17 and October 29, 2018. Each Director completed the evaluation online via
SurveyMonkey.
• The average time to complete the evaluation was 33 minutes.*
• Due to small sample sizes, counts are reported in each chart and table instead of
percentages. The sample size for each graph is denoted by the term “n=X”.

*One response was not included in this calculation as the time to complete the survey was more than 23 hours. This is
likely the result of the respondent leaving the survey open on his or her device.

Additional Comments
Thinking about the GM's performance year-to-date, what are the most significant accomplishments?
• Negotiation and execution of the new CBA. Resolution of the RRP Litigation . Managing the DTP Litigation in a restrained manner such that progress on the G Line is not held up. Navigating the
conflicting streams required in order to implement a new Pass Program.
• Getting the g line to open.
• Remained calm in the face of many disruptions and significant issues.
• The successful negotiations that led to the approval of the Collective Bargaining agreement, The settlement of the North Metro Line dispute, the successful hosting of the APTA Rail Conference.
Also the successful delivery of rail and bus services, as well as achieving the FTA certification of the Colorado's State Safety Oversight program.
• -Moving forward, against many obstacles, towards completing the A line regulatory requirements and quiet zones creation, and getting the G line into operation. -Negotiating a viable cba
contract with creative and fiscally responsible pay and working condition attributes which will hopefully address the operator shortage issue. -Actively preparing RTD to be ready to navigate the
big technological changes in mobility provision that are expected to arrive in the not-to-distant future.
• Collective Bargaining agreement with ATU.
• A successful close of the CBA

Senior leadership hires appear to be well qualified individuals

What appears to be a path to move forward with the FRA and the CPUC on the G Line

• Reaching a settlement with RRP; reducing testing hours of G Line to accommodate proximity to residences; working to remove flaggers from University of Colorado A Line.
• Securing a new union contract, reducing the number of vacant bus driver positions and getting the crossing gates fixed on the "A" Line.
• Addressing the two legal issues is excellent. Working with FRA to get the P3 fully functioning.
• I think Dave’s biggest accomplishment is negotiating a 5 year contract. Other than that feat, I think he’s done good work on the FRA/PUC issues, and hired some good new people- altho I would
have preferred that he promote from within, as he himself was promoted.
• Putting up with the board in a professional and rational manner!! While I admit to a bit of hyperbole, Dave continues to impress me as a true professional. His most significant accomplishments
are: 1. The Labor Union Contract 2. The A Line progress, which has been a result of his tireless efforts and yes staffs' efforts to reach what we hope is a final acceptance by the Federal agencies
and PUC, understanding the waiver is in place 3. The Pass Program and what an undertaking that was for which Dave, Heather, and Michael , among others deserve our gratitude and
appreciation.
• Continued dialog with FRA regarding quiet zones as well as the G line testing.Scott Reeds retirement.
• Transition of new AGMs, Mr. Jensen and Mr. Worthen The negotiation, and subsequent staffing improvements, of the CBA Turning around record lost service hours Resolve RRP claim
• I applaud his successful negotiation for a CBA with the ATU, and commitment to our employees His approach to technology transformation and attempting to take a leadership role has been
encouraging He has achieved accolades nationally (i.e., APTA) for management of the agency.

Additional Comments
What are the most significant shortcomings? What would you recommend for improvement?
•

Allowing personal criticisms by Board members--no matter how unfounded--to impact him personally. While that is a sign of a caring and sensitive person, which is to be applauded, it is nonetheless beneficial to grow a thicker skin.

•

I can't think of shortcomings considering the multitude of problems. The Gold Line is a significant problem - we will need to have a community meeting to inform residents of the current situation.

•

Even though performance of scheduled bus service has improved, it still could be better. Also. I have ome concerns over the ability of RTD to keep people informed of changes in service plans. I also hate bringing it up, but the G
Line issues need to be brought too a successful conclusion. I believe there is enough lessons learned from this process to make some changes in the regulatory processes within the State of Colorado regarding the PUC and
nationally in the FRA. Hopefully, wwe can provide some leadership for the future.

•

-Failing to complete the unfunded FasTracks corridors. Suggested improvement would be to actively work with stakeholders towards generating alternative and creative funding of these corridors, and towards coming up with cost
saving measures for easier funding. -The Agency consistently avoids addressing long term problems - such as failure to complete FasTracks or inability to curtail incessant horn noise on the A line - by communicating about these
problems with stakeholders and citizens on a regular basis. Suggested improvement would be facilitating greater interaction, such as through telephone town halls, emails, public meetings - with stakeholders and citizens, when
serious problems exist. -A difficulty in engaging the stakeholders as real partners in providing transit. Suggested improvement would be talking with the stakeholders about what a real partnership would look like, and implementing
some of the ideas as a pilot.

•

Contractural challenges with DTP and RRP( delay in North Metro project). Work on coming to an agreement with DTP that minimizes settlement monies pays to DTP. Increase work on North Metro that will make the completion
date sooner than projected completion date.

•

I am hopeful that Scott Reed's position will be filled with a dynamic, strong individual.

•

The area that needs the most improvement is communication with staff and public. I recommend describing the process you use to reach a decision (required input, timeline, analysis method, etc.) so staff and board members know
how a conclusion is reached.

•

Needs to spend more time with Directors that are not happy with his performance. The Board could be more effective if these Directors feel that their concerns are being listened to.

•

Succession plan should have COO as second in command rather than any other AGM. CFO is one individual who is both CFO and CIO and head of HR. Need to have two additional individuals to oversee those important positions.
Asking her to do all three things without compensation amounts to sexual discrimination and puts the agency at risk.

•

I think that Dave got out of an issue by Scott Reed retiring. Our biggest issue is lack of approval by our constituents- primarily our non-riders-and hopefully Dave will hire someone good and begin addressing this issue.

•

Clearly there are some board members who want Dave to interact more with them so with the new board being elected in November, it will give Dave an opportunity to reach out to the board members more frequently. Some board
members need less of the PT (Personal Time) and Dave needs to make those assessments. I also know board members can be helpful and assist Dave so it really is a two way street.

•

Access A Ride. Staff needs to update the entire system in stead of making excuses. Need new management to make changes. System need to be fair to all AccessARide riders. The definition of insanity applies. Over confidence in
dealing with DTP. Need to be prepared for the unexpected. Need to be more hands on with issues vs always depending on staff that prove to be wrong. use your COO more effectively and don’t set him up to fail. Need more visibility
in the community instead of refusing to attend evenings & weekend meetings/functions. Need to carefully evaluate service changes before cutting service.use a more appropriate successor Vs your safety friend.

•

I think it has improved lately, but communicating and resolving the details, the schedule, the hurdles of PTC technology to the public

•

I have been concerned about the communications and Public information. I liked Scott Reed, but with his retirement, there is an opportunity for more proactive communication. It is hard as a director to respond to constituents
immediate concerns without going through a somewhat bureaucratic morass.

I was very disappointed with the outcome of the Pass Working Group

• Dave actually does most of this well but RTD does a bad job of promoting from within and
employees know it. It’s demoralizing and should be addressed.

Additional Comments
Comments on the General Manager's Performance Year-to-Date.
• I feel constrained--as I always have--by the use of the phrase "exceeds expectations." My expectations are already extremely high, and so I would feel more comfortable in saying that Dave
has met my admittedly high expectations. That said, this is all done in the context of a series of metrics, where conditions are defined/identified for each category, and so I can follow that
regimen and have done so in providing my answers.
• Community outreach falls short for the A-Line and G-Line. The citizens have given up. We will need to go to their communities instead of relying upon them to search it out. They will
appreciate the update though they may yell at us but that's part of the job.
• I appreciate Mr. Genova's accomplishments in the face of some daunting circumstances. His overall performance is one of outstanding accomplishment. I also like his appreciation of the
future of transit transportation and his willingness to work with other organizations and providers to improve the overall performance of transportation in the Metro Denver area.
• I think the job is generally well done, but certain problem areas exist. Some are not the GM's "fault", such as low operator head count, and the continuing regulatory problems with some of
the FasTracks corridors, but nonetheless, the GM and the Board have responsibility for them. "The buck stops here" is a motto that applies, for both good and bad results. I am also
concerned by the failure to push for completion of FasTracks, because that is a promise to our constituents. Similarly, I believe the Agency can do a better job in communicating with
stakeholders and the public when problems hang on for an acceptably long time.
• Next time: Fiscal Sustainability > need to sell naming rights Workforce > assure we are not dropping runs Communications > reorganization and replacement manager Transit services
> G line should be running this survey needs a comment box at the end of each goal. LIMITED character limit, for just a brief comment
• Keep up the good work. Hopeful for a G Line opening in 2018. Concerned about dispute with DTP and what it could mean for the industry. Also, concerned that it could negatively impact
efforts to complete or start existing projects like SH-119 BRT, system optimization or potential unsolicited proposals.
• GM is doing an outstanding job given the current climate.
• I think that Dave has 5 years to address the issues that I and other Board members point out. Board members come and go every two years. Dave’s been around for over 25 years and
probably has a much better grasp of the state of the agency than I do.
• Some of the goals for which Dave has agreed and been tasked are not necessarily achievable given some events beyond Dave's control, but I would give Dave a solid A minus and so the
answer to Question 14 for me would be somewhere between "achieved goal" and "exceeds expectations" with a lean toward the latter.
