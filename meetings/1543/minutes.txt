Recommended Actions Revised Fiscal Policy Statements 2010
Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, requested that the committee table this
item at this time due to comments received from Directors James and Tayer
that staff would like to incorporate into the policy document. Mr. Howerter
asked for additional comments from the Board so they could be reviewed and
incorporated into the document. Mr. Howerter would also like to review the
accounting policies and bring back a document back on February 23, 2010 for
discussion at the Study Session or if there are not substantial changes, staff
would present a red line copy at the March 9, 2010 Financial Administration
Committee.
Motion:
Director McMullen made a motion
to table this item.

Second:

Director Bagley seconded the
motion.

Vote on Motion:

The motion passed unanimously.

Committee Chair Tayer encouraged the Board to review the document and
submit comments on it to staff. Director Martinez asked if there were any
significant changes to the document in case more discussion was warranted.
Chair Tayer said there were references to funding for buses but no accounting
for the rail system and an item on reserve for Union Station which may no
longer be relevant. Chair Tayer said it was more an issue of relevancy rather
than changes in policy.
II.

Updated on RTD 2006A Interest Rate Exchange Agreements – Teresa Sedmak gave this
update. The swap between RTD and JP Morgan was modified such that the effective
date of the transaction was extended from February 1, 2010 to February 1, 2011 at a
cost to RTD of $6,798,000 and an increase in the fixed rate from 4.0518% to
4.0718%. JP Morgan in no longer actively seeking new swap business. The swap
between RTD and UBS was moved to Morgan Stanley and the variable rates were
converted from the SIFMA index to LIBOR which is a much more liquid index. We also
gave Morgan Stanley the option to cancel this swap if the mark to market on that swap
became 0 and no one owed anyone anything. This was a cost of $7 million. The third
one was with Royal Bank of Canada which was also changed from SIFMA to LIBOR and
changed the rate from 4.0518% to 3.855%. RBC also has the ability to terminate at par
and this was a cash cost of $6.9 million. Ms. Sedmak will be constantly monitoring
these swaps and coming back to the Board with further information as time goes on.
Director McMullen wanted to know how Ms. Sedmak saw the market compared to a
year ago. Ms. Sedmak said the market has calmed down and credit is slowly opening up
again and banks are getting back to business. By moving the swaps from SIFMA to
LIBOR index, we are in a much more liquid market with more room to move.
Director Christopher asked if the District will be using swaps again anytime soon. Ms.
Sedmak said she would leave it out there as an option but doesn’t see any new
transactions of this type.

III. Fourth Quarter 2009 Investment Report – Ms. Sedmak gave this report. The report was
distributed in the packet.
The District underperformed on the liquidity tier but
outperformed on the Enhanced cash and short-term tiers. The 2009 current yield of the
District’s unrestricted portfolio was 3.3% which is fairly respectable given the financial
climate and it yielded $15.8 million to the District.
Chair Tayer asked about the liquid cash equivalents underperforming. Ms. Sedmak
shared that she is having a difficult time getting an appropriate index for that tier. It is
mostly money-market account and short term investments. She is continuing to look for
a better benchmark and she will be back to the Board with a change.

IV. Fourth Quarter Internal Audit Report - Bill Holmes, Internal Auditor, introduced Kevin
Parker, the new senior auditor to the committee. Mr. Holmes also distributed a follow-up
summary on open audit action items. A copy of this summary is available in the
Financial Administration Meeting Minute notebook. Chair Tayer asked the Committee to
review the document and submit questions to staff.
Director Daly asked about the audit on the contractors’ cash controls and wanted to
know what was going on. Mr. Holmes shared that staff reductions have resulted on
RTD relying on the contractors and their procedures and have abandoned previous
procedures. His comments to Mr. Howerter were to revise the procedures and to meet
the staffing that we have. Mr. Holmes did some sampling at the contractors and found
their controls to be equal to the District. He doesn’t see any risk at this point but would
like to see the District be more proactive. Mr. Howerter shared that a special group has
been put together to create an audit procedure and check compliance at the vendor
shops as opposed to RTD counting the cash. This will be resolved by March 31, 2010.
V. December 2009 Financial Status Report – Unaudited – Robert Merriman gave this report.
These are the unaudited financial statements so this may change a bit. The District is
ending the year with revenue ridership down 5.2%. Sales and use tax is down 10.3%
from 2008. Fare revenue is up 7.8% at the end of 2009.
Director Brohl asked what kind of a correlation we are doing with fares versus ridership
decline. Are we reaching the point of diminishing returns where our fares are too high?
Mr. Merriman said it really is unemployment that is driving the decline in ridership. Bruce
Abel shared that if we had reached the point of diminishing returns, we would see a
reduction in overall fares which is not the case.
Director Bagley said that the loss in jobs, reduction in price of gasoline, parking
management, and the cost of parking downtown are all factors in this equation. We are
lucky that our farebox revenue has increased during this time.
Director Tobiassen shared that Denver Community College enrollment is up by 33% and
asked if we have seen an increase in campus pass use. Bruce Abel said that there is an
increase in ridership from the Auraria campus but it is difficult to track it to a particular
institution.
Director Christopher wanted to know if we could know if parking management revenue
could be incorporated into the report. Dave Genova let the committee know that they
will be coming to the Board at the February 26, 2010 Study Session with an update on
parking management and will incorporate this into the report.
VI. Other Matters – There were no other matters discussed.
VII. Next Meeting Date – The next meeting of the Financial Administration Committee will be
March 9, 2010.
VIII. Adjourn – Hearing no objection, Chair Tayer adjourned the meeting at 6:04 p.m.
