Service Committee Agenda Packet for April 8, 2014. She highlighted the
areas of IT software and upgrades/testing/integration, concrete repair,
electrical work, consulting, construction, snow removal and custodial
services as the main specializations Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE)
and Small Business Enterprise (SBE) firms that have been contracted through
the Base System. She recognized Carnation Building Services, JCOR
Mechanical, Manion Construction, P&H Equipment, and Triunity as champion
DBE/SBEs that have exceled on the Base System.
