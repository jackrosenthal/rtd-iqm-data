August Financial Status Report
Robert Merriman, Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, discussed the information in
this report with the Financial Administration Committee. An updated report was passed
out. The sales tax numbers will not be in until later this week, so they were not included
in report.
The highlights that Robert touched on are as follows:
Monthly Boardings – August 2007
 Total monthly boardings were estimated to be 8.1% higher in August 2007 than in
August 2006. The number of days of weekday service in August 2007 was 23 and
23 in August 2006. August 2007 average weekday Ridership was 321,268
boardings, which is 7.4% higher than August 2006 average weekday ridership of
299,003 boardings.
 Total revenue service boardings were estimated to be 14.5% higher in August 2007
than in August 2006. That is an increase of 895,804 boardings in August 2007 over
August 2006, of which 66% is attributable to LRT Service growth and the remaining
growth resulted mainly from increased utilization of Denver Local Service.
