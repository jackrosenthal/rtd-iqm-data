REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ____ SERIES OF 2016
(RTD Position on Senate Bill 16-123)

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 16-123 was introduced in the Colorado Senate on February 1, 2016, and
assigned to the Senate Committee on Transportation. The bill was heard in the Senate
Transportation Committee on February 18, 2016, and passed amended to the Committee of the
Whole for second reading on the Senate floor.
WHEREAS, The provisions of SB 16-123 prohibit the Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT) from requiring a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) to use a switchable transponder or
other device in order to drive on a HOV lane or high occupancy toll (HOT) lane on a state
highway on a toll-free basis.
WHEREAS, This bill will negatively impact the High Performance Enterprise’s (HPTE)
contract with Plenary Roads Denver and their revenue projections for Plenary to collect tolls
throughout the 50-year life of the contract.
WHEREAS, Prohibiting the requirement that HOV lane users carry a transponder will lead to
an increase in HOV lane use by vehicles without transponders. Adding the HOV lanes was
part of the voter-approved FasTracks program, and RTD was the single largest funding
source.
WHEREAS, Increased traffic in the HOV lane could impact the Flatiron Flyer BRT schedules
and slow the buses progress to a similar speed of the general purpose lanes.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that RTD Board of Directors adopts a position in opposition
of Senate Bill 16-123.
Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on this
29th day of March 2016.

Local Government Relations Update

The following are items for March 8, 2015:
1. Transportation Funding Discussions – The Colorado Contractors Association,
Associated General Contractors of Colorado, the Colorado Construction Industry
Coalition and Move Colorado are preparing to move forward with a transportation
funding measure for the 2016 ballot. Exact elements of a ballot question are still
being worked out, including any allocations for transit funding. The Metro Mayors
Caucus will hold a special meeting on March 14 to discuss. In addition,
conversations continue about a possible state “deBrucing” ballot measure
following the Build a Better Colorado (BBCO) effort. We also are watching how
the hospital provider fee negotiations might impact both of the above.
2. CAC update – There are 5 open seats on the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee.

Media releases and other communications regarding the application process went
out last week. Applications from interested citizens are due by the end of the
month.

Board Update

HB16-1008 Roadway Shoulder Access for Buses sponsored by Reps. Winter and J Becker and
Senators Cooke and Heath. The bill passed on Third Reading in the Senate and will be sent to
the Governor and we anticipate a quick signing.
HB16-1010 Destructive Rodent Pest Release Authorization Requirements sponsored by Rep.
Priola and Senator Sonnenberg. Under current law, a person may not release destructive rodent
pests into a county without prior approval from the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission
and the corresponding county commissioners. An exemption to this requirement allows rodent
pests to be released into a county from which the animals were originally captured. This bill
removes the exemption, and requires that individuals give prior notification to any conservation
district in which the rodents are to be released. The bill is not currently scheduled for a
hearing. RTD is monitoring the bill.
SB16-037 Public Access Digitally Stored Data under CORA sponsored by Senator Kefalas and
Rep. Pabon. The bill makes modifications to existing legal requirements under the "Colorado
Open Records Act" (CORA) pertaining to the inspection of public records. The bill was
postponed indefinitely in the Senate State Veterans and Military Affairs Committee on a party
line vote.
SB16-123 Free Access to High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes sponsored by Senator Lundberg and
Rep. Singer is on the Second Reading Calendar in the Senate. Senator Jones passed an
amendment that would remove the $15-dollar fee for the transponder and refund those who had
paid $15 in the past. The bill was laid over after the Jones amendment was added. The bill
prohibits the Department of Transportation or the High-Performance Transportation Enterprise
from requiring a vehicle owner to use a switchable transponder or other device in order to travel
in a high occupancy vehicle on either a high occupancy vehicle lane or a high occupancy toll
lane on a toll-free basis. BBMK would recommend RTD oppose this legislation as it could have
negative impacts to RTD’s operation in the 36 corridor.
HB16-1186 MAP-21 Rail fixed Guideway Safety Fund Grant Match sponsored by Rep. Tyler
and Senator Baumgardner is waiting to be scheduled in the House Appropriations Committee.
Current law requires 3% of the fixed utilities fund (FUF) to be sent to the general fund. HB161186 proposes diverting up to $150,000 from the transfer in order to fulfill the 20% match
required by MAP21. RTD is monitoring this bill.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: MARCH 8, 2016
US DOT Implementation of the FAST Act:


As a part of its February 16 apportionment notice for FY 2016 funding under the FAST Act,
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has published preliminary implementation
instructions and guidance explaining program changes made by the bill.



The FAST Act includes new funding thresholds for Small Starts: projects with less than $300
million in total capital costs and $100 in Section 5309 funding now qualify.
o Under these increased thresholds, the FTA now considers the Southeast Rail
Extension (SERE) project to be a Small Start, not a New Start.

TIGER Grant Opportunity:


On February 23, US DOT announced the 8th round of its enormously popular TIGER
competitive grant program, which focuses on innovative projects that might not receive
funding under traditional formula grant programs.
o Congress has provided $500 million for TIGER. The program will continue to focus
on capital projects that generate economic development and improve access to
reliable, safe, and affordable transportation for both urban and rural communities.
o There are no pre-applications required this year; applications are due on April 29.

President’s FY 2017 Budget Proposal:


On February 9, the President released his FY 2017 budget proposal. For transportation, the
budget again calls for a dramatic 40 percent increase in transportation funding: $73 billion,
up from the FY 2016 authorized level of $53 billion. The majority of this funding increase
($17.9b out of $20b) would focus on reducing the environmental impacts of transportation
through a “21st Century Clean Transportation Initiative.”
o Transit programs would receive more than $6 billion in additional funding under the
clean transportation plan, including 50 percent increases in New Starts and transit
formula funding and $525 million for BRT projects in fast-growing communities.
o The budget also recommends $175 million for the Eagle FFGA. (Our request is for
$167 million).



To pay for his clean transportation initiative, the President proposes to levy a $10.25 per
barrel tax on petroleum.



This budget is a messaging piece – a way to convey the Administration’s final-year priorities –
and could only be realized through significant changes in transportation and tax laws. The
transportation proposals almost certainly will not be adopted by Congress, which has no
intention of revisiting the fundamentals of the 5-year bill it just passed in December. Also,
this Congress has proved in the past year to have no appetite for a petroleum tax or other
user fee increases to fund surface transportation programs.

Washington Fly-In and APTA Legislative Conference:


We look forward to seeing you in Washington next week!

Packet Pg. 37

Attachment: Federal Update 3 8 16 (2709 : Federal Update)

o Because the SERE has proceeded nearly to the point of signing an FFGA as a
traditional New Start, the benefits of Small Starts’ simpler project development
process may be limited.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager
and CEO

Date: March 3, 2016

From:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant
General Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

March 2, 2016

Board Meeting Date: March 29, 2016

Subject:

Operations and Maintenance – North Metro
Rail Line

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing the General
Manager to procure and/or execute any necessary work orders, change orders and amendments with
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries/subcontractors for the operation and maintenance and
any additional capital requirements for the North Metro Rail Line in accord with the Board approved
annual budget up to the start of revenue passenger service of the North Metro Rail Line.
BACKGROUND
On June 29, 2010 the RTD Board of Directors passed Resolution 10 authorizing the General Manger to
execute a Concession Agreement for the Eagle Project. The Eagle Project includes the East Corridor,
Gold Line and a portion of the Northwest Rail Line. The Concession Agreement also anticipated that the
Concessionaire may be required to participate in other RTD commuter rail projects.
The Concession Agreement authorizes the Concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), to enter into
an operations and maintenance subcontract for the Eagle Project, and DTP has done so with Denver
Transit Operators (DTO). That subcontract does not cover the North Metro Rail Line. The attached
resolution authorizes the General Manager to negotiate and execute all necessary work orders, change
orders and amendments for operations and maintenance services required to complete testing and
commissioning and to maintain the rail vehicles and other systems as needed prior to revenue passenger
service of the North Metro Rail Line, all within the Board approved annual budget. This grant of
authority will avoid the need for a separate Board action for contract amendments or change orders to
implement those Board approved expenditures.
DISCUSSION
RTD had the opportunity of acquiring the rail vehicles needed for operation on the North Metro Rail Line
at a commercially attractive cost and assuring consistency within the commuter rail fleet. The rail
vehicles acquired will be delivered during 2016 and will require maintenance to assure they are kept fully
serviceable. It is proposed that the fleet be utilized on the Eagle Project in the interim period prior to the
start of revenue passenger operations on the North Metro Rail Line as this will assure the best possible
condition is maintained.

Packet Pg. 38

3.B.1

As the North Metro Rail Line approaches final test and commissioning there will be a need to dispatch
and operate rail vehicles on the line as part of the system proving. Certain of the rail systems such as
the overhead contact system, train control and at-grade crossing system will require maintenance in
accordance with safety and FRA requirements. Denver Transit Partners through DTO has the facility,
equipment and labor capable of providing these services efficiently.
Staff has commenced the process of acquiring the operations and maintenance services required for
revenue passenger service on the North Metro Rail Line and will seek approval of the recommended
approach when that has been determined.
Each year, up to the start of revenue passenger service on the North Metro Rail Line, staff will include
the annual amount for these services in the RTD annual budget. Without the attached Resolution,
contract amendments, change orders or separate agreements in excess of the General Manager’s
Authority would need to be individually approved by the Board, in addition to the Board’s approval of the
budget and RTD service changes. Following approval of the budget by the Board, staff will notify DTP
and or its subsidiaries of such approval requiring them provide the required commuter rail operations and
maintenance, and any additional capital requirements for the coming year. This process is clearly
defined in the Concession Agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommendation will be completed within the budget approved by the Board for 2016 and each
subsequent year.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended that the Board of Directors pass the attached
resolution authorizing the General Manager to procure and/or execute any necessary work orders,
change orders and amendments with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries/subcontractors
for the operation and maintenance and any additional capital requirements for the North Metro Rail
Line in accord with the Board approved annual budget up to the start of revenue passenger service of
the North Metro Rail Line.
2. Decline the recommendation and require staff to seek approval each year or for each change as
frequently as may be required.

GENERAL MANAGER AUTHORITY FOR PRE-REVENUE PASSENGER SERVICE
MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS FOR NORTH METRO RAIL LINE
Whereas, pursuant to Resolution 10, Series of 2010 the RTD Board of Directors
authorized entry into a Concession Agreement with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for the
design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of the Eagle Project which
includes the East, Gold and a portion of the Northwest Rail lines; and,
Whereas, the Concession Agreement anticipated the possibility of the
Concessionaire participating in other RTD commuter rail lines; and,
Whereas, the North Metro Rail Line procured rail vehicles through the Concession

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager
and CEO

Date: March 2, 2016

From:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant
General Manager, Capital Programs

Date:

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

NORTH METRO
ACQUISITION

PROJECT

PROPERTY

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro
Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the North Metro Project the
right of way necessary for the construction of the project. Property needs will be identified and specific
legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition process. This process begins with good faith
negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like
to proceed with the acquisition of all property identified, subject to any modifications or additions
required by the contractor and/or construction activities.
DISCUSSION
On September 20, 2011, June 11, 2013, and March 25, 2014, the RTD Board approved the acquisition
of properties for the North Metro Project. As detailed final design has progressed by the design-build
contractor, additional acquisitions have been identified. These acquisitions are necessary for project
construction.
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the property that has been delineated by design and authorizes the General
Manager and/or his designee to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the approved North Metro cost to complete budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached resolution. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the North Metro Project and authorizing staff to proceed with all
requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2016
NORTH METRO PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the North Metro Project;
and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans and tabulation
sheets, which list the property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just
compensation to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the additional identified Properties and to
obtain immediate possession of the properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall
have the authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of
the Properties as it deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title
38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by
the North Metro Project, although financially compensated according to the law,
makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by
others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public
purpose, that there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within
the corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose, and that the additional
acquisitions are for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as
the Board’s delegatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.

Packet Pg. 44

3.B.2

The Board directs that the RTD delegatees should negotiate in good faith for
the acquisition of the property and if the delegatee is unable to acquire any
property through good faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such property
through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate
with property owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to
address concerns of owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively
impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of
the Properties as soon as permitted by law.
