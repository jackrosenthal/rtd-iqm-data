BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Date:

Subject:

Approval of Bank Signature Authorization

Board Meeting Date: August 15, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).
BACKGROUND
Wells Fargo, as the District’s commercial bank, requires prompt notification of all modifications in the
authorized signatories on the District’s various bank accounts. In order to reflect any changes in District
personnel and the election of new Board officers, the Agreement is updated at least annually and
periodically as otherwise required.
DISCUSSION
The attached recommended Agreement has been modified from the previously approved Agreement only
to reflect the addition of a new checking account which will be used solely for paying invoices related to
the winding down of the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA). Funds deposited in this
account will be transferred to RTD from the DUSPA. The creation and use of this account will enable
RTD to clearly account for the remaining DUSPA funds as DUSPA’s remaining obligations are paid over
time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommended Board action poses no financial impact to the District.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the
“Agreement”).
2.
Modify the attached Agreement.
Do not adopt the attached Agreement.

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the second quarter of 2017 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the second
quarter of 2017. The U.S. unemployment rate declined modestly over the period to 4.4% and general
inflationary pressures remained tame.
In order to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Federal
Reserve chose to raise the target range for the federal funds to 1 to 1.25% in June. The Federal
Reserve stated “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further
improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.”
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

2nd Quarter

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

0.258%

Enhanced Cash Tier:
RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

1.C.1

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the second quarter of 2017 was 1.3% which
would produce annualized earnings of $3,868,784. The current yield for the month of June was 1.42%.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
reflected in the following graph:

Historical performance of RTD Enhanced Cash Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy
benchmark is reflected in the following graph:

SmartCard Project Update

Board Meeting Date: August 8, 2017
Information

The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card which customers load and
reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass
and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All bus installations are complete for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as buses
are purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line, B Line to Westminster
and R Line to Aurora. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge. 191
Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 475,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
July 2017, 1.2M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide portal went
live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the portal was launched to the general public. As of
July 23, 2017, approximately 7,700 cards were issued, of which 5,200 (68%) were full fare cards and
2,500 (32%) were discount cards. The average stored value loaded (initial purchases and reloads) was
$44.80, with a total value loaded of $788,000. There were 183,000 trips taken using these MyRide
cards with a fare payment value of over $517,000. Of these trips: 72% were local, 25% regional and
3% airport.
MyRide Stored Value Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public through the MyRide
web portal. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the
card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales
outlets and at Retail outlets (Safeway and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash
value onto MyRide cards at 50 Safeway retail stores. As of July 1, 2017, customers can load cash
value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores.
As of January 1, 2017, Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc. separated its Business Process Services Unit into
an independent public company called Conduent. Xerox will be referred to as Conduent.

The service provider for this
hosting is NewPush. They are in
the processes of maintaining
Payment Card Industry (PCI)
compliance standards.
Disaster Recovery environment
testing has identified issues and all
issues have been resolved.
For a variety of reasons, there has
been a small percentage of cards in
circulation that requires an
administrative action to extend
their usability. Remediation was
made to some of these cards in
March 2016 which yielded positive
results. Challenges continue to
remain and for this reason, the
status is shown as yellow.

Initial Disaster Recovery
testing is complete and
successful.
Plans are in development
to conduct a longer
Disaster Recovery test
planned for early
September.

RTD and Conduent
continue to monitor.
Issues are documented
and reviewed weekly
with the Conduent
Technical Team.

RTD working with
Conduent to complete
functionality that was
deferred. Deferred
functionality includes
auto-reload functionality
with a target release in
2018.
