BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 GM-CEO Short-term Goals

January 21, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
January 28, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve, pursuant to the GM/CEO’s performance framework adopted in
January 2024 in alignment with the Board’s employment agreement with the GM/CEO, the proposed
short-term SMART goals for the performance period commencing January 28, 2025, and continuing
through October 15, 2025.
BOARD REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Guzman, Chair, Performance Committee
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO)
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the performance assessment framework adopted by the Board during the monthly Board
meeting held on January 30, 2024, the Board is responsible for motivating, assessing, and rewarding
the agency’s GM/CEO in relation to short-term (annual) and long-term performance.
The attainment of short-term goals directly tied to agency Strategic Initiatives is a critical element of the
GM/CEO’s annual performance, as is performance related to core job duties and values.
On December 4, 2023, the Board adopted a fifth amendment to the contract to adjust the Board’s
annual deadline to adopt the goals and metrics upon which the GM/CEO will be evaluated in the coming
year from December 31 to January 31. Following an election year, this timing also allows newly elected
Board members an opportunity to participate in the goals and metrics development discussion.
On December 10, 2024, the Board adopted an eighth amendment to the contract, which included the
following terms, among other provisions:
•

•

For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for an increase to the Adjusted Base Salary between 1 and 7% as set
by the Board
By January 31 each year, after consultation with GM/CEO Johnson, the Board must adopt the
Agency Values, Short-term Goals, and performance assessment outcome ratings with
corresponding point distribution for Core/Base Job performance, demonstration of Agency Values,

•

and Attainment of Short-term Goals and associated Adjusted Base Salary percentage increase for
which GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for that year’s performance period
Beginning January 1, 2025, the Board must meet with GM/CEO Johnson each quarter to discuss
her performance, including her progress toward the Short-term Goals
For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is not eligible for a Cost-of-Living Adjustment; however the Board will endeavor
to continue to be guided by the total compensation principles in the Compensation Philosophy

DISCUSSION
In alignment with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, the purpose of this Recommended Action is to align the committee
around the proposed short-term SMART goals and associated weighting for the performance period
commencing January 28, 2025, and continuing through October 15, 2025 (2025 performance period).
The proposed goals for the 2025 performance period, which are tied to the Strategic Initiatives of
Customer and Community Connections, People Power, and Welcoming Transit Environment, are as
follows:
Strategic Initiative: Customer and Community Connections – RTD is committed to fostering community
building and enriching the customer experience.
Short-term Goal 1: No later than September 30, 2025, to increase light rail service availability
to 96% (50% of goal) and to increase annualized on-time performance by 1.5% for both
fixed-route bus and rail service (50% of goal).

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics related to
overall customer satisfaction and perception of on-time performance.
Historically, RTD’s bus and commuter rail service availability metrics have remained above 99%,
meaning that, for every 100 trips scheduled, more than 99 trips are operated. Light rail service
availability has been impacted in recent years due to several factors, including but not limited to
operator availability and state of good repair and preventative maintenance activities. Overall light
rail service availability for 2024 was 94.34%, meaning that, of the 223,205 trips scheduled,
208,412 were actually operated.
On-time performance is influenced by numerous factors, including elements both within RTD’s
control (e.g., operator availability, scheduling, and maintenance) and outside of it (e.g., regional
traffic patterns and road congestion, service impacts resulting from construction and street
detours, weather, and supply chain issues). Increasing on-time performance by even small
increments requires budgetary support as well as a considerable, concerted effort of Bus and Rail
Operations teams as well as Service Planning, Human Resources, Capital Programs personnel
among others.

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

For the first 11 months of 2024, average on-time performance for fixed-route service by mode is
as follows:
•
•
•

Bus: 80.4%
Light Rail: 77.0%
Commuter Rail: 95.2%

Short-term Goal 2: To increase year-over-year fixed-route vehicle boardings by 3% from the
period commencing October 1, 2024, and ending September 30, 2025, while optimizing the
increase in RTD’s 2025 annualized revenue service hours to 3,191,109*.

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics tied to
community perceptions of the value RTD provides to the Denver metro region and of RTD’s
provision of service to major activity centers, as well as the State’s visionary ridership increase
goal of 6%.
RTD continues to optimize service levels and is incrementally approaching the level of service
delivery contemplated in the System Optimization Plan (SOP) adopted by the Board in July 2022.
Funding in calendar year 2025 for the increase in revenue service hours of approximately
102,000 was included in the 2025 Budget, approved by the Board on Tuesday, December 3,
2024.
Annual boardings for the period commencing October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024,
totaled 65,767,000. A 3% year-over-year increase as contemplated in this goal would equate to
nearly 2,000,000 additional boardings, the equivalent of 5,400 additional boardings daily.
*RTD’s estimated 2024 revenue hours totaled 3,089,109. Note that this estimate does not
include demand-response revenue hours.
Strategic Initiative: Welcoming Transit Environment – RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal
behaviors and Code of Conduct violations on agency’s services and workplaces and, in doing so, to
improve community and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and
vehicles.
Short-term Goal 3: To increase customer survey responses by 4% from CY2024 to CY2025 in
relation to questions pertaining to customers’ perception of a) feeling safe and secure while
waiting at stops or stations and b) feeling safe and secure aboard vehicles.

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics related to
customers’ perceptions of personal safety and security.

Packet Pg. 5

1.C.1

Customer Excellence surveys conducted in 2024 indicate that 55% of bus and rail customers felt
personally safe and secure while waiting for fixed-route transit vehicles, and 62% of bus and rail
customers felt personally safe and secure while aboard vehicles. While these responses are
significantly higher than national averages for transit agencies, staff anticipates that an increase
in customer perceptions of safety and security will yield corresponding increases in boardings as
well as customer satisfaction with RTD services.
A draft of these goals is attached for the committee’s consideration during the Performance Committee
meeting scheduled for Tuesday, January 21, 2025. Should the Board not adopt short-term goals for the
GM/CEO by the January 31 deadline specified in the contract, the goals automatically revert to those
adopted for the prior performance period.
For the 2025 performance period, the weighting of the elements of the GM/CEO’s performance
assessment and the salary adjustments that correspond to her attainment of specified performance
levels are as follows:

Assessment Element
Alignment with Agency Values
Core/Base Job Performance
Short-term Goals

Weighting

2025 Performance Committee Work Plan

January 21, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra Johnson, General Manager and Chief Executive Officer
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
Article VI, Section 4 of the Board Bylaws details the purpose of and process for approving committee
work plans as follows:
Each standing and ad hoc committee must create, approve and forward to the full board for
review an annual work plan detailing the major issues the committee will consider throughout the
fiscal year. The work plan shall be developed in collaboration between the respective committee’s
chair, vice chair, and the responsible RTD staff with the input of the committee’s members. The
work plan must be created and approved by the committee no later than March of each year.
Work plans for standing committees may, for purposes of ensuring the continuity of a standing
committee’s work, extend through February of the following fiscal year. Adjustments and
additions to the work plan can be made by the committee chair in consultation with the
committee vice chair and responsible RTD staff.
Additionally, per Article VI, Section 1, f.), describes the role of the Performance Committee as follows:
The Performance Committee has three oversight functions: 1) Performance management of the
General Manager and CEO, 2) in close coordination with the General Manager and CEO, the
development, ongoing review, and subsequent amendment of long-range strategic planning
efforts, including the agency’s Strategic Plan, 3) high-level monitoring of agency performance in
relation to the Strategic Plan.
With respect to the performance management of the GM/CEO, the committee has primary
oversight over the GM/CEO’s employment agreement, annual goalsetting, the annual performance
assessment framework, and annual performance assessment. The Performance Committee is also
the appropriate venue through which the Board members periodically engage in dialogue with the
GM/CEO to discuss feedback regarding the GM/CEO’s ongoing performance.

Packet Pg. 29

1.D.1

The Committee is responsible for monitoring performance metrics related to, and progress
toward, the agency’s Strategic Plan. The Committee will collaborate with the GM/CEO to set the
cadence, timing, and topics of performance updates relative to the Strategic Plan when
developing and adopting its annual committee work plan.
DISCUSSION
The Committee is asked to review the attached draft work plan and gain an understanding of the
committee’s workflow based on the items currently listed. Additionally, the Directors should provide
additional input on items they would like to see included in the work plan that are not already included in
the draft document.
Following the discussion at the committee meeting, General Manager and CEO Johnson and other senior
staff will meet with the chair and vice chair of the committee to further refine the work plan. Additional
discussions on all committee work plans are slated for the 2025 Board Retreat, which is scheduled for
February 1, 2025. And prior to that retreat the Board Office will be soliciting further input from Directors
on items they wish to see on work plans for the Board’s standing committees. The Committee will then
discuss the work plan again at its meeting scheduled for February 3, 2025. And the Committee will look
to approve its work plan at its meeting scheduled for March 3, 2025. Per the Board Bylaws, all
committee work plans must be approved by the end of March each year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to the discussion regarding the Committee’s work plan.
This discussion aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Performance Committee’s ability to effectively govern directly
impacts the overall performance of the agency. A solid committee work plan will ensure RTD’s resources
are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance objectives are more focused,
collaborative, and obtainable.
